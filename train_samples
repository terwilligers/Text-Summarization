There are a couple types of rings, each of which is designed to come out a bit differently.Seamless rings. These rings should have a break in the material. To take it out, bend the ring slightly so the break comes apart, then slide out of your piercing. Segment rings are designed with a separate piece that comes out of the ring. Pull it out in order to remove the ring from your nose, then snap it back in place to close the ring. Because of their size, nose rings can be tricky to pull apart in order to insert or remove. Some companies make opening and closing pliers, special tools to grip the ring, which you might find helpful for seamless rings.  These are common types of jewelry consist of a straight post holding a bead or jewel that is visible. The other end is usually another bead that helps prevent it from falling out. To remove, grab both ends and pull apart.Nose bones are similar types of jewelry, but much more difficult to get out. To change the jewelry, you will effectively need to rip it out of your nose.  This type of jewelry started in India, and has become more popular in the Western world. It consists of a short post that has a hook or “L-bar” at the other end to hold it in place. Just like a stud or pin, to remove you grab both ends and pull.Some types may require you to twist slightly to help the pieces come apart, but that should be fairly easy to get the hang of., If you are having trouble getting your fingers on the jewelry, or have certain types of piercings that you can’t remove, go back to your piercer to have them take it out.

If the area doesn’t heal, you can create scar tissue from the additional trauma to your nose., Twice a day, you should clean the pierced area using sterile cotton swabs dipped in warm water or a saline solution. Dabbing the pierced area should be enough, but be sure to remove any crusty formations on the jewelry. When you are finished, pat the area dry with a paper towel, clean tissue, or dry cotton ball. Be careful not to use towels, as they can snag.To make your own saline solution, rather than buying it, dissolve 1/4 teaspoon of non-iodized sea salt in one cup of lukewarm water. Remember to use different cotton balls or swabs when cleaning the parts of your jewelry inside and outside of your nose.Avoid using strong substances such as tea tree oil, alcohol, betadine, hydrogen peroxide, and methylated spirits. These can lead to scars and lumps on your nose, and will probably create a burning sensation and other irritation., Sometimes you may want to clean just the jewelry, especially if it is getting a little dull.

 If you engage in strenuous and vigorous activities, especially during hot or humid weather, your body will heat up due to the expense of energy and physical exertion.Try exercising in less physically demanding ways, such as walking or cycling. If you insist on maintaining your usual level of workout intensity, be sure to take frequent breaks and avoid over-exerting yourself.Swimming can also be a good way to naturally lower your body temperature while exercising, because you will be submerged in cool water., It's important that your clothing allows air to circulate over your skin to cool you off, but you also want to be sure that your skin is covered to prevent additional sun exposure.Light-colored clothing reflects the sun's light rather than absorbing it, thereby lowering the level of heat in the body. Avoid wearing dark colored and thick clothes, as these clothes are known to attract and trap heat., Hot and spicy foods can increase your metabolism, acting like stimulants to elevate your body temperature.The compound found in chili peppers, capsaicin, naturally raises your body's temperature.Food with a high fat content can lead to more heat being trapped in the body by increased levels of fat stored in the cells. This is because fat is responsible for storing heat in the body and making the body warmer. 

avoid extreme or strenuous activities.  wear light colored and loose-fitting clothes to reduce heat retention.  avoid eating spicy and fatty foods.

As a result, a study was conducted showing that regular physical activity - as little as a half hour each day - improved cognitive functioning, mood, and focus. Students also saw a decrease in the severity of ADHD symptoms.If you or your child have ADHD, try getting regular exercise, in virtually any form, to see if it helps.

One study showed that children with ADHD had higher rates of daytime sleepiness.Therefore, getting adequate sleep at night can help you or your child stay awake while at work or school.   The best tactics to improve sleep quantity and quality lie in developing a regular and consistent sleep pattern. Create a relaxing bedroom environment, and move all other activities elsewhere. Avoid caffeine or alcohol in the evenings for better sleep, too.  Both yoga and meditation promote relaxation and improve moods in people who engage in these activities. These practices place an emphasis on your breath and focusing on sensations within your body, rather than environmental stimuli. Try both or either to see if one helps an ADHD sufferer learn discipline and stress management.  In addition to lifestyle changes, you can consult with a psychologist for non-pharmacological interventions that help alleviate ADHD symptoms. Which interventions your mental health provider uses will depend largely on your unique medical/psychiatric history and symptom patterns. Plus, adults and children generally require different interventions that match their developmental level., Many people shy away from pharmacological treatments of ADHD. However, they have been proven to alleviate symptoms in 85% of cases, particularly for severe manifestations of the disorder. In some cases, lifestyle changes may be sufficient at helping you manage your ADHD. However, if these tactics do not improve your symptoms, see your doctor about a stimulant or non-stimulant medication that may suit your needs. 

eat a healthy balanced diet.  get exercise.  improve your sleep habits.  practice yoga or meditation.  see a professional for behavioral interventions.  don't overlook medications for adhd.

Lay the washer flat and drill one hole at the top and the other hole at the bottom of the washer. For example, the two holes should be located at 12 and 6 o’clock.Position the holes between the pre-existing center hole of the washer and the outer rim.  Place the washer in a bench vise and pinch the washer. It should bend slightly in half. This will form the lock for the snare., Take one end of the cable and thread it through a ¼ inch nut. Then, thread it back through the nut creating a loop. Continue to pull the cable back through the nut until you have a loop with a ¾ inch (2 cm) diameter.Leave an extra inch of cable at the end.  Place the nut on an anvil and hammer the nut so that the cable is fastened in place and the loop is secure.  Then, push the cable through the top hole of the washer, from the outside of the bend to the inside. Pull the cable about a foot through the washer. Then, loop the cable through the bottom hole of the washer from the inside of the bend to the outside.This should create a loop.  Create a stopper at the end of the cable. Thread the end through a ¼ inch nut. There should be about ½ an inch (1 cm) of cable sticking out through the center of the nut., Place the nut on an anvil and hammer it so that the nut tightens around the cable, locking it in place.The snare is now complete and ready to be set.  In order to set a snare trap, you want to place it on a trail or path that is frequented by coyotes. Then, attach the small looped end of the snare to a solid object, such as a fence post or small sapling. This will anchor the snare in place. Hang the larger loop from a nearby branch so that the bottom of the loop is approximately 12 inches (30 cm) off the ground.When a coyote walks past it will mistake the hanging wire for a branch and walk into the snare. The loop will tighten, trapping the coyote as it continues walking and the bent washer will prevent the loop from loosening.

 In a consultation, find out how short he wants his hair, how uniformly he wants it cut, and how he plans to style his hair afterwards. He may want you to only trim away split ends, but he could also want you to cut everything off. Before you begin to cut, it's important that you ask all of the necessary questions and understand what he would like done with his hair. If you are clear and communicative from the start, you will avoid any potential misunderstandings.   When cutting men's hair, break their head up into 7 parts: the top, left side, right side, back, left sideburn area, right sideburn area and the fringe. That way, they can describe to you how much hair they want taken away from each part. Make it a dialogue. As you cut the man's hair, continue to ask him for feedback. Give him access to a mirror (wall-mounted or hand-held) where he can review the cut, and periodically ask him whether it's short enough.; , A man who is losing his hair on the top of his head may love the way Don Draper looks, but may be disappointed when he tries to pull off the same look.   More dramatic hairstyles on men tend to work best when a man has a fuller head of hair. More conservative hairstyles tend to make the best use of thinning hair.  It is important not to be in a hurry when cutting hair, especially if you do not have a lot of experience. You also do not want to have any sort of stimulant in your system, nothing that will make your hands unsteady or interrupt your concentration.  Seat him in a sturdy chair, and make sure you can comfortably reach his head with your hands. Cover his shoulders with a barber’s cape, bed sheet, or towel to keep the hair off of him and to make cleaning up easier. Try fixing the sheet around his neck with a pin or a clip so that it doesn't slip off. Cover his neck with a neck strip, which you can buy at a local beauty supply store.   Make sure to set up on a floor surface that will be easy to clean afterwards. Tile, wood, linoleum, and concrete are all great choices. Carpet—especially thick carpet—will swallow clipped hair and make cleaning up difficult. Bathrooms, kitchens, and patios are good for hair-cutting. Use a pair of very sharp, high quality shears that are specifically made for cutting hair. Scissors made for cutting paper or fabric will not lead to the results you want to achieve with his hair.  Dampen his hair by spritzing with a spray bottle. If the hair is too wet to work with, towel it gently dry.  This should also give you an idea about how and where to cut. Comb hair in the desired style: some men prefer the part on the right side of the head, and other men prefer it down the middle of the head.  You can use the clippers to trim the back and sides of the head, to tidy up loose bits around the ears, or even to buzz the entire head to a uniform length. Clippers come with blade-guard attachments that determine the length of the hair that gets cut. The longer the attachment, the less hair that gets cut. Many men have a preference on what guard you use, so it’s a good idea to ask him if there’s one that he prefers. Most clipper sets come with six guides. The lower the guide number, the shorter his hair will be:   Use a six to keep a little length. Use a three or four for a classic cut. Use a two for a close cut, and a one for a "buzz cut".  Your grip should be strong and steady, but comfortable. You don't need to squeeze or do anything fancy with this clippers; you might hurt someone.  Hold the clippers against his scalp, and run them through his hair from the nape of his neck to about halfway up his head. Round the clippers up and out to finish that cut. Work around to the sides, always cutting upward and against the direction the hair is growing.          Work your way slowly around the head. Cut carefully around the ears. Leave the top for the scissors.  To line up the back, the goal is to keep the existing hair line, and take off the strays outside of the hairline. Turn the clippers upside-down and press the blades perpendicular to the head and cut downwards. Be sure to get the rat-tail in the middle. Whoever does the line should have the recipient look down to get a close cut, then look up to preview what it looks like when finished.  The sides are trickier than the back, but the goal is usually to push the line up and off the ears. Turn the clippers on their side and use the edge of the blade, cutting from the back to the front, going against the grain. Try to tilt the blades at an angle so it fades in.  Use a spray bottle to lightly spritz the uncut hair. Comb the hair forward and make an imaginary line down the center of his head, as if it were in between his eyes separating the right side from the left side. You can also section the hair with clips if you need to.  Beginning at the back and working forward along your imaginary line, comb up a half-inch section of hair. Pinch the hair between your index and middle finger, slide your fingers up or down to the length you want. The hair below your fingers will stay on his head; the hair above your fingers will be trimmed away. Snip the hair at an angle, with hair-cutting scissors, so it won’t look blunt or uneven.          Cut perpendicular to the hair direction for a clean cut. For example, if his hair points downwards, towards the back of the neck (vertical), cut horizontally across the back of his head. Don't cut in one big clip with the whole scissor blade. Use the tips or the scissor blades for cutting in short spurts. If you're nervous, cut just a bit at a time. You can always cut more if you need to.  You should notice the length difference where you just cut. When cutting a new section of hair, always take part of the just-cut section between your fingers so you can use it as a length guide.  Cut along another imaginary line. Using the prior cut as your guide, make another "line" to either the right or left of your original one. Begin cutting, once again, from the back of the head to the front. Use the already trimmed section as a guide and cut any hairs that stick up past that length. Continue sectioning and cutting the hair from front to back, always taking a bit of the previous section to show you where to cut.  When you reach the front of his head, comb his bangs down. Ask him how long he wants his bangs to be if you didn’t already during the consultation. Holding the scissors vertically with the tips pointing up, make little snips using the points of the scissors. Cut at an angle for better blending.   Be careful with bangs. The "golden rule" is: "Once you cut it, it's gone." Always remember that you can cut more off, but you can't add it back, so you must be sure of where you're cutting. Make sure that the bangs are damp, but take drying into account. Cutting dry hair causes it to fly everywhere, and can fray the ends in some cases. However, curly hair can shrink up to 4 inches (10.2 cm) when it dries. Even straight hair can shrink as much as 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm). If you haven't cut bangs before, err on the side of caution.  Using the fine-tooth end of the comb, comb upward at the point where the clipper cut meets the scissor cut. Use the scissors to trim the hair that pokes out of the comb, blending away, or ‘fading,’ the harsh line that separates the clipper cut from the scissor cut. This is called the shear-over-comb technique. Work all the way around the head.          As you use the comb, hold it with the teeth pointing straight up, making sure you aren't angling it towards or away from you.  Using the clippers without an attachment, trim the neck and hair around his ears. Trim his sideburns, stepping back occasionally to look at him head-on and make sure they’re even. Start at the top and work the clippers downward so you don’t clip too high.          If he asks you to trim his beard, you can use the clippers to either shave or clean up the hair below his sideburns. If you are shaving, you can use a razor (for a close shave) or the clippers without any attachment (for a rough shave). If you are cleaning up the beard: ask him how short he'd like it, and choose a clipper attachment accordingly. You can also use scissors to evenly snip away the longest hairs of his beard.  Look over to make sure that you haven't missed any spots. Carefully touch up any rough areas with scissors or clippers. Let the man see your handiwork in the mirror, and ask for feedback to see whether he likes it. You can always cut more if needed. Make any final touches to the cut.  Gently towel his hair and neck dry. Consider briefly blow-drying his neck to remove any loose hairs. Add styling products, if the man wants you to.  Take a minute to sweep all of the loose hair clippings into a small, out-of-the way pile. This is a necessary safety precaution to take because hair can make the floor very slippery. Afterwards, wash your comb/scissors/shaver.   If he isn't wearing shoes, the hair can go through his socks. Sometimes you can get an ingrown hair, where a hair grows the wrong way. This is very painful. If he is wearing shoes, the hair can stick to the soles of the shoes, and could be dragged around the house.  

ask the man how he wants his hair.  choose a haircut that will suit the man's face and the amount of hair he has on his head.  make sure that you have plenty of time.  set up the work area.  always start with clean hair: if you are using electric clippers, start with dry hair; if you are using only scissors, slightly damp hair is easier to work with.  detangle his hair by running a comb through it.  choose a clipper attachment.  hold the clippers firmly between your thumb and first two fingers.  start clipping at the base of his head.  line up the back of the head.  line up the sides.  dampen the top of the man's head, and comb the hair forward.  trim the top.  after cutting your entire line, comb the hair forward again and begin at the very front of the head.  blend the top of the head.  trim his bangs.  blend scissor cuts with a clipper cut.  trim his neck and sideburns.  comb one last time after the entire head has been trimmed.  wash or spritz his hair one more time, just to clean out any lingering hair clippings.  sweep the floor before you let him out of the chair. 

 Every time you visit a website, it will log your IP address (your computer's "address" on the internet), what site you're coming from, the browser you are using, your operating system, how long you spend on the site, and what links you click.  Your search engine queries are associated with your IP address (and account if you are logged in). These are compiled and analyzed to more accurately target ads and provide relevant search results.  If your computer is logged into any social networks (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), these networks will be able to track your browsing history if the websites you visit have social network plugins ("Like" buttons, Retweets, etc.).  This is most commonly used to determine if customers are using the network to download torrents of copyrighted materials.  No matter how much you cover your tracks, there is always some information that can potentially be used to profile and potentially identify you. The goal of using anonymity tools is to reduce the amount of information available, but due to the nature of the internet, you cannot ever be truly anonymous.  It's not exactly easy to stay anonymous online, and requires a significant amount of conscious effort. You'll face much slower connections when browsing websites, and you'll have to jump through more hoops before you even go online. If your anonymity is important to you, be prepared to make some sacrifices.   The next section will cover how to keep your personal information from being tied to your IP address, but does not guarantee anonymity. To increase your anonymity online, see the two sections at the end of this article.  Make sure that the email address does not contain any personal information, and is not tied to any accounts that store your personal information.    Click here for details on creating a disposable email address.; , Major search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo! all track your searches and tie them to your IP address. Use an alternative search engine that does not track your searches, such as DuckDuckGo or StartPage.  If you've used the internet for more than a week, chances are you have a hefty number of passwords to keep track of. It can be tempting to use the same password, or slight variations, for multiple sites to make things easier for you, but this is a massive security risk. If one website with your password and email is hacked, every site that you use that same combination with is in jeopardy. A password manager will remember the passwords for each site you visit, allowing you to create strong and even random passwords for each one.    Click here for detailed instructions on setting up a password manager. With a password manager, you don't need to worry about creating a password you can remember. Instead, you can create strong passwords that are virtually impossible to crack. "Kz2Jh@ds3a$gs*F%7" is a much stronger password than "MyDogName1983".  When it comes to online anonymity, things can get technical real quick. Before you start diving in, it will help to have a basic understand of some of the more common terms.    Traffic - In networking terms, traffic is the transfer of data from one computer to another.  Server - This is a computer located remotely that hosts files and sets up connections. All websites are stored on servers that you access using your web browser.  Encryption - This is the act of protecting data sent over a network by using a randomly generated code. When data is encrypted, it is scrambled according to the unique code that only you and the server have. This ensures that if the data is intercepted, it cannot be decoded.  Proxy - A proxy server is a server that is configured to collect and then resend network traffic. In essence, a proxy server allows you to connect to it, and then it will send out your requests for websites. It then receives the data from the websites and then sends it to you. This has the benefit of hiding your IP address from the website you are accessing.  VPN - A VPN is a Virtual Private Network. This is an encrypted connection between you and a server. It is traditionally used in corporate environments so that remote workers could remotely and securely access company resources. A VPN can be thought of as a "tunnel" through the internet that connects you directly with a server.  There are thousands of web-based proxies available, and they change every day. These are websites that route traffic through the proxy server. They only affect traffic going through that website; open another tab in your browser and anything you send will be anonymously sent.When using a web-based proxy, avoid any sites that use secure login (Facebook, banking, etc.) as proxy sites should never be trusted. Most web-based proxies cannot display certain content such as videos.  A proxy server is a a server that relays your internet traffic. This has the benefit of masking your personal IP address from sites when you connect through a proxy. The downside is that you have to trust the proxy server to not do anything malicious with your traffic.   There are a wide variety of proxy services available online, both free and paid. Free servers are typically ad-supported. Once you've found a proxy server that you want to connect to, you will need to configure your browser to connect to the server. This will only affect the traffic that originates from your browser (i.e. an instant messaging program will not be relayed through the proxy server unless it is configured to as well). Much like web-based proxies, you should avoid logging into anything secure, as you cannot trust a proxy company to not divulge your data. Do not connect to any "open" proxies. These are proxy servers that have been left open by someone else, and are typically malicious or illegal.  A virtual private network will encrypt your traffic to and from the network, increasing your privacy. It will also make your traffic appear to be originating from the VPN server, much like a proxy server. Most VPNs cost money, and many will still log your traffic in order to comply with government requests.   Don't trust any VPN company that says it doesn't log anything. No VPN will risk getting shut down to protect a single customer from a government request.  Tor is a network that acts as multiple proxies, bouncing your traffic between multiple relays before reaching the destination or you. Only traffic that goes through the Tor Browser will be anonymized, and browsing using the Tor Browser will be significantly slower than regular web surfing.    Click here for detailed information about using Tor., If you want to browse truly anonymously, there are several things you'll want to set up before going online. This may seem like a lot of hassle, but following these steps is the only way to ensure that you have some semblance of anonymity online.   This method will help you configure your own person VPN on your own personal, out-of-country server. This is much more secure than subscribing to a VPN service, as you can't always trust a company to be safe with your data.  Your computer has a lot of services that connect to the internet, each of which can compromise your online anonymity without you realizing it. Windows is especially insecure, as well as Mac OS X to a lesser extent. The first step to being anonymous is to install Linux to a virtual machine, which is like a computer within a computer.A virtual computer has a "wall" around it that prevents any data from crossing over to your physical computer. This is essential for keeping your physical computer's signature from showing up while browsing anonymously.  Click here for detailed instructions on installing Linux on a virtual machine. The entire process is free, but may take about an hour. TailsOS is one of the most popular privacy-oriented Linux distributions. It is very lightweight and entirely encrypted.  This will set you back a few dollars every month, but will help ensure that you are browsing anonymously. It is important to subscribe to a VPS in another country, so that traffic to and from the VPS can't be tracked to your home IP address.   You will be using your VPS to install VPN (Virtual Private Network) software onto. This will allow you to connect through your VPN, masking your actual IP address. Pick a VPS service that allows you to pay with methods that don't reveal your identity, such as DarkCoin. Once you sign up for a VPS, you'll need to install your own operating system on it. Install one of the following Linux distributions to allow easy setup for your VPN: Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, or Debian. Note that your VPS provider can still be hit with a court order to reveal your VPN information if your government suspects that illegal activity is happening on your VPN. There really isn't much you can do to prevent this.  The VPN is what your computer will connect to in order to access the internet. This will essentially make it appear as if you are browsing from the VPS's location, not your home, as well as encrypt all data to and from the VPS. This step is a little more complicated than installing a virtual operating system. It is arguably the most important step however, so if anonymity is important to you, make sure to complete this. These steps are specifically for OpenVPN on Ubuntu, one of the more reliable free VPN solutions.Log into your VPS operating system. The process for this will vary depending on the VPS service you choose. Visit the OpenVPN website and download the correct software package. There will be multiple options, so make sure to choose the correct one for your VPS's operating system. You can find all the available downloads at openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/download-openvpn-as-sw.html  Open the terminal on your VPS and type dpkg -i openvpnasdebpack.deb to install the OpenVPN software that you downloaded. The command will be different if you're not using Ubuntu or Debian. Type passwd openvpn and set a new password when prompted. This will be the admin password for your OpenVPN software. Open the web browser on your VPS and enter in the address displayed in the terminal. This will open the OpenVPN control panel. Log in with the username openvpn and the password you created. Once you log in for the first time, your VPN is ready to go.  You will need to access the OpenVPN Connect Client to download the configuration file needed for your connection program.   Enter in the same address you used on the VPS to access the admin panel, without the /admin part of the address. Login with your OpenVPN admin account using "openvpn" as the username and the password you created earlier. Download the client.opvn or client.conf file onto your virtual computer.  Once your VPN is configured on your VPS, you'll need to set up your virtual computer to connect directly to it. The following instructions are for Ubuntu and Debian, so you may need to change the commands to match your OS.   Open the terminal and type sudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn-gnome  Wait for the package to download and install. Open the Network Manager and click the "VPN" tab. Click the "Import" button and then select the configuration file that you downloaded. Review your settings. The Certificate and Key fields should populate automatically, and your VPN address should appear in the Gateway field. Click the "IPV4 Settings" tab and select "Automatic (VPN) addresses only" from the Methods drop-down menu. This will ensure that all of your internet traffic is routed through the VPN.  At this point, with your VPS and VPN configured and running, you're browsing with pretty strong anonymity. Your VPN will encrypt all traffic to and from your virtual machine. If you want to take it one step further, the Tor Browser can add another layer of protection, at the cost of browsing speed.You can download the Tor browser from torproject.org  Running Tor through your VPN will hide the fact that you are using Tor from your ISP (they will only see encrypted VPN traffic). Run the Tor installation program. The default settings will provide comprehensive protection for most users. For more detailed information on using Tor, click here.  if you're very concerned about anonymity, you'll want to change VPS providers at least monthly. This means reconfiguring OpenVPN each time, but you'll get faster and faster at it as you repeat the process. Make sure to completely reset a VPS before you switch to the new one., Now that everything is configured, the strength of your anonymity rests on your browsing habits.   Use alternative search engines like DuckDuckGo or StartPage. Avoid any sites with Javascript. Javascript code can be used to reveal IP addresses and deanonymize your traffic. Disconnect from the Tor network when opening files that you downloaded through Tor. Do not download torrent files while connected to the Tor network. Avoid any site that does not use HTTPS (Look in the address bar to see if the site is using HTTP or HTTPS). Avoid installing browser plugins.  

websites track visitors to serve ads and link to social media.  major search engines store your search history.  social networks track where you go.  your isp (internet service provider) can analyze network traffic to see what you are doing online.  complete anonymity is virtually impossible.  when browsing online, you have to make the choice between convenience and anonymity.  use a throwaway email to register for sites.  use privacy-oriented search engines.  use a password manager to keep your passwords strong.  learn some basic terminology.  use a web-based proxy.  connect to a proxy server.  subscribe to a vpn.  use the tor browser.  follow all of the steps in this section.  install linux in a virtual machine on your home computer.  find a vps (virtual private server) host in another country.  set up your own vpn (virtual private network) on the vps.  open a web browser on your virtual computer.  download the openvpn client on your virtual computer.  download the tor browser bundle on your virtual computer.  change vps providers regularly.  surf smartly. 

 It's nice to be at a healthy weight, but don't starve yourself., Avoid doing anything bad that you will regret in the future.  Don't be snobby and condescending, this will make everyone hate you. Avoid giving icy stares. Look upon people with compassion and kind regard.  

stay healthy.  be sweet and thoughtful. 

 Before addressing the financial elements of a personal financial crisis, it is important to address the emotional elements. You have to recognize that emotional turmoil is a normal component of the process. Depending on the cause of your situation, you may experience stress, depression, or anxiety. This may be accompanied by a sense of guilt or failure. You may also feel as if you have no control over your situation.   These emotions are a normal component of going through a financial crisis. While it may be difficult at first, these emotions will likely pass over time as you adjust to your new circumstances, and re-gain control of the situation by taking action.; , When faced with a difficult situation, people often try to deny or ignore the situation. While it may feel better to do this, it does not help in the long run. Accepting your situation can empower you to face your difficulties as they are and conquer them head-on.Accepting the situation is the first step to resolving it. Try to channel any negative energy about the situation into positive, solution-focused actions. For example, instead of dwelling or blaming yourself for a scenario, try taking that negative energy and using it to make a commitment to solve the situation once and for all.  Confide in close friends or family members to talk out your worries and work out possible solutions aloud. Your confidants may be able to offer advice from their own experiences or those of their friends. Not only does this provide emotional support, but it exposes you to different and potentially more productive ways of approaching and dealing with the situation.   In extreme cases, you should consider seeking the help of a professional therapist. You should certainly seek professional help if your financial crisis is causing you to struggle with depression, have anxiety attacks, or consider harming yourself or others.  Let your loved ones know that you are going through a financial crisis. You may be surprised who might offer you a loan, and even if your family is not in the position to provide you with financial assistance, letting them know what’s going on could result in significant stress relief.In many cases, it can be beneficial to let children know that the family is experiencing tough times. This is because some extracurricular activities (music lessons, summer camp) might have to be sacrificed for the good of the family. Just be sure to reiterate the temporary nature of these sacrifices. You can also encourage older teenagers to get part-time jobs. If they are over age 18, consider having them pay rent.  Before making a plan to remedy your situation, make a commitment to focus on the positive. Think about it this way: while the cause of your situation may not be in your control, how you choose to react to it is. Thinking positively can improve your mood, reduce your stress, and help you approach the situation in a way that is conducive to solving it.   Remember that regardless of your situation, others have faced and solved it before. Focus on being grateful for what you currently do have. For example, if you lost a job and have a large amount of debt, you could, perhaps, focus on support systems you have (like friends or family).  The first step to resolving a financial crisis is to get a clear picture of your entire financial situation. Begin by looking at your assets, which can be simply defined as what you own. Assets are a source of financial strength. They typically include any value you have in your home, cash in checking or savings accounts, any value you have in a car, and any money in retirement or investment accounts.   Assets can also include any other valuables that may be worth money like jewelry, collectibles. Consider taking your valuable assets to an appraiser or researching them online so that you can know how much your assets are really worth. That way, if you decide to sell them, you'll know if you're getting a good deal. Create a column on a piece of paper that lists these assets and their values. At the bottom, sum up the values to determine what the total value of your assets is. For more information, see how to make a list of personal assets.  Liabilities refer to your debt, or more simply "what you owe". They are the opposite of assets. Liabilities include credit card debt, lines of credit, mortgages, unpaid bills, student loans, and your car loan.   Using the same piece of paper you used for your list of assets, create a column that lists all your liabilities, and their values. At the bottom of the column, include the sum of your total liabilities.  Your net worth is simply your total assets minus your liabilities. This is the figure that represents how much is left if you were to sell all your assets to pay off your debt, and is a good figure to describe your current financial situation.   For example, if you have $10,000 in assets (perhaps in equity on your car) and $50,000 in various forms of debt, if you were to sell your car and used the proceeds to pay down your debt, you would have $40,000 in debt. Therefore, your net worth would be -$40,000. Knowing your net worth helps you understand options. For example, it may be necessary to sell assets in order to satisfy creditors if you are in debt, or to use any accumulated savings for the same purpose. Typically, any assets that are not absolutely essentially could be sold to satisfy essential debts. For example, selling a car to pay off a credit card can improve your credit rating, reduce your debt payments every month, and get creditors off your back. Even during a bankruptcy proceeding, creditors and courts may demand that you sell off certain unnecessary assets before your liabilities can be settled. Therefore, it's best to sell off these assets beforehand., Once you know your net worth, it is now necessary to look to your income and expenses. Knowing what these are can help you determine whether or not your net worth is shrinking or growing, and affects your path to recovery. Income is fairly simple to calculate by simply adding together any and all sources of revenue. For most people, this will be their wages from work and any regular government payments (like social security or other forms of assistance).   Remember to include necessary automatic deductions so that your income figure represents how much cash you actually have available to use. Deductions include any taxes, insurance, or withheld amounts on your paycheck.  In order to alleviate your financial crisis you need to have a good idea about where and how you spend your money. The best way to determine how much money you are spending is to review your bank account statements from the last two months. Make a list of how much money you spend on utilities, food, housing, gas, clothing and entertainment. Once you know where your money is going you can make adjustments geared towards decreasing the amount of money you spend so that you can get back on your feet., If you subtract your expenses from your income, the resulting number is your net income. This represents how much you have left over at the end of the month. If this number is negative, it is a sign that reducing your expenditures will need to be a critical component of your overall plan to restore your financial well-being.   However, if your monthly net income is negative because you are receiving a very small amount of income each month, it's more necessary to increase your income than cut your expenses.  In order to motivate yourself to get out of this financial crisis, you'll have to remind yourself why you want to improve your situation. In other words, what will you be unable to do because of your current situation? Be realistic about your life goals and calculate the costs of achieving those goals. Think about how just sitting back and settling into your new financial situation will hurt you and those around you in the long run.   For example, if you have children and want to one day give them the opportunity to go to college, think about how you will be unable to do so unless you turn around your current situation.  The exact nature of your recovery plan will have to remedy the problem that got you into the financial crisis in the first place. Put simply, you will have to reduce debt if you have it and earn more income to replace your lost assets and financial security. This may mean getting a new job, getting another job, cutting your expenses, applying for government assistance, or seeking debt forgiveness.   For example, if your financial crisis was caused by a divorce, you will have to find income to replace the joint income you had in marriage. The simplest way to dig yourself out of debt and live sustainably off of your income is to reduce expenses and increase your income. Other options, like bankruptcy, while necessary in some cases, can also ruin your credit and cause a large amount of hassle.  Fixed expenses refer to expenses that do not vary between months. Discretionary expenses refer to expenses that are not essential and vary from month to month. Knowing the difference is important, since reducing discretionary expenses can be much simpler than reducing fixed ones.   Your fixed monthly expenses are those bills and other costs that must be paid regularly so that your basic needs are met. Fixed monthly expenses include rent, mortgage payments, utilities, education, insurance, food, and transportation. Other fixed monthly expenses include any debt or other payment obligations.Variable or discretionary expenses include anything that you don't need to spend to survive, like eating out at restaurants, gym memberships, entertainment, and clothing.  The first place to start with reducing expenses is with your variable expenses. These are you wants, as opposed to your needs, and cutting them can free up significant room in your budget for debt repayments. Ensure that your not confusing your wants with your needs. For example, a cell phone may be a need, but a 3GB data plan with cell phone is almost certainly a want.Decide now that you won't go out to eat at a restaurant until your situation changes (for example, when you get a new job). This can save you a large amount on food costs. Watch for small purchases that add up, like buying coffee everyday. Eliminating these can save significant amounts of money each month. Cancel unnecessary memberships to fitness centers, clubs, and other monthly recurring-cost entertainment. Check to make sure that you don't incur more charges if you must break a contract early. Consider canceling cable TV. With the internet and smartphones, cable is often redundant. Don't shop unless you need to. You can probably postpone buying clothes for many, many months. If you must buy something, go to a second-hand store or to a close-out store.  Expenses like housing, food, or transportation are traditionally considered fixed, but that does not mean you can't significantly reduce your costs in these areas to free up space in your budget each month.If you are renting and your housing is too expensive, consider re-locating to a more affordable apartment, or to a different area of town. Keep in mind what you want, versus what you need. For example, if you are single, a one bedroom apartment may be ideal, but a studio is likely all you need, and downsizing can save you considerable amounts. Consider getting a roommate if possible. Consider visiting a food bank or soup kitchen, and using food stamps. If qualify, temporarily using these resources can significantly reduce your costs until you are in a better place financially.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), once known as the food stamps program, provides low-income Americans with supplemental funds to purchase food. Eligibility for SNAP is based on household monthly income, as well as other factors such as the number of children in a household. Contact your state’s government assistance program to learn about applying for SNAP.Ride share or take the bus to reduce transportation costs.  In a perfect world a 40 hours a week full-time job would provide you with the funds you need to cover your costs and expenses. In reality, you may need to get creative in order to locate additional sources of income, especially if you've fallen on hard times.If you don't already have a full-time job, immediately start going out to businesses that may be hiring and submit your application. Apply to as many places as possible. Find a part-time job. Search in craigslist and consult with friends in order to locate part-time job opportunities. Focusing on jobs that provide seasonal employment may be a great option in that seasonal employers often hire people only looking for short-term employment ie. working at the mall during the Christmas season, or as a lifeguard during the summer. Take on odd jobs like landscaping, baby-sitting, waiting tables, or bartending. Register at several temporary employment agencies. They might not have regular work or career-related work, but sometimes short assignments will help when you're in a pinch.  The U.S. federal government provides a wide range of services for American’s in need that are governed and dispensed by state governments. However, accessing government assistance programs requires patience because of varying application processes and bureaucratic delays. As a result, government assistance programs can provide additional funds for when you are going through a long-term financial crises, but you shouldn’t expect to receive quick financial aid from government assistance program.Unemployment insurance is a great option for those workers who are in a financial crises because they have lost their job, or are otherwise unable to work. An unemployment insurance claim can be filed if you fulfill specific requirements, which vary by state. Check with your local state department of social services to determine which other governmental assistance programs that you may be eligible to access. If you live outside of the United States, contact your local government to inquire about government assistance. Most developed countries offer unemployment assistance and subsidized necessities to those in need.  Any assets you don't absolutely need can and should be sold to pay off your debt. This is because the value of your assets is likely decreasing and the value of your debt is always increasing. The simplest thing you can do to improve your net worth is pay off as much of your debt as possible as quickly as possible.   If you are in a very dire debt situation, it can be a good idea to use retirement savings to pay off debt, or sell assets like a car. You can replace the car with a cheaper one or use public transportation instead, if possible. If using savings to pay off debt, it is important to consider a few things. Firstly, only use savings to pay off very high-interest debt (like credit card debt). Not only is paying off this debt with savings financially reasonable (due to the fact it is extremely costly and it is unlikely an equivalent amount of interest is being earned on savings), it can improve your credit rating, get creditors off your back, and reduce your monthly expenses. While planning your recovery, make a schedule of how much you can pay off each debt each month. This should also include when you estimate to be able to pay off each debt completely.  If you lack sufficient assets and income to pay for basic necessities and pay off your debt at the same time, filing for bankruptcy can be your only option. Bankruptcy can erase your debts and give you a financial clean slate, but is not without its downsides. The process also destroys your credit score and can force you to sell off certain assets deemed unnecessary, even if you don't want to.   Most people will file for what is known Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. This allows the court to settle your debts by selling off some of your assets. See how to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy for more information or see how to file Chapter 7 Bankruptcy without a lawyer if you want to file for bankruptcy by yourself. Protected assets are those that cannot be sold during bankruptcy proceedings. These typically include your primary residence, primary transportation, and personal items like wedding rings. Specific protected asset always vary by state., After you've decided on a recovery plan, whether that is getting a new job, reducing debts, bankruptcy, or some combination of those, get started as quickly as possible. The longer you delay, the more your debt will pile up. Take every step you decided on as quickly as possible.   Most of these will be abrupt changes that will negatively impact your quality of life. As states previously, the most important thing is to remain positive throughout this situation change and try to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  Understand that in a financial crisis situation, not all debt is valued equally. If after reducing expenses, you only have a fairly small amount remaining to pay off debt, it is important to use that amount to pay off debts in the following order of importance:   Pay off any secured loans first. These include mortgages or car payments. Not paying these loans can result in foreclosure or repossession. Focus next on unsecured loans, specifically on high-interest accounts like credit cards. Finally, focus on unsecured loans with low debt. For any debts you cannot afford to pay, ensure that you contact them and explain your situation. You may be able to renegotiate repayment in these cases.  While it may be tempting to ignore your creditors, this will only worsen your situation. Often, creditors will begin garnishing wages (automatically taking a cut of your pay) simply because they have not been able to make contact with borrowers .   Be aware that creditors will not stop attempting to contact you, nor will they forget about you. Therefore, being proactive and working with, rather than against creditors is critical. , Phone your creditors, and make sure you have with you all your financial information, as they will likely ask. Honestly explain to your creditors that you are unable to make payments, and that you would like to work with them to come upon a solution.Ask for a rate reduction, deferred payments for several months, or a reduced payment plan. Creditors are very eager to work with borrowers, since it is more costly for a creditor to utilize debt collection services and risk losing principle than to work constructively with a borrower. Suggest that you are willing to pay the ongoing interest during any period of debt relief, this signals to creditors that you are serious about your obligation Inform your creditors that you are planning on staying in touch every month. By contacting them and staying readily available, they will be more likely to extend favorable terms and be more flexible in their needs.  Both of these solutions involve transferring debt balances to new loans with more favorable termsA debt consolidation loan involves taking out a new loan with lower interest, like a line of credit, and transferring your higher interest debts to that loan. For example, you would transfer all your credit card debts to a line of credit, which rolls all of your payments into one payment, that will often cost less then the previous payments combined due to lower interest rates. Be aware that although interest rates are lower, the loan terms are often longer, which means you may actually spend more in interest over time. A balance transfer card is another solution for credit card debts. A balance transfer card is credit card which offers very low to no interest rates for the first 12-24 months for individuals who transfer their balances from another credit card. Doing this can give you a much needed break on payments until your financial situation is in order., If you feel overwhelmed, consider consulting not-for-profit debt counseling services. These services can help you make and plan and work with creditors to restructure your debt in a way that fits within your current means to pay.  As you begin to pay off debt and increase your income, you will begin to feel more financially secure again. However, this feeling can be quickly reversed if you get ahead of yourself and spend your newfound excess as quickly as you earn it. Make sure that even when you feel your financial health returning, you keep your spending low and don't incur any new debt until all of your old debts are repaid.   Consider allowing yourself one luxury each time you pay off a debt. For example, you might have cancelled your Netflix subscription to save money. You can set an allowance where you can renew your subscription once your credit card debt has been paid off. Allowance one luxury like this can help keep you on track.  If you ever had significant debt and were late on payments or went through bankruptcy proceedings, there is a good chance that your credit is very low. In order to secure your financial future, you will have to rebuild a good credit score. This will allow you to take on lower cost loans in the future. Even though unpaid debts or a bankruptcy can remain on your credit report for years, it is possible to begin building a good credit score once you get back on your feet.Build credit by paying off credit card in full and on time. This should be simpler now that you've reduced your discretionary spending. You can also build credit by paying back other loans on time and in the full amount. These include mortgage and car payments. Again, be sure to avoid taking out any new loans like these until you've paid off your old ones.  Examine the practices and situations that got you into the financial crisis that you've just struggled to climb out of. Were you living above your means? Were you often using expensive forms of debt to finance purchases? Perhaps you realize now that you can get by with spending much less than you did before, especially on discretionary expenses. Apply these experiences to your new financial situation to become even more financially sound than you were before.  If your financial crisis was due to an unavoidable cause, like a lost job or a medical emergency, you should take steps to be ready if it happens again. Once you're back on your feet with debts paid, be sure to save the money you have been using to pay off debts. Part of this saved money can be your "emergency fund." An ideal amount to save is enough to cover your fixed expenses for around six months. Having this money set aside will give you a financial buffer if you ever find yourself in a similar crisis.  

be aware that negative emotions are normal.  focus on accepting your financial situation.  talk about your situation.  be honest with your family.  commit to staying positive.  determine your assets.  determine your liabilities.  calculate your net worth.  determine your income.  determine your expenses.  determine your monthly net income.  assess the consequences of your situation.  create a plan suited to your needs.  determine your fixed and discretionary monthly expenses.  reduce your variable expenses.  reduce your fixed expenses.  pursue additional sources of income.  apply for government assistance programs.  consider selling assets and using the proceeds to pay off debt.  consider filing for bankruptcy.  implement your recovery plan.  prioritize your debt repayment.  understand the importance of staying in touch with your creditors.  contact your creditors and explain your situation in open and honest terms.  consider debt consolidation loans and/or balance transfer cards to reduce payment amounts.  consider debt counseling.  maintain your recovery habits.  rebuild your credit.  apply lessons you've learned.  save or prepare to prevent another crisis. 

 You do not have to become certified to work as an event planner. But having that designation could open doors for you and certainly puts you in touch with other professionals who value high standards in the field.   A certification is a professional designation given by a trade organization and can only be obtained after you have a proven track record of professional experience and have successfully passed the organization's tests.The most recognized certifications are those offered by the Certified Special Event Professional (CSEP) offered by ISES; the Certified Meeting Professional (CIC), and the Certified Meeting Planner (MPI).Each program varies in the level of professional experience required, so you'll need to contact the organizations individually to find out if you meet the requirements.    If you plan to specialize, look for specific trade organizations that focus on your area of expertise. For example, a wedding planner may want to check out a group such as the Association of Bridal Consultants and Weddings Beautiful Worldwide. If you are or have been a student in a recognized event planning course, ask about possible membership discounts, as memberships can be pricey when you're first starting out.  

apply for certification with reputable event planning associations.  consider membership in a relevant trade organization as well; the benefit of belonging to trade organizations is that you'll meet many contacts and find job opportunities through networking and resources only available to members.

 Freckles are a hereditary trait caused by an uneven distribution of skin pigmentation. A freckle occurs when there is a large concentration of the melanin pigment underneath one spot on your skin.Most natural freckles are small and essentially harmless. They tend to show up on areas exposed to sunlight, like your face, and these are probably the type you're longing for. They also range in color and may be tan, brown, black, yellow, or red. Sometimes freckles form as the result of sunburn. These are larger and often have irregular borders. While regular freckles usually fade after sunlight exposure decreases, sunburn freckles stay put.; , If there are no freckles in your genetic line, you will not be able to develop natural freckles. The people most likely to develop freckles are those with red hair and pale skin, but freckles are not exclusive to this set of characteristics. People with dark hair are less likely to have freckles, though it is still possible for them to have them. People with light hair and light colored eyes are also more likely to have freckles.   To determine if freckles are in your family line, look at your family. Siblings, parents, grandparents, and others who you are directly descended from are your best sources to consider, but extended family whom you are not directly descended from still share some genetic traits with you.  Freckles are drawn out with exposure to UV light. If you have natural freckles, spending a little time in bright sunlight might bring them out of hiding. Be careful, though - you should never stay out long enough to get a burn. Wearing sunscreen that's 20 to 30 SPF will still allow your skin to tan while protecting you from getting burned.   When UV rays hit the epidermis (the outermost layer of skin), it thickens slightly, causing the cells in your body to produce more pigment. As a result, the pigmentation of your freckles darkens, making them visible. If you would rather skip the sunbathing, consider exposing yourself to UV rays at a tanning salon. Follow the salon's recommendations concerning the amount of time to spend tanning, since tanning too much in a salon can lead to cancer.  Too much exposure to UV rays can be a major risk factor for skin cancer. Even though UV rays can seem like your best friend if you want freckles to form, they can have some very nasty side effects. As such, it is strongly recommended that you limit the amount of time you spend in the sun without sunblock or protective clothing.  

understand the cause.  determine if you might have the right genes.  spend a little time in the sun.  set a limit on your tanning. 

 Before you choose a dog food, you should consult with your vet. They will likely be able to recommend dry or canned dog food for your pet, and suggest how much food you should give your dog every meal. Your dog may also benefit from mixing the two types of food, depending on his health and dietary needs.Your vet may also recommend dry or canned dog food based on your dog’s age and breed.

 Breasts are made of fat tissue. Following a plan to lose body weight overall can successfully reduce the fat tissue in your body, helping to reduce the size of your bust. Many women even see a lot of initial fat reduction in their breast area.Adopt a cardio routine. Exercises like walking, cycling, or doing the elliptical machine are great for boosting metabolism and burning fat. Dancing, swimming, and kickboxing are other good cardio ideas. If it is comfortable to do so, try running and jogging. Just go for something that will get your heart rate up and get you moving. Shoot for a minimum of 45 minutes 5-6 days a week.Make sure to wear a correctly fitted sports bra when doing cardio exercises to protect your breasts. If you follow a regular exercise and diet plan and don't lose any weight in your breasts, you might have dense tissue instead of fatty tissue. Dense breast tissue cannot be burned off through diet and exercise., To help your weight loss and fat burning, make sure to eat a healthy, fat-burning diet. Foods good for burning fat are whole grains, lean protein, fruits and vegetables, and lots of water.Don't crash diet. Cutting calories too drastically slows metabolism, which can negatively impact your hard work. Shoot for at least 1200 calories a day, and remember to replenish your energy stores after working out.  Adding in muscle building exercises will help to tone and build chest muscles. These strength training exercises won't melt fat away in your chest area, but combined with cardio and a healthy eating plan, they will help you tone your chest area.   Try the following exercises: push ups, pull-ups, dips, pectoral flies, bench press, and upright rows. Strengthening your chest, back, and shoulders can help you if you have upper back pain, neck pain, stress on your shoulders, or poor posture due to your breasts.These exercises should be done 2-3 times a week. Start with 8-10 reps and increase from there. To tone, you want to use lighter weights and do a higher amount of repetitions. More weight with less reps will build bulkier muscle., Binding your breasts is helpful is you need to limit their movement, are dressing as a man, or otherwise need to flatten your chest. Chest binders safely flatten your breasts and can be purchased online and at certain retailers.   Never use ace bandages or duct tape to bind your breasts. They can cause serious side effects, like broken ribs and fluid build up.Always wear a binder that fits you. Never buy a binder that is too small to try to flatten your breasts more. That can also lead to serious side effects.  Breast reduction surgery removes fat, tissue, and skin to reduce the size of breasts to a size more comfortable or aesthetically pleasing to the patient.This procedure can be expensive and may be drastic for some women. If you are interested in breast reduction surgery, schedule a consultation with a plastic surgeon.  

lose weight.  eat a healthy, lower calorie diet.  do strength training exercises.  bind your breasts.  get a breast reduction. 

 Whether from cold, allergies, or infection, swelling will prevent Eustachian tubes from opening and allowing air to pass. This results in pressure changes, and sometimes, the accumulation of fluid in the ear. When this happens, you will feel the following symptoms:Ear pain or a feeling of "fullness" in the ear. Ringing or popping sounds and sensations that don't come from the outside environment. Children may describe popping as a “tickling” sensation.Trouble hearing clearly. Dizziness and trouble keeping balance. Symptoms might be heightened when you rapidly change altitude — for example when flying, riding an elevator, or hiking/driving through mountainous areas; , This very simple maneuver is known as the first technique of the Edmonds maneuver.Simply jut your jaw forward, then wriggle it back and forth, from side to side.If the ear blockage is mild, this action can pop your Eustachian tube open and reestablish normal air flow.  When you try to blow out through blocked passageways, the air pressure in your body is affected. The sudden rush of air when you release your breath can cause a rapid change in blood pressure and heart rate.Take a deep breath and hold it, closing your mouth and pinching your nostrils shut.Try to blow air out through your closed nostrils. If the maneuver is successful, you will hear a popping sound in your ears, and your symptoms will be relieved.  But instead of having the patient manipulate air pressure through breathing, it relies on the air pressure adjustment of swallowing. To perform this maneuver:Pinch your nose closed. Take a sip of water. Swallow. Repeat this process until you feel your ears pop and open back up.  It might look and feel silly, but this action, called the Otovent maneuver, can be effective for equalizing air pressure in your ears. Buy an “Otovent balloon” either online or at a medical supply store. This device is just a normal balloon that has a nozzle that fits into the nostril.If you have a nozzle around the house that will fit securely into the balloon opening and your nostril, you can make an Otovent balloon of your own at home.   Insert the nozzle into one nostril, and pinch the other nostril closed with your finger.Try to inflate the balloon using only your nostril, until it is about the size of a fist. Repeat the process on the other nostril. Repeat until you hear the “pop” of free air flow in the Eustachian canal.  Before swallowing, you have to build up air pressure in your body by bearing down like you’re trying to have a bowel movement. When you’re holding your breath and blocking your nose, it will feel like you’re trying to blow air out through all of your blocked orifices. Some people find it difficult to swallow under these circumstances because of the increased air pressure in the body. Be patient, though, and keep at it. With enough practice, it could pop your ears open.  This can both ease any pain you might experience and treat the blockage. The gentle heat of a warm compress can help break up congestion, unclogging the Eustachian tubes.If you use a heating pad, you should place a cloth between the heating pad and your skin to avoid burns.  Because the ears and nose are connected through tubes, a nasal spray is an effective way to treat Eustachian tube blockage. Angle the nasal spray bottle through the nostril toward the back of the throat, almost perpendicular to the face. Sniff as you spray the decongestant, hard enough to draw the fluid into the back of the throat, but not hard enough to swallow it or pull it into the mouth.   Try one of the equalizing maneuvers after using a nasal decongestant. They might be more effective at this time.  Talk to your doctor about whether this is a good option for you.   Note that antihistamines are usually not recommended for people with ear infections.  

recognize the symptoms.  wriggle your jaw.  perform the valsalva maneuver.this maneuver, which attempts to force air through the blocked passage and reestablish air flow, should always be performed gently.  try the toynbee maneuver.like the valsalva maneuver, the toynbee maneuver is intended to open blocked eustachian tubes.  blow up a balloon through your nose.  swallow with your nose pinched.this is called the lowery maneuver, and it’s a little harder than it sounds.  place a heating pad or warm washcloth against your ear.  use nasal decongestants.ear drops won't be able to unclog your congestion because the ear is blocked up.  take antihistamines if your problem is caused by allergies.while antihistamines aren't usually a primary method of eustachian blockage treatment, they may help alleviate the congestion from allergies. 

 The treatment consists of two phases: an iron reduction phase and a long-term maintenance phase.   Iron Reduction Phase: A phlebotomist or health care professional will remove close to one pint of whole blood. This is usually done once or twice a week. The treatment lasts until the extra iron in your body has been removed. This can take three months to one year - time varies from person to person. During this phase your doctor will also check your hemoglobin (a protein that is a found in red blood cells) and serum ferritin levels.  ; , How often one needs phlebotomy is based on the severity of the symptoms.  Treatments differ for men and women and the elderly.   Men most often need to have 3–4 US pints (1,000–2,000 ml) of blood taken out about once every 3 months. Women may require 1–2 US pints (470–950 ml) of blood be taken out once every 6 months. Older people may not need to have any more treatments, but they should still have their serum ferritin levels checked at least once a year.  

understand phlebotomy treatment.  know that after the extra iron has been removed, your doctor will set up a long-term maintenance program to make sure you keep a normal amount of iron in your body.  be aware that regular phlebotomy treatment keeps the amount of iron in your body at a normal level.

 The last thing you want is to be standing in half a duct tape dress and discover you're missing something. Then again, the looks at your local Walmart would be priceless...          Scissors Duct tape (1 to 1 1/2 rolls of 60-yd (55 m) tape for a size 10 figure) T-shirt Person to wear the T-shirt Marker  , Any color will do. The T-shirt will adhere to the duct tape and not be seen. And, as a result, wearing the duct tape dress is a lot more comfortable.  The T-shirt should extend to the desired length of the dress. Don't concern yourself with whether or not it's too baggy; length is all that matters.              If the T-shirt is not long enough, attach extra material (as haphazardly as you choose) to extend. This is the underside and does not have to be pretty.  Begin at the bottom edge of the T-shirt, starting at the back and wrapping around.  Use strips--it's easiest to have a tape-cutting helper. If you wrap it like a mummy, you're likely to curve absent-mindedly. Using strips creates linear angles.              Don't be worried about overlapping too much. Duct tape is one of the most versatile, miraculous things on the planet. If you mess up or create a hole, it can be easily fixed.              Wrap a little more loosely around the waist than you do the hips and thighs. At least initially--you'll be wrapping tighter later on.  Feel free to change directions; let your creativity flow.          Short pieces of tape capture the contours of the bust better. Arrange them so they radiate out from the center of the bust area.  When using a T-shirt as your pattern, it's easiest to make a sleeveless, high-necked duct tape dress, but feel free to deviate from this norm.  If you want a higher neck, use plastic wrap to protect the neck area and extend accordingly.  You'll be wanting to go a bit snugger this time.  Don't skip this part! Three layers ensure the durability of your dress.              It's a good idea to wrap horizontally, vertically, and then horizontally again.              If you're super-creative, take this to the next step and try weaving.  Have your guinea pig bend a little to make this easier to gauge.  Using a marker, make a line all around the natural waistline.              Use this line later when wearing and add a strip of duct tape for a cinched waist.  Or, heck, keep it on!          You can close the dress with additional tape, attach velcro or a zipper, or place it on a stand. Keep your hand between the T-shirt and the wrapped body to avoid cutting undergarments or flesh.  

assemble your materials.  put on an oversized t-shirt.  start wrapping the tape horizontally.  use shorter pieces arranged in a pattern around the bust.  cut the t-shirt to match your dress pattern.  wrap twice more.  mark the wearer's natural waistline.  cut down the center of the back for removal. 

 Being awkward around your peers and perfect strangers is difficult enough, but being awkward around someone you actually like can begin to feel impossible. Still, there are a few things you can do to have more social grace around your crush, and it starts with playing it cool and not acting like a puppy who is ready to hump the leg of anyone who comes by. Here are some ways to play it cool without looking too eager:   Smile and say hello, but don't go in for a hug unless you're at "hug" status with the person. If you're not sure, wait for the person to initiate the hug. If you see the person coming down the hall, approach him or her if you're nearby, but don't run to the other end of the building just to say hi or you'll look like a stalker. Don't nod too vigorously at everything the person says, thinking that it will just help you show your interest. Making meaningful replies is more effective than nodding. Avoid laughing at every little thing the person says -- especially if he or she isn't even trying to be funny.  To be less socially awkward, you have to be able to recognize the difference between a "creepy comment" and a "nice comment." Don't tell a girl, "You have such soft, fluffy hair. I just want to run my hands through it," unless you want her to slowly back away. Instead, say, "I like your haircut. It makes you look kind of like " The compliment should let the person see that you're paying attention without feeling like you're putting too much pressure on.   "You have a great smile" or "You have a great laugh" are usually safe bets. Complimenting a girl's dress or jewelry can make her feel special. Complimenting an aspect of the person's personality can work too; telling a guy he has a great sense of humor will make him feel good. Use your compliments sparingly. If you compliment the person every two seconds, he or she may get annoyed or even overwhelmed.  One socially awkward move is the "close talk," which is standing so close to a person that you're practically already trying to kiss him or her. You may be doing this just because you want to show interest, but standing inches away from a person and leaning in so far that the person keeps moving back will not endear you to your love interest.   Maintain a respectable distance and use your arms to gesture occasionally to make your conversation more dynamic. Make eye contact but look away every once in a while so you don't come off as too intense. Don't reach out to touch a girl's hair unless you're invited to. It's important to respect her personal space for her to remain comfortable with you.  Remember that the person you like may return your feelings and could be feeling a little awkward too. You should work on putting the person at ease by being friendly, laughing at something the person said if you know it was meant to be funny, and giving the person the reaction she wants from her statements. If she says something funny, laugh; if she's being serious, get the big grin off your face. Make the person feel like you're on the same level and that you won't be pulling any tricks.   If you're entertaining you love interest as a guest, make her feel more comfortable by offer her a drink, snacks, or a seat. Poking fun at yourself a bit will make the person feel more relaxed. If the person accidentally spills or drops something, just say, "That happens to me all the time."  , Since social awkwardness does have a lot to do with timing, you should not only know when you should enter a conversation, but you should also know when you should leave it. If you're talking to a person you like, you should get out of the conversation before you both run out of things to say, when you're still having an easy flow of conversation, so the person will want to keep talking to you next time.   And if the person makes it clear that you're not wanted by checking her watch or phone or looking around for her friends, then politely say goodbye. If you're not wanted, just say, "It's been fun talking to you" instead of, "Well, I know when I'm not wanted," which will only make things worse. And if you've had a good conversation, just say, "I look forward to catching up again soon" and leave with your head high.  

don't be too eager.  give meaningful compliments.  manage your body language.  put the person at ease.  know when to leave. 

 Make rest one of your top priorities in the weeks after you give birth. Sleep when your baby sleeps, and ask your partner or a family member to watch the baby now and then so you can rest.   New moms who don’t get enough sleep are more likely to have problems with their mental or emotional health., A nutritious diet can help keep your mood stable and prevent symptoms of PPD. Eat plenty of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and protein. Stay hydrated by drinking eight glasses of water every day. Avoid processed sugars and alcohol, which can cause mood swings.Many women opt to continue taking prenatal vitamins after giving birth, particularly if they are breastfeeding. Ask your doctor what kind of vitamins or supplements you should be taking.  Exercise boosts your endorphin levels, which improves your mood and helps balance your hormones. Try to get at least 30 minutes of gentle activity every day. Good options include taking your baby for a walk in the stroller, doing a few yoga poses, or easing back into a gym routine.Active moms have lower rates of postpartum depression than those who are sedentary.  Your new identity as a mom doesn’t mean you have to stop doing the things you enjoy. Carve out a little time on a daily or weekly basis to pursue your hobbies or to relax. You might have your partner, co-parent, or a close friend or family member come over and look after the baby for a few hours each week to get a little "me-time".   Use this time to care for yourself or do things you enjoy. Working on a creative project or catching up with a friend over coffee can lend some much-needed balance to your life. Other options may include activities like meditating, writing in a journal, or taking a soothing bath.Stock up a self-care box with soaps, bath bombs, your favorite nail polish, candles, art supplies, or an exciting book to use during your special time.  

catch up on sleep when you can.  eat well.  maintain an exercise routine.  make time for yourself to practice self-care. 

 When kids eat meals in front of the television or iPad, they are detached from the nourishment itself. Eating becomes something that is associated with entertainment instead and your child has no idea how much they are eating. Stop this habit and enjoy meals together at the table. Have polite conversation or listen to classical music while you eat.   Avoid snacking while watching TV, too. Aim to have all meals at the table without any source of entertainment present so they can tune into their bodies.Avoid providing snacks throughout the day. You may want to limit all forms of eating to specific times of day and only at a kitchen table.; , Before your family digs in at the dinner table, have everyone pause for a moment to appreciate the food being served. You might walk them through this process a few times at first. Then, do the exercise silently.   Think about where the food came from. The distance it had to travel to make it to your plate. Send out some gratitude to all the people involved in providing the meal before you (e.g. the farmers, the workers, the grocers, the cook, etc.) Spend some time admiring the many colors, textures, and smells associated with each meal. Activate your five senses to truly connect with the food in front of you., Kids may shove down food without thinking if parents don’t put appropriate practices in place. Encourage mindful eating by recommending that everyone return their forks to their plates after taking a bite. Take small bites. Chew each mouthful at least 20 times before swallowing., Instruct them to listen to their bodies. Kids should sit down to eat when they are actually hungry—not simply because others are eating or it’s a mealtime. Have them perform a hunger test.   For instance, if they are truly hungry, a real, whole food item should do the trick (i.e. meat and vegetables). If the hunger is for a specific junk food item, it may be emotional hunger, not physical hunger.To keep your kids on an appropriate eating schedule, limit excessive snacking between meals. Have them eat something approximately every 3 to 4 hours, but let them use their bodies as a guide. Sugar can be extremely addictive.If your child frequently craves sugar, you may want to wean them off of sugary foods. You may want to contact a therapist or doctor for help.  Emotional hunger typically arrives as a psychological craving in the head and doesn’t match hunger felt by a twinge in the stomach that develops between meals. Also, this type of hunger often appears due to situational cues like when you're in a high-stress environment, when you're facing a challenging problem, or when you're bored.Take time to investigate the causes behind your hunger before giving in to emotional cravings. If you recognize that situational factors are influencing your hunger, find adaptive ways to cope like exercising or calling a friend.  When your child starts looking for snacks, you should write down what their behavior or emotional state is at the time. You may find a behavioural pattern that causes them to seek comfort in food. If you can alter this pattern, you may be able to reduce the habit of eating emotionally.   For example, if you notice that your child wants to eat every time they are doing stressful homework, then you can take steps to teach them how to cope with stress at school.  

eat meals at the dinner table away from sources of entertainment.  appreciate the food.  put the fork down between bites.  check for hunger before eating.  know how to identify emotional eating.  monitor your child's eating habits. 

 In other words, be attentive to what the person in crisis has to say and maintain direct eye contact, as well as showing your willingness to talk about anything with that person, including their feelings about suicide.; , Seek to understand their situation without passing your judgement on them as this would only drive them away. Offer them the specific help that they wanted, despite them being dormant or closed-off.  Let them know that it's okay to be upset, and there's nothing wrong with them for having a hard time. This can help them feel cared about and understood. Use phrases like "I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with that" and "That must be hard."  , This falls under the category of exhibiting care for their well-being. This is because statistics has shown that 49.9% of U.S citizens committed suicide using a firearm and 26.7% uses suffocation as a means for suicide.In other words, people with suicidal tendencies are at a higher risk of committing suicide should they be exposed to harmful materials.   Offer to manage their medications. If they're willing, you can take their pill bottle and hide it somewhere. Then give them their daily dose, or give them a week's worth in a pill organizer. Lock up any firearms, and don't tell them the combination. Or, get rid of the firearm.  This falls under the category of showing that you care for them as a whole. If a person has expressed suicidal feelings has a plan, the means available and has a time set, you should always take them seriously and be sure to never leave them unattended.   If you absolutely must leave them alone for a while, make sure they are set up with something to do (e.g. a movie), ensure that they feel they're feeling okay enough to be left alone, and tell them when you'll be back to check in and say hi.  Stay with them or arrange for someone whom they trust to stay with them. It is important for them to stay in supportive circle of people that will always remind them that they are important, and give them the sense of belonging. Never let them to be alone and mulling about with their dark thoughts without support.  For example, if the person suddenly isolates themselves from the society, drops in academic performance, or constantly visits suicide promoting websites, these could be indicators of a problem. It is very important for you to keep a constant awareness and to always look out for their signs for a cry for help. Usually, the people with suicidal tendencies are reluctant to seek for help due to society stigma, so it is important for you to be the one who is in the lookout.  Help them think about positive things, such as how valuable they are to others, how their loss would be tremendous for the people around them and to look forward for the exciting events that is to come in life, and also help them to love themselves because there’s always a second chance, even for people who feel they've made mistakes in the past.  Because everyone makes mistakes in certain point of their life, it is good for you to reflect upon your past but it is never good for you to linger without remembering to take a step forward and create a new page for your life's story.  Get them close with people who have survived suicide acts so they can feel the sense of belonging and eventually they will feel positive and hopeful about life.  

start by being an “active listener”.  try to communicate about their problems.  validate their feelings.  hide harmful materials from their line of sight.  don't leave them alone to their thoughts.  always keep in touch with them.  look out for any warning signs.  give them hope.  convince them to forgive their past mistakes.  build a strong support system for them. 

 A notice or advertisement for a job may not require or prefer any age or age range for qualified applicants. The only exception to this rule occurs if the employer can show that age is a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ).An example of a BFOQ that would be allowable is an early retirement requirement for police officers and firefighters who are on active duty. Some courts, however, have limited the exception, so that a fire chief, for example, who does mostly administrative work, could not be forced to retire.; , The law does not prohibit employers from asking your age or birthdate as part of an interview. However, if the employer seems to focus on your age in the interview, and then you do not get hired, you may have evidence of age discrimination.Some topics in the interview that could provide evidence of age discrimination would be:   asking your age or birthdate focusing on the ages of your children commenting on the length of your marriage asking about the year of your graduation from high school or college  , Coworkers and employers may not harass someone in the workplace based on that person’s age. Prohibited behavior would include any derogatory comments, jokes, posted flyers that make age-related jokes, or any other activity that makes the employee uncomfortable.If you believe this type of behavior is occurring at your workplace, you should keep a journal of comments or keep photos or copies of any flyers or other materials.  It is a form of age discrimination to make training programs or apprenticeships available only to younger workers in similar positions. If you want to apply to a training program or apprenticeship program, and you get denied because of age, this is reportable as discriminatory., Approximately 30% of Americans over age 50 reported in a study that they experience age discrimination in health care. Although there is no law in the U.S. that explicitly prohibits this sort of discrimination, it can be very serious. Older adults are not included as much in clinical trials, so data for new medicines and new procedures may not accurately represent older people. Patients report that doctors seem less attentive to the special problems of aging bodies., It only takes a few minutes of watching television or viewing advertisements to recognize that marketers are focused on younger audiences. Most products aim for younger demographics. The few times that you will see older actors or actresses in commercials are for specific medical products.  Particularly in movies, lead roles are primarily written for or filled by younger actors. This is especially worse for female actors.Male actors seem to last a bit longer in the spotlight (Connery, Stallone, Ford), but by the time women reach the ages of 40 or even 30, they are already being passed over for younger actresses.  Any form of discrimination at work should be reported right away. If your company has a Human Resources director, you should speak with him or her as soon as you have concerns. If not, then you should speak with your immediate supervisor. If your employer is the individual who is committing the harassment, then you should contact local law enforcement or your state attorney general’s office. If the employer or human resources administrator does not take satisfactory action, you can then file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission., If you believe you have been the victim of age-based discrimination in rental or housing, you should seek out a local housing discrimination board to file a report. Such agencies exist to help tenants or prospective tenants resolve problems with landlords.   For example, in the state of Oregon, you may contact the Fair Housing Council of Oregon at (800) 424-3247.In Massachusetts, you would report to the Civil Rights Division at (617) 727-2200 or the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination.If you experienced housing discrimination by a federally subsidized housing project or federal housing program, then notify the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to file a complaint.  Places of public accommodation include hotels, restaurants, schools, offices, stores or other places that are generally open and serve the public. For most cases of age discrimination in places of public accommodation, you should contact your state Attorney General’s office. The Attorney General’s role is to enforce all laws within the state. Each state’s Attorney General may have a different subdivision dedicated to responding to discrimination claims, but the end result of all is to help protect your rights.   For example, the Attorney General of Arizona has a Civil Rights Division that accepts claims, as long as they are filed within 180 days.In Vermont, you can report claims of discrimination by places of public accommodation to the Vermont Human Rights Commission by calling (800) 416-2000., The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a branch of the federal U.S. government, is charged with investigating reports of discrimination in the workplace. The EEOC will receive reports, investigate the facts, and attempt to resolve any problems. The resolution may be helping the parties reach a compromise. The EEOC also has the power to impose fines against employers who commit serious infractions.The EEOC may also initiate litigation against employers for violations. Their jurisdiction includes actions against both private or public employers.  Under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, you must first file your claim with the EEOC. After that, however, you do have the right to file a private lawsuit against an employer for age discrimination. You must give the EEOC some time to undertake its own investigation first.   Your right to file a personal lawsuit begins 60 days after you file your initial complaint with the EEOC. After the EEOC conducts its investigation, it will issue you a “right to sue” letter. You must file your own lawsuit, if you wish, within 90 days after receiving that letter., Watch television and movies with a critical eye. Notice which shows or movies involve older characters and which ones focus only on the younger audience. Write to the producers and let them know your thoughts. When you see a story that involves an older character in a positive way, write directly to the producer or production company and praise them. When you see stories that completely ignore the older sector of the population, write and let the producers know that you want a change.  Advertisers want to sell their products. That's why they are in business. If advertising campaigns that focus on younger demographics bring about negative results, they may change their approach. Stop buying products that only advertise to younger audiences. Talk with friends and neighbors about doing the same. If enough people take action with their spending habits, the advertisers may begin to listen.  A quick search for #agediscrimination on Twitter brings up hundreds of messages from people commenting on this problem.Use outlets like Twitter and Facebook to gather support for your concerns against age discrimination.  The ADEA was passed in 1967. It protects individuals who are 40 or older from any discrimination in the workplace. It applies to both employees as well as applicants. The ADEA begins by stating its primary purpose:to promote employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age; to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment; to help employers and workers find ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of age on employment.  This federal law prohibits any discrimination in housing based on a number of factors, including age. The Federal Fair Housing Act was enacted in 1968 and then amended in 1988. Specifically, the Fair Housing Act prohibits the following forms of discrimination:advertisement for rental properties to younger age groups only falsely denying that a rental unit is unavailable setting restrictive standards or refusing to rent to certain groups terminating tenancy for a discriminatory reason  , Every state in the U.S. has adopted some state version of age discrimination laws. In many cases, these laws existed prior to the federal ADEA. Some state laws merely mirror the ADEA, while many provide additional protections.   You can find a useful summary of all 50 states’ anti-discrimination statutes in this handy document compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures, available at http://www.ncsl.org/documents/employ/Discrimination-Chart-2015.pdf. 

identify discriminatory job advertisements.  watch for improper interview questions.  spot age harassment in the workplace.  demand equal opportunities for apprenticeships or training.  watch for ageism in health care.  recognize age discrimination in advertising.  notice age discrimination in entertainment.  notify your human resources director if it happens at work.  contact a local or state housing board for age discrimination in rentals.  notify your state attorney general for age discrimination in places of public accommodation.  report employment age discrimination to the eeoc.  file your own lawsuit.  write to television and movie producers.  boycott products that discriminate.  use social media to put the word out.  read the age discrimination in employment act (adea).  become familiar with the federal fair housing act.  examine your own state’s age discrimination laws. 

 Some people think that if they ignore the mental illness, it will go away. No one in the family should ignore your husband’s bipolar. Your husband should not ignore his mental illness by refusing to accept it or getting treatment. You should not ignore it and pretend that your husband is okay. This can lead to problems later.If you have to, grieve for the fact that your husband has bipolar. Grieving may be part of the acceptance and coping process. Dealing with a bipolar husband can be difficult, so give your time to adjust to the new challenge in your life.  Though you may have to make adjustments and sacrifices because your husband has bipolar, that does not mean that your life should be only about your husband. You should not live for him. You should be your own person, with your own interests and your own life. Pursue hobbies, your career, and personal goals. Don’t sacrifice yourself.Remember that you are a human being who deserves a good life. You deserve to take care of yourself in addition to your husband. Having your life revolve only around your husband can cause a lot of problems for both of you.  When your husband deals with bipolar disorder, you may feel uncomfortable reaching out for support because you are afraid you and your husband will be judged. However, you should seek support from trusted family members or friends. Finding people you trust can help relieve the burden on both of your shoulders.If you don’t want to turn to people you know, you can try to find a support group in your community. This can provide a safe space for you to talk about being married to a bipolar husband without the fear of any negative response.  

refrain from ignoring the problem.  refrain from living your life for your husband.  find a support network.

 Best kind would be one of the stretchy ones so it doesn't look like the belt should go on pants. Belts definitely classy the dress and show off the good curves.; , A bright red can look overwhelming if you use it in every part of your outfit. Instead, use different shades of red to create contrast while staying within an all-red color scheme.  This shade is deep enough to mimic the classic look of black, but offers a subtle hint of color to your feet.  If you have a bold personality, opt for a bold shoe. Shiny patent leather adds a trace of shimmer to your foot, which may prevent your red shoe from being obscured by your red dress.  Think rubies or garnets. Gunmetal settings create a tough look, while silver and gold settings have classic appeal.  Post earrings, bracelets, and rings do not overlap with your dress and can be admired on their own. Necklaces and long dangle earrings may brush your dress, and the red stones may blend in with the red fabric.  Even though you can have an ensemble with multiple red pieces, you should still keep things toned down. A large red bag may wash you out with too much red. Instead, go for a small red clutch, especially one in a shade that varies from your dress.  Too many red accessories can confuse the eye. Restrict your jewelry to one or two small pieces, and avoid any accessory that looks unnecessarily large.  

bring in black belt.  mix in different shades of red.  try a burgundy red heel or flat.  keep things bright with a patent leather pump.  look for jewelry with red gemstones.  consider rings, earrings, and bracelets over necklaces.  carry a small purse.  keep your accessories subdued. 

 Overhead lighting allows for the best viewing, and it will help you see the surface characteristics of the gem. A neutral-colored background will allow you to differentiate between the different shades and intensities of blue. By minimizing the visual “noise,” you can focus on the gemstone.Despite popular belief, natural light is not always the best light to examine gemstones. Natural lighting varies greatly depending on geographic location and time of day.However, holding gemstones up to natural lighting is still a good supplementary view to get an idea of the gem's clarity.; , If you are going to be picking up the gemstone while examining it, it’s important to do so with tweezers. Using your fingers will cause smudging, which will certainly distract from the stone. Fingerprints will decrease the stone’s clarity and the color’s intensity.If you don't have tweezers on hand, try scooping the gem up with stiff card stock or something similar. If you absolutely must pick it up with your hand, grasp it carefully and touch as little of the stone as possible.  By examining the gemstone with a magnifying glass, you can see qualities of the stone not visible to the naked eye. This will help you look closer at the surface of the stone, noting all of the gemstone’s most intricate characteristics. Use the magnifying glass to really observe the intensity of color and ensure it is the stone you want.Inspect the tone and consistency of the color. Also look for internal flaws and inclusions. 

look at your gemstones in overhead lighting.  pick up the gemstone with tweezers.  use a magnifying glass.

 The best way to be prepared for your trip to the grocery store is to have a list of all the items you need to buy. That way, you know exactly what you need, can avoid impulse items, and won’t leave the store having forgotten something you need. To make a comprehensive list:Go through your cupboards to see what staples you're running low on. This could include flour, sugar, canned goods, rice, spices, tea, and coffee. Check your refrigerator to see if you need any fruits, vegetables, juice, or other beverages. Create a planned menu for the next week or two. Look over the recipes you'll be making and ensure you have all the necessary ingredients. Look through your storage closets and pantries to see if you need any bathroom or facial tissue, soaps, dish detergents, or other household goods.; , If you're looking to save a few dollars at the grocery store, look through store flyers or online for the items that are on sale for the week.   If you find coupons for any items on your list, clip them out or make a note of the brand that’s on sale. If you have a few grocery stores nearby, compare the prices of items listed in the flyers, and make lists of what items you intend to buy at each store to get the best price. To avoid spending extra money, only use coupons and flyers for items you were already going to buy., Because you may be buying a large quantity of food, it’s always best if you can take your own vehicle or get a ride to the grocery store. Otherwise, determine a route you can walk or bike, or find what public transit routes will get you to the store you wish to shop at.   Don’t forget to take your reusable shopping bags with you. If you're taking public transit or walking, consider using a rolling cart or large backpack that you can use to transport your groceries back from the store.  When you get to the grocery store, locate a shopping cart (if you need a lot of items) or a hand-basket (if you only need a few items). This will make your shopping experience much easier.   Shopping carts and baskets are often located near or just inside the doors.  If you brought reusable bags with you, don’t use them to carry your groceries: most stores prefer that you use the carts or hand-baskets.   Make sure you don’t crush smaller, delicate, or fresh produce items with larger items as you shop. If you're using a cart, use the upper section near the handle for delicate things like fruit and eggs.  The produce section is where you'll find all the fresh fruits and vegetables on your list, such as apples, oranges, bananas, lettuce, carrots, and other produce items.   While each fruit and vegetable has a different indicator of ripeness, you generally want to look for firm fruits and vegetables that aren't bruised, dented, or otherwise damaged.Try to buy fruits and vegetables in all colors to ensure you're getting the maximum vitamins and nutrients from your food. Remember that fresh produce won’t last as long as frozen, so only buy what you and your family will eat over the next week or so.  If you want to purchase fresh or specialty meat or seafood items, line up at the various counters. Wait your turn in line if there is one, and when it’s your turn, the person behind the counter will ask if you need help.   Don’t be afraid to ask questions about the products. You can even ask for samples if you aren't sure you'll like something.Remember that meat and seafood have short shelf lives if they aren't frozen, so only buy what you'll be able to eat.  The bakery section is where you'll find items like bread, buns, and baked desserts like pies and cookies. Depending on your grocery store, you may even find fresh pizza dough, bread crumbs, crackers, and other baked goods in this department.   Sometimes, bakery departments will bake their own bread, and these loaves are often uncut. If you want the loaf sliced, take it to the bakery counter and ask them to slice it. Many bakery departments also make fresh cakes that are baked to order, and you can have these customized and decorated for birthdays and other events. Talk to the people behind the bakery counter to find out what services they offer.  All your dried, canned, and baking goods will be located in the aisles in the center of the store. This includes pasta, rice, sugar, flour, spices, crackers, and cookies, plus canned beans, soups, sauces, vegetables, and other staples.   When buying canned goods, avoid cans that are dented, punctured, or bulging. Canned goods are great to have on hand, because they last much longer than fresh staples like produce, meat, and bread.These center aisles are also where you'll find household items such as toilet paper and dish soap.  In the freezers, you'll find frozen meat, prepared foods (such as burgers or meat pies), fruits and vegetables, and side dishes and snacks (such as ice cream and French fries). The refrigerators will hold dairy products, juices, prepared foods, packaged foods, and prepackaged meats.Frozen foods like fruits and vegetables that don’t have added ingredients (like salt or oil) are just as nutritious as fresh produce, and they are typically cheaper and will last longer. Just make sure you're going right home, otherwise your frozen items may start to melt!, Some grocery stores also have items available in bulk, and this could include spices, candy, snacks, dry goods like grains and pastas, and dried fruits and staples.   If you take any of these items, make sure you write down the bin number for each item. There will often be white twist ties you can use to seal your bags and write the bin numbers on. Look for pens located near the bags. When buying items in bulk, pay attention to the price per weight. Sometimes things will be price per gram, pound, or another unit of measure, and this can add up quickly. Some stores will have scales that you can use to weigh your produce or bulk items, and weighing your bags will give you an idea of the final cost of your bulk items.  These tend to be located in the very middle of the store, right in the center of all the healthy grocery staples. This is where you'll find pop, chips, candies, and other unhealthy snacks. If you can avoid going down these aisles, the junk food will be out of sight and out of mind, so you won’t be tempted to buy it.   While it’s ok to indulge once in a while, junk food is not part of a healthy meal plan, and these types of foods tend to be very pricey.  For convenience, checkout counters are usually located in between entrances or near exits. Each checkout counter will likely have a number above it, and if the number is lit up, that means the lane is open to use.   Most checkouts usually have express lanes that are reserved for customers who only have a few items. The express lanes will say how many items you can take through that lane. If you have more than the limit, use a regular checkout. If you're in a hurry and looking for the quickest line, look for the line with the fewest people, regardless of how many items each person has in their cart. Paying takes longer than ringing items through, so the more people have to pay, the longer checkout will take., Line up behind the last person in the checkout lane you’ve chosen, but make sure you don’t crowd them with your cart or basket. Move toward the conveyor as the line shortens.   When space frees up on the conveyor belt, grab a rubber divider from the side of the checkout and place it on the belt to divide your groceries from those of the person ahead of you. Start placing your items on the belt, but don’t crowd your food so that things get squished, bruised, or dented. More room will become available to you as the cashier rings through items ahead of you. Place large items and boxes on the belt first, and leave delicate items and fresh produce until the end so that it doesn’t get crushed., Usually, grocery store conveyor belts have an open section underneath at the end of the conveyor (farthest from the cashier) where you can leave your hand basket.   Once you’ve emptied all your items, place the basket here. If there are others there already, stack yours inside. If you're using a cart, however, push it through the line with you as you go.  If you brought your own bags, now’s the time to use them! Some grocery stores require the customers to bag their own groceries, and in others the cashier will provide this service. .   If the cashier is bagging the groceries, hand over your reusable bags. If you're bagging your own food, place larger items in the bottom and smaller and more delicate items on top. Separate raw meats from the rest of your food by putting them in their own dedicated bag. If you are buying eggs and loaves of bread, place the carton of eggs in the bottom of one of the bags and carefully place the bread on top. It's a good idea to put this bag in the "seat" of the cart so you know to place it in your car last in a safe place that won't have items placed or fallen on top of it. Make sure the cashier rings items through before you bag them.  When the cashier has rung through your last item, hand over any points cards you have that apply to that grocery store. This could include loyalty cards for that grocery store or other points you collect.   Tell the cashier how you intend to pay. This could include with cash, with a debit card, or with a credit card. Give the cashier enough to cover the bill if you're paying with cash, and don’t forget your change. Otherwise, complete the transaction on the machine.  If you're using a cart, you can place the full grocery bags back in the cart to get them to your vehicle. When you’ve paid, take your receipt and leave the store via the exit.   Place your groceries into your car if you have one, or find an out-of-the-way spot where you can pull over and put your groceries into your wheeling cart or backpack. When you're done, return the cart to one of the outdoor cart corrals located in the parking lot.  

make a list.  check flyers for sales and coupons.  get to the store.  grab a cart or hand basket.  place items in your cart or basket as you shop.  get fresh produce.  ask for help at the deli, butcher, and seafood counters.  get baked goods from the bakery section.  locate grocery items in the aisles.  stop by the freezers and refrigerated sections.  check out the bulk section.  try to avoid the junk food aisles.  locate the checkout counter.  place your items on the belt.  leave hand baskets under the conveyor.  provide your reusable bags.  provide any points cards and pay.  place your bags in the cart. 

 Most homes are equipped with conventional water heaters that store hot water in tanks. Water is constantly reheated as it cools down naturally. This is an inefficient process that leads to considerable costs, but there are a few steps you can take to improve your water heater’s efficiency. For instance, you will save 3-5% on your water heating costs for every 10°F (12°C) reduction in the tank’s standing water temperature.Since water heaters are usually set to 140°F (60°C), you’ll likely be saving a good amount just be taking this step. Don’t trust the heater’s thermostat. (Some won’t have numbers anyway.) Instead, carefully hold a thermometer beneath the faucet farthest from the water heater and turn the hot water on full blast. After a few seconds, read the thermometer. This will establish the tank’s temp. Go back to the hot water heater and check it's thermostat. If it’s accurate - great. If it’s not, write down the actual temperature next to a mark at the level shown. Using the temperature you found as a guide, turn down the water heater’s thermostat to whatever you think will bring the actual temp of the water’s tank down to 120°F (49°C). Wait two hours or more and take the water’s temperature at the faucet you tested earlier. It may take a few adjustments of the water heater’s thermostat to get the tank’s temperature to 120°F (49°C). Once you do, mark the water heater’s thermostat at the level that maintains this temperature.  Your water heater’s tank will gradually build up deposits. Fortunately, you don't have to drain the entire tank to keep these deposits from accumulating. Drain a quart of water from the tank every three months to keep the heater working at its peak efficiency.To do so, turn off the water running to the water heater, as well as the heater’s power. For gas units, set the burner on “pilot.” Connect a hose to the spigot at the tank’s base, and run the other end to a drain. Lift the pressure-relief valve on the tank and open the spigot. Take care not to let the water touch you or anyone else.  Make sure the pipes that hold your hot water are well insulated. This will keep the water several degrees warmer, preventing unnecessary reheating. You can use self-sealing sleeves that cost a few dollars each and can easily be slipped onto pipes.In particular, look for exposed pipes in your basement or crawlspace.  Many hot water heaters are equipped with a layer of insulation wrapped around the water heater’s tank. However, many older tanks did not include this feature. If your tank does not have insulation on it, or is rated with an R-value lower than 24, wrap it in an insulation blanket and seal it with heat-resistant tape.A roughly $20 insulation blanket can easily be installed and will reduce heat loss from the tank by as much as 45%. This can save you as much as 9% on your water-heating costs.  Do not cover the top and the bottom of the water heater. Further, take care not to block a thermostat, or the air inlet/exhaust on a gas unit. See the manufacturer’s warning for specific locations.Do not insulate a unit that already has insulation on it. This will not improve the unit’s efficiency.  Timers can turn off your water heater at night, or any other time you know hot water won’t be needed in your home. Some places also charge more during periods of peak demand, and you can set the timer to turn off for this period to save money as well. 

turn your tank’s thermostat to 120°f (49°c).  drain the tank’s sediment.  insulate hot water pipes.  insulate the water tank itself.  attach the material as close to the tank’s surface as you can.  install a timer on your water heater. 

 Vodka sauce is traditionally served with penne or rigatoni pasta, though you can use it to top any type of pasta that you like. As you start to prepare the sauce, bring a pot of water to boil on the stove to cook your pasta.Be careful not to overcook your pasta. Test it a minute or two before the instructions say it will be done to see if the texture is right. It should be slightly firm when you taste it because it will continue to cook while you drain it and in the sauce. You don’t necessarily have to use vodka sauce on pasta. It can make a delicious sauce for pizza, chicken, and fish too.; , Set a large skillet or saute pan on the stove, and set the burner to medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of olive oil and 2 tablespoons (30 g) of butter, and heat until the butter is completely melted.While the combination of butter and olive oil offers the best flavor for the dish, you can use 4 tablespoons (120 g) of butter by itself or 4 tablespoons (120 mL) of olive oil by itself if you don’t have the other ingredient on hand. You can tell that the oil and butter are at the right temperature when the mixture goes from completely smooth to rippled in the pan.  When the butter and olive oil is properly heated, add 1 cup (approximately 1 medium onion or 150 g) finely chopped onion 2 to 3 cloves of chopped garlic to the pan. Allow the garlic and onion to cook for approximately 5 minutes, or until the onion becomes soft and slightly brown.Stir the onion and garlic as they cook to ensure that they’re well combined. Watch the pan carefully to ensure that the onion and garlic don’t burn.  Once the onion and garlic have cooked for several minutes, remove the pan from the heat and carefully pour in ¾ of cup (180 mL) of vodka before returning it to the stove. Stir it into the onion and garlic, and allow the contents to cook for 2 to 3 minutes so the vodka can start to reduce.If you would like a sharper flavor to your sauce, you can add up to 1 cup (240 mL) of vodka. You may want to experiment to see what amount you like best. To reduce the risk of fire, don't pour the vodka directly from the bottle into the pan. Instead, pour it in a measuring cup first and then add it to the pan from the cup. Make sure to have a lid for your pan nearby when you add the vodka. If it ignites, immediately place the lid on the pan to smother and kill the flames.  When the vodka, onion, and garlic mixture has cooked for a few minutes, it’s time to add the tomato puree to the sauce. Pour one can of puree, approximately 14 ounces (397 g), into the skillet, and stir until all of the contents are thoroughly combined. Reduce the burner’s heat to low.You can swap the tomato puree for a can of tomato sauce, but you’ll wind up with a slightly thinner sauce.  When the tomato puree is completely mixed with the vodka, onion, and garlic, add 1 cup (240 mL) of heavy cream to the pan. Stir carefully to ensure that it’s fully incorporated into the sauce. Instead of the bright red of the tomato puree, the sauce will now have a creamy light orange color.Make sure that your burner it turned to low. You can burn the sauce very easily at this point. The sauce requires heavy cream to give it the right consistency. Avoid replacing it with whole milk or half-and-half if possible.  When the cream has been completely stirred into the pan, it’s time to season the sauce. Mix in ¼ to ½ (1.25 to 2.5 g) teaspoon of salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste. Add a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes too to give the sauce a little heat.Use as much or as little crushed red pepper as you like. If you aren’t a fan of spicy foods, you can omit it entirely.  If you’ve made pasta to serve with the sauce, make sure to save a cup of the water that you cooked it in just before you drain it. That way, you can use the water to thin the sauce if it turns out to be too thick when you combine it with the pasta.Add just enough pasta water to make the sauce and pasta combination easy to stir together.  Turn off the burner that the vodka sauce is on, and drain your pasta. Place the hot pasta directly into the pan with sauce and then toss the together to ensure that the pasta is evenly coated.Don’t put all of your cooked pasta into the sauce at once. Instead, add approximately ½ to ¾ and make sure that there is enough sauce to coat all of it. If there’s excess sauce, finish adding the rest of your pasta. You should have enough sauce for approximately six servings of pasta.  When the vodka sauce and pasta are fully combined, mix in 1 cup (450 g) of grated Parmesan cheese. For serving, you can top the pasta and sauce with a little more grated cheese.You can also garnish your pasta and vodka sauce with some fresh basil leaves for added color.  While pasta and vodka sauce is a common dish, you can customize the recipe to suit your tastes. You may want to add some type of protein to the dish to make a hearty meal, or mix in some vegetables for added flavor.   Grilled chicken, sausage, and shrimp can be tasty addition to your pasta and vodka sauce. Cook approximately 1 pound (450 g) of your chosen meat or seafood fully, and then top each bowl of pasta and sauce with it. You may want to drizzle additional vodka sauce over the protein. Peas pair well with vodka sauce. When the sauce is nearly finished, add 1 cup (150 g) fresh or defrosted peas to heat them through.  

cook some pasta according to package directions.  heat the butter and olive oil in a skillet.  saute the onion and garlic in the pan.  add the vodka to the skillet.  stir the tomato puree into the pan.  mix the cream into the sauce.  season the sauce with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes.  save some pasta water to thin the sauce.  add your pasta to the sauce.  stir the parmesan cheese into the dish.  customize your recipe.

 Being in a bad mood is not that bad! Trying to force yourself to cheer up is much, much worse. Fighting bad moods only prolongs them, so if you’re mad or sad, be mad or sad. This does not allow rudeness and unpleasantness to innocents, it just means you need to recognize and accept your mood in order to be able to do something about it.; , Others will notice if you try keeping your bad mood secret with a happy mask and will wonder if they ticked you off. Tell them you are not having a good day. Simply say, "Listen, I’m in a really sour mood today. I’m not sure why, but it’s nothing you've done. If I do bite your head off, I'm apologizing in advance."  , Successful people aren't always the smartest, but have acquired emotional skills, and rely on being able to recognize and to deal with one's own emotions. We tend to think that a bad mood is always caused by something or someone else (like trying to deal with a difficult boss). Bad moods aren't always connected to obvious, external factors. Perhaps you just slept poorly, are getting the flu, or are just having a bad day. Don't try to justify a bad mood. Instead, try to look inside yourself first, in order to ascertain possible precursors to your emotional state.  When you’re in a foul mood, everything is bad. But the good things you appreciated yesterday, when you weren't as annoyed, should be there - you just forgot them. Spend time considering at least one or two things that aren't all bad (something you look forward to, a person you like, something nice that happened recently) and be thankful for that.  It passed, so will this. It’s no big deal. If you can't shake the mood, simply wait it out.  To avoid doing or saying something you might regret, withdraw a little if you can. Walk during your lunch break, sit and work someplace quiet. Take a long bathroom break. Consider going home early, or taking the day off.  Why wait until tomorrow to start your day over. Do it now. Leave your desk, or where ever - leave - decide to start over, as if you slept. Return to work with a fresh attitude. This really works, more so with practice.  Once the bad mood wear off, and you feel better, figure out what helped: was it a thought? a song? a friend? an event? When the next "red zone" comes, you will have developed an array of techniques to pull yourself out.  

accept your bad mood.  tell others.  look inside first.  remember the good stuff.  let it pass.. you’ve been in a bad mood before.  take some quiet time.  start your day over.  leverage your next good mood. 

 Direct intuition, also called literal intuition, is the sort of intuition you harness when you ask yourself about a specific situation.Make yourself comfortable. Sit down in a quiet place and focus your breathing until your body relaxes. Identify a situation you would like insight on. Focus on this situation for several minutes. Ask aloud or in your mind for a direct intuitive experience about it in the near future. Let it go. You may need to do this multiple times before anything comes of it, but by focusing your energy on one specific situation, your intuition is more likely to pick up on cues for that situation than on anything else.; , Indirect intuition, also called symbolic intuition, focuses on the mind's natural ability to pick up on things of key importance by developing your ability to see in and interpret mental symbols.   Grab a pencil and a piece of paper. Ask yourself, "What does my life need right now?" Repeat this question three times, pausing in between each repetition while imagining yourself moving to a more meaningful answer each time. After asking the question three times, pick up your pencil and draw the first symbol that comes to mind. Interpret the symbol. Figure out what it represents from your perspective and how that concept plays into your life.  The human mind enters the REM stage of sleep every 90 minutes, and during this state, the mind dreams. Dreams can be a powerful tool in your journey to interpret cues from external stimuli that your subconscious has already analyzed.Before going to sleep, put a pad of paper and a pen next to your bed. Ask yourself a question or focus on a specific situation in your life that you need an intuitive answer to. Repeat it as often as possible before falling asleep. When you wake up, write down anything you dreamed about. If you did not dream about anything, write or draw whatever enters your mind. Repeat as needed until you get an answer to your question or situation.  Blind readings use a system of cards to help you focus your energy and subconsciously answer questions using your intuition.Sit down at a desk with three blank cards. Think about a question or situation you need your intuition to help you with. Write three different solutions to that question, assigning one to each card. Flip the cards over so that the answers face down. Shuffle them and place them face-down on the desk. Run your hands over the cards. Take your time, relax, and breathe deeply. Flip the cards over. The card you felt most drawn to should be the correct solution.  Most instructors who teach psychic development will say that the biggest obstacle you need to overcome when becoming clairvoyant is the fear you have regarding the ability to see the future.   Identify the source of your fear. Oftentimes, your fear may be as simple as worrying about how silly you look, but sometimes, you might have a frightening image at a young age and turn off your clairvoyant abilities in response. Get rid of your fear by chanting an affirmative phrase silently or out loud. Try a phrase like, "I am willing to release all fear of seeing my future."  , Before you can use clairvoyance to answer direct, specific questions, you may need to increase your ability to see vivid images in your mind. You can do this with a simple visualization exercise.   Imagine yourself holding seven balloons. Each balloon should be a different color. Let the balloons go one by one. Watch each one float up to the blue sky until they disappear before releasing the next balloon and visualizing the same thing.Practice until you can clearly see each balloon complete its journey.  When the time comes to use your clairvoyance on a particular question, make sure to phrase your question in a very specific manner so that you can really address the heart of the matter.   Stay away from a broad question like, "Will I enjoy my birthday this year?" In this instance, think about what you actually want your birthday to be like, and ask yourself a more specific question like, "Will any of my friends or family take me out to do something special for my birthday this year?"  , After asking your question, breathe deeply three times. Focus on the area between your eyes. This spot is a chakra known as a "third eye," which psychics claim to be responsible for visual clairvoyance abilities.   Continue breathing while fixing your attention on this area. Vividly imagine an illuminated horizontal oval shape in the center of your forehead. This is your "third eye." Ask it to open, repeating the request until it does and you feel a warm feeling rush through your body.  Let the images come into your mind naturally. Do not force them. If they seem fuzzy or unclear, tell them, aloud or silently, to grow in size and strength right away.   Clairvoyant images will usually come as a picture inside your mind's eye, a picture seen outside of the mind's eye, a movie inside your head, or a movie outside your head. The images may be black and white or full color. Moreover, they many appear life-like or cartoonish. If you cannot figure out what your clairvoyant images mean, ask aloud or silently, "What do these pictures mean?" You should receive an answer as a feeling, thought, or sound. If this does not work, repeat the exercise until some answer does come. When you just start out, the answer may seem hazy and uncertain, but it is important that you trust yourself no matter what.  When people think of psychic abilities and predicting the future, they often think only of clairvoyance. Clairvoyance is the practice of future “sight,” but there are other senses you can use to anticipate the future.   Clairaudience is the ability to "hear" psychic energy. Clairsentience is the ability to "feel" energy. Common forms of clairsentience include gut feelings and empathy. Claircognizance is the ability to "know" things without being told. If you ever had a grandmother or aunt who knew whenever anyone was sick at your house without being told about it first, she would have possessed claircognizant abilities.  To develop clairaudience, you need to learn how to fine-tune your sensitivity to the sounds around you and inside you.When lying in bed at night, consciously listen to the noises you usually tune out. Separate and identify each one. Pick out as many as possible before falling asleep, and do this for about a week. Listen for clairaudient guidance. Picture yourself turning on a radio and tuning to your clairaudient channel. Start asking questions, and listen for any words you get in response. These words may be soft or loud, sensible or confusing, but once you hear a response, you need to analyze what it means.  One of the most beneficial ways to develop clairsentience is to work on reading the energy and feelings of someone else. You can practice this in several ways.Ask a friend to show you a picture of someone you do not know but whom he or she knows well. Look at the eyes of the person in the picture and try to determine how that person felt at the time the photo was taken. Also ask yourself if this person is trustworthy, and if there is anything else that stands out. Check with your friend to determine how accurate your senses were. Ask a friend to give you an object belonging to someone you do not know but whom he or she knows well. This object should be something the person has worn regularly, since these objects are more likely to absorb more energy. Hold the object in your hands and gauge whether there more positive or negative energy has soaked into it.  Developing your claircognizance is a lot like developing your intuition. You will need to focus on exercises that help you organize your thoughts and understandings, like automatic writing.Sit down with a pen and paper. Ask yourself a question and write down whatever pops into your mind in response, even if it seems like unrelated nonsense. Force your mind to be a spectator in this exercise. Do not let your mind think about the information you get or try to direct it. Simply write your thoughts as they roll out until they cease to come. Read over what you wrote. If anything jumps out at you, highlight it and analyze it after you finish reading your entire thought process.  Whether you are trying to develop intuition, clairvoyance, clairaudience, clairsentience, or claircognizance, tracking your psychic experiences in a journal can help you develop your abilities further.   Keeping a journal helps you understand your strongest psychic and intuitive abilities. It also lets you check for accuracy and assess how valuable your responses tend to be., Even if no one among your friends and relatives is working on developing clairvoyance, you should have at least one person whom you can openly express your thoughts to. Sharing your experiences can help sharpen your understanding of them.   Share entries from your intuition journal and discuss your interpretations. Discuss similar experiences your intuition buddy has had and help him or her analyze any dream or experience that has remained a mystery to him or her.  

work with direct intuition.  work on your indirect intuition.  listen to your dreams.  try a blind reading.  release your fears.  increase your visual imagination.  form a specific question.  open your third eye.  let pictures come to you naturally.  know the difference between each type.  develop clairaudience by focusing sound in your imagination.  work on clairsentience by focusing on another's energy.  develop claircognizance with automatic writing exercises.  keep a journal.  find an intuition buddy. 

 Any kind of plastic baggie will do, though a hearty baggie will has less of a risk of splitting and spilling stuffing. You can use many different kinds of material for stuffing, like beans, rice, or popcorn kernels, to name a few. About ½ cup of stuffing will yield a bean bag about the size of an adult fist, which is a great size for young children.   Larger baggies will be able to fit more stuffing, but if the stuffing is heavy, it may cause the bag to burst or burst more easily. The no frills no sew bean bag will be reinforced with a layer of durable tape, making this one of the sturdier varieties of no sew bag., If the baggie has a seal, close this now. After that, hold the baggie so the stuffing collects in a corner of the baggie. Then tie a simple knot above the stuffing, so it isn't packed too tight or too loose.You can gather your stuffing together and fold excess parts of the baggie to form many shapes with your no frills bean bag., If you don't cover the plastic baggie, over time the plastic will wear down and it will break. This will cause stuffing to go everywhere, but you can help prevent this from happening by using a durable tape, like duct tape or electrical tape, to completely cover the outside of your no frills no sew bean bag.Other kinds of tape can also work to form a protective barrier for your plastic baggie. However, the more durable the tape, the more durable the barrier will be. Some tapes may form a stiff barrier on the outside of your bean bag that is not suitable for very young children, although this bean bag should be soft enough for most grade school children.  Many kinds of tape are easy to draw on, so why not break out some markers and give your no frills no sew bean bag some color? You could also personalize your bean bags by painting each one, or by adding stickers. 

add stuffing to a plastic baggie.  seal and tie off the baggie.  create a protective barrier with tape.  decorate and enjoy your bean bag. 

 Bright lights can upset the body's release of melatonin, which tells you when it's time to go to bed (and helps you fall asleep).Adjusting your exposure to light in the hours before sleep will help you fall asleep easier and get a better night's sleep.   Dim your lights an hour before getting ready for bed. Invest in a dimmer if you haven't already. Dim lights will help your body start producing melatonin, giving you a better chance of falling sleep early. Turn off bright computer monitors and TV screens after 8. If you have trouble getting to sleep early on in the night, bright computer monitors and TV screens are your enemy. If you have to be connected, try to dim the lights on the computer so that your overall exposure to light is less.  Waiting for your alarm clock to hit a certain time — and stressing about how late it's getting — may actually keep you from getting a restful sleep. It seems like the harder you try to fall asleep, the harder it is to actually do.The solution: turn your alarm clock so that it's facing away from you. Or even better: place your alarm clock on the other side of the room so that you can't see it and you have to get out of bed in order to turn it off in the morning.  For those who like to snuggle with their partner at night, the results may seem alarming: researchers found that people who sleep in the same bed as their partners woke up during the night, experienced major disturbances, and got less restful sleep.If you suffer from chronic fatigue, talk with your partner about sleeping alone at least a couple nights per week.   Don't invite your pet in on the sleepover. A study by Mayo Clinic Sleep Disorders Center found that 53% of pet owners who slept with their pets experienced a major sleep disturbance during the night., People who have an alcoholic beverage before bed have a higher likelihood of waking up in the middle of the night when the body finishes processing the alcohol, studies say.When you're sober, your parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) lowers your heart rate, giving you a restful sleep. When your body is processing alcohol, your sympathetic nervous system never gives up the reigns to the PNS, leaving you more tired than you would have been had you fallen asleep naturally.  If, after 15 minutes of trying to go to sleep, you find that you can't, get out of bed and read, write, or find another soothing activity. (Remember, no bright lights or TV screens!) Not being able to go to sleep, and trying really hard to do so, can produce stress, which will ultimately keep you awake longer. Finish your activity and then try to go to sleep again.  Cool environments help the body get better sleep. That's because cool temperatures help bring on the drop in core temperature that signals sleepiness.   What's the ideal temperature at which to fall asleep? Scientists say that a relatively cool temperature of between 60 and 68 degrees is optimal for getting to sleep.Studies have found that insomniacs have higher core temperatures right before they get into bed.If you're having trouble getting to sleep, try dropping the temperature pretty low and putting a hot water bottle in between your feet.A hot water bottle will rapidly dilate blood vessels, which can help regulate the body's internal temperature.  

turn off the bright lights and tv screens after 8.  don't keep looking at your alarm clock.  consider sleeping alone.  don't have that drink before bed.  if you can't fall asleep, stop trying.  sleep with the temperature down. 

 The best bag for this is a thin, cheap, trashcan liner. It should be translucent or clear. Do not use a regular trash bag; it will be too heavy. You can also use a dry cleaning bag instead. If you do, make sure that it is the short kind used for shirts; be sure to tape the hole at the top of the bag.   Do not use plastic grocery bags. They are too small and too heavy.; , Place the opening of the bag in front of a small fan. Make sure that there are no gaps. Turn the fan on. The bag should fill up like a balloon. If it does not fill up, it may have some holes. Find these holes and cover them with a piece of scotch tape., The day should be cool; the balloon will not fly well on a hot day.Make sure that there is no wind; even the slightest breeze will keep the balloon from flying. The best time to fly would be at dawn or dusk as the weather is the most still.Cold, winter days with high pressure are the best for flying.  You can also fly your balloon inside. Make sure that there is a lot of space, and that there are no curtains or carpets inside. If the balloon lands close to one of those, you could start a fire. A great place to fly is in a garage or a school gym.  You will be working with fire, so you want to be safe. If you are a child, make sure that you have an adult with you at all times.  The edges will be sharp, so be careful.  Each dot should be 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from each corner. You will be placing your candles on these dots.  This will make the balloon lighter and easier to fly.  You may have noticed that two of the candle pieces still have the wick sticking out, and two do not. Using your fingernail, crumble the tip of those two candles until you have some wick showing. You want to end up with four mini birthday candles.  Use a lighter to melt the bottom of a candle. Let some of the wax drip onto the dot. Once you have a small pool of wax, stick the candle down onto it. Hold the candle still until the wax hardens. Do this for the other three candles.          If you are a child, ask an adult to help you with this step.  Be careful not to bump the candles while you are doing this. They will pop off easily. This will help catch any melted or dripping wax from the candles.  Lay a ruler across the opening of the bag. Write down the length. This will be how long you will be making the sticks for the frame.  To connect two straws together, cut a small slit into the bottom of a straw. Side the cut part into another straw. Wrap a piece of tape around the joint. Keep doing this until the stick is the same width as the bag.          If you are using bendable straws, cut the bendy part off., Find the middle of one stick. Place the other stick on top of it.  Do not use too much tape, or the frame will be too heavy. The best tape to use is clear scotch tape. Masking tape will be too heavy.  Purchase some thin balsa wood sticks from an arts and crafts store. They look like squares or rectangles when you look down at them from the top. Cut the sticks down to the right length. Put a drop of wood glue in the middle of one stick. Place the other stick on top of it, making a cross or X shape. Wait for the glue to dry.   Try to get the thinnest stick possible. It will be the lightest and easiest to fly. Do not buy dowels; those are not balsa wood and will be too heavy.  If you look down on the frame and tray, the candles should be between the straws. This is very important. If the candles are over the straws, the heat will burn and melt the straws. It will also distribute the weight the wrong way.  Take a piece of tape and put it under one of the arms of the X. Press the tape against the bottom of the tray. Do this for the other three arms and sides of the tray.  Tape one corner of the bag to one of the ends of the frame. Tape the opposite corner of the bag to the other end of the frame. Do this for the other two sides. You are making a square-shaped hole.  You can also tie the string to a table, chair, or fence. This is very important. If you do not do this, the balloon may fly out of reach and get caught. Choose a thin, light string, such as thread.  Try to keep the bag as loose as possible, It might be easier to do this step and the next step with a friend.  Be careful so that you do not knock or push any of the candles over or burn the bag. A long, stick lighter might work best for this step. If you are a child, ask an adult to light the candles for you.  This will take about a minute or so., It will not fly at first, but after a few more moments, it will start to rise on its own. Be sure to keep holding onto the string, or attach the string to something. The balloon will float for as long as the candles are lit.         

find a thin, plastic bag.  make sure that the bag does not have any holes by putting it in front of a small fan.  check the weather if you are planning on flying outside.  choose a large, empty room if you are planning on flying inside.  keep a bucket of water or a fire extinguisher near by.  cut a 4 inch (10 centimeter) square from a sheet of aluminum foil.this will be your basket.  make four dots inside the square using a marker.  take two birthday candles and cut them in half.  peel the wax away on two of the candles to expose the wick.  melt the bottom of each candle and stick it onto a dot.  fold up the edges of the square by ¼ to ½ inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters) to make a basket.  measure across the bag's opening.  make two sticks out of straws according to that length.  make a cross or x out of the two sticks.  tape the two sticks together.  consider using balsa wood sticks instead.  put the candle tray on top of the straw frame.  secure the tray to the frame with tape.  tape the opening of the bag to the frame.  attach a long piece of string to the frame and hold onto the string.  place the balloon on a flat surface and hold the bag up over the candles.  light the candles.  keep holding the bag until it fills up and stands on its own.  let go of the bag. 

 Most companies have specific guidelines about harassment, discrimination, and inappropriate workplace behavior and etiquette. It’s a good idea to review these policies so that you can evaluate whether they are being followed.  Review employee handbooks or training manuals to see if your employer provides specific instructions for addressing workplace grievances. If these are in place, document your efforts to conform to these procedures.   Evidence that you followed these instructions strengthens your case in the event that you have to seek the help of higher-up employees or outside assistance.  If you have to address the issue of a hostile workplace environment with supervisors, human resources, union representatives, or attorneys, you will need to provide specific evidence to support your concerns.Save relevant emails and written correspondence. Take notes during meetings and phone conversations. Keep a log or diary detailing the date, time, and circumstance of specific encounters or incidents. Work with other affected or involved employees to draft statements and reports detailing grievances or incidents that occur. Keep the records you collect in a secure place where coworkers or supervisors won’t have access.  Don’t be afraid to ask for help from a colleague, a supervisor, or a member of human resources. They can provide valuable information and advice on how to improve the workplace environment.   Coworkers you approach might feel the same way, and talking with them about the situation will help everyone feel less alone. While it might feel daunting to contact supervisors and human resources staff about a hostile work environment, it's their responsibility to address employee concerns and resolve problems that have a negative impact on employee productivity and the work environment.  

research company policies.  follow company procedures to address workplace grievances.  document your claims.  ask for assistance. 

 This does NOT apply for people paying for their training, but for people who are looking for scholarships and sponsorships from airlines. The qualifications that will stand out on your CV in the airline industry are in subjects like Physics, Mathematics and English. Although mainly a qualification in Physics is required, other relevant qualifications push you through the tough competition in achieving these sponsorships. But as the airline world is slowly turning to technology these days, a qualification in IT or Electronics won't hurt.; , The worldwide airline language is English. If you are not an English speaker, you will need to start learning if you want to become a pilot. So, if you cannot read this article, start learning now.  If you are applying for a sponsorship and get through all the stages, the sponsor will sort everything out for you. Sponsorship schemes usually collaborate with flight training providers, so nothing to worry about there. And the training is usually completely free in this case. But if you are funding your own training, you will be looking to pay from around £50'000 to £100'000. The cost of flight training is very high, but if you have a strong ambition for piloting, you won't be questioning the price. But in most cases, the more you pay, the more well-reputed the training provider, which means an increase in your chances through the competition. Training in Europe will get you an EASA Licence. This is the licence you will need if you would like to fly for a European Airline. If you are looking to fly for an American Airline, then you should be looking for an FAA Licence.  Whether with flight training providers or with airlines, interviews are very important. In order to get the best out of your interview, you need lots of practice. Filming yourself or practicing with a friend/relative are both great practicing techniques. Consider looking into speaking with an experienced interviewer. They will provide you with useful information on how to conquer your interviews. And always remember to look your best when attending interviews, as interviewers have likely never seen you before and you don't want to ruin your first impressions.  Showing you have an interest in flying is a great sign. This could be from sailplane gliding to building model aircraft. Anything related to flying gives your CV a little shine to it.  Airlines want pilots with the right skills. Good communication, team-work, and organisation are the main set of skills one should have. The skills you have are important, it is not just the licence and the CV you hold that get you through.  Research is key when applying for a job. When it comes to the interview, the airline expects you to know quite a bit about them and their history. This also shows that you are well-organised and prepared for the interview.  If you hold a firm career ambition in Airline Piloting, the worst thing you can do is give up. There is always a way around things, even if it is hard to do so. Life is full of difficult challenges, but one should never give up on them. Never say never.  

gain the right qualifications.  the correct language.  get some flight training.  work on your interview skills.  fill your cv with as much essential information as possible.  have some good alternative skills.  research.  remember to never turn your back. 

 If your character has a fairly decent level, you can offer party assistance to low-level players. You can form a group and accompany other weaker players to dungeon levels that they won’t be able to get to without the help of a stronger player like you. This allows them to kill higher-level monsters and gain more experience points that they need to level up. You can ask for a couple thousand as payment for your service.  If you’re a priest, you can offer to heal wounded players instantly in exchange for a decent amount of Zeny. Most of the time, players forget to purchase potions while they’re on their quest. Keep in mind though that only a Priest or a High Priest has the skill to heal other players.  Another service that you can offer to other players if you’re of the Priest job is the Resurrection. Players that are out on a hunt will be reluctant to reload the game once they’re killed because they’ll have to respawn back to the dungeon entrance. Approach characters that are lying dead on the ground, and make an offer that you’ll resurrect them in exchange for a fair price.  

offer party assistance.  heal for a price.  resurrect for a price. 

 Instead, write "Apt. 6," "Room 52," or "Box 230."

Russians love saying the opposite of what they mean (irony), and you should be able to recognize when your lady's tone is not sincere. If you don't catch on, you may look simple.  Once your Slavic sweetie is wowed by your confidence, capability, and sense of humor, you can open up to her a little bit to show that you have a sensitive side. Choose the right time to reveal your deeper emotions. Here's how to do it:   Mention how much you love the elders in your family. If you tell her how much you love your grandmother (your Babushka), and how you call her every single day, she will be brought to tears. Talk about your siblings, and how protective you are over them. This will show that you can help her take charge of your household. If you have a pet cat or dog, talk about how much you love them in a non-embarrassing way. Show her pictures if she's interested.  Basically, it's complicated. The Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union until 1991. Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, all people under its power were considered to be Russian, whether they wanted to be or not. But Ukraine is a separate country with its own customs, language, and culture. The fastest way to annoy a Russian or Ukrainian woman is to not understand this difference. Here's what you need to know:   If you're in Russia, the native women there will consider themselves Russian. If you're in Ukraine, the native women there today will consider themselves Ukrainian for the most part. Unless their heritage is Russian. Due to the recent hostilities between pro-Russian separatists on one side and Ukrainian Army and Special forces on the other side - majority of Ukrainians no longer see Russia as a "brother nation". If you're in America, many Ukrainian immigrants from the capital city of Kiev will actually consider themselves Russian because the country was still considered to be a part of the USSR when they lived there and because they grew up speaking the Russian language. Before 1991, Russian was the language spoken in schools, used in newspapers, and in every day life in Kiev, but now, Ukrainian is used in schools, advertisements, and some television shows, though many city people still speak Russian at home. Don't tease the women from Ukraine who consider themselves Russian by saying, "What, are you ashamed of being from Ukraine?" Again---it's complicated. Just don't even go there.  Russian and Ukrainian languages with their own alphabet and unique way of speech. These women will be truly impressed if you have learned their native languages in school, on your own, or through a study abroad program. They will also be impressed if you show an interest in learning the language. Here's what to do:   Before you approach her, learn a few key phrases. Don't use them right away because that will just look corny, but using Russian phrases when the time is right will impress her. Here are a few words to say in Russian:  "Kak dela?" simply means, "What's up?" "Krasavitsa" means "a beauty." "Ti krasavitsa" means, "you are a beauty." "Dasvedaniya" means "goodbye" and "paka" is a more casual way of saying goodbye. "Prekrasno" means "amazing." "Ya tebya lyublu" means "I love you." "Ochen priyatno" is what you should say after you meet her family. It roughly means "Nice to meet you."   Ask your lady to speak Russian to you if she wants to. Don't be annoying about it---many Russian women are sick of everyone asking them to speak their language. If you are serious about dating a Russian or Ukrainian woman, you should try to learn her native language as much as you can. It will show a respect for her culture and will allow you to really understand her family.  If you don't already love Russian and Ukrainian food or don't know what it is, it's important to know and love a few key foods so you and your lady can cook together and so you can fit in at her family's dinner table. Here are a few basics:   Russians love dill and sour cream and can find a way to sneak it into most dishes, such as mashed potatoes. They don't go light on the salt, either. Borsch is a traditional beet-based soup that should be served hot with a healthy dose of sour cream. Pickled vegetables, such as tomatoes, pickles, and sauerkraut are key staples in a Russian household. Russians love their meats, from cold cuts, such as salami or ham, to Beef Stroganoff. They also don't say no to salmon. If you're dating a true Russian or Ukrainian woman, being a vegetarian is a near impossibility. Russians love salads with a healthy dose of mayo. One of their favorites is called Salad Olivier (originally french), which is a mix of mayo, ham, peas, and other vegetables. Blini, which is a thin crepe, are excellent with caviar, some honey and sugar, or---you guessed it---sour cream. Learn to love black bread.  In order to understand the workings of your new lady's mind, you'll have to have a sense of the quirks and traditions that make her culture unique. Knowing about these in advance will earn you lots of bonus points. Here are a few of them:   Don't hug, hand anything over, or do anything important in a doorway. It's a threshold that is meant only to be crossed. Before you leave for a journey, you must sit down for a minute to reflect on the trip ahead. If you accidentally step on her foot, she has to step on yours, or you will get in a fight. Don't use gestures to show something bad, such as touching your own body to show where your friend was hurt. This is bad luck. Don't ever wish her a happy birthday before her actually birthday because---believe it or not---it's bad luck.  Even if you don't know a lot about Russian films, literature, or artists, you should at least show a respect for the achievements of her people instead of seeing them as stereotypes. After all, she may not be the most well-read person in the world, but a few key insights will impress her:   Without being too nerdy, tell her that your favourite writers are Pushkin, Turgenev, Chekhov, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy. Know that Battleship Potemkin is an amazing film. Know who Yuri Gagarin, Gorbachev, and Peter the Great are, just to name a few figures. Don't make dumb jokes about her culture, like asking her if her dad is in the Russian mob or wanting to know if she knows any Ukrainian mail-order brides. This will show that you only see her culture as a stereotype.  Russian and Ukrainian women are quick to tell when you're being phony, but letting the woman know that there are many things you like about her in a sincere way can take your conversation to the next level. Here's what you do:   Make a few observations about things you like about her personality. If she tells you about a struggle she had, say, "You must be a very strong person," or if she has a great sense of humor, mention it. Once you're comfortable, move on to compliment her features, such as her nice eyes or her scintillating laugh. Compliment by teasing. If she tells you she loves to read, say that she's the cutest nerd you've ever met. Don't hurt her feelings, but show that you can joke around.  Russian and Ukrainian women are used to being fetishized and if you make them think that you only like them because they are exotic, or known to be beautiful, they will quickly be turned off. Here's what you should do:   Show an interest in her life by asking about her passions outside of your culture. Talk about her hobbies, her friends, or her job. Try not to ask too many questions about Russia or Ukraine right away unless she is open about it. Don't tell her that your last three girlfriends were Russian, or that she reminds you exactly of some Russian girl you know---this will not make her feel special.  If you've hit it off with your new lady, it's time to take your meeting to the next level. To ask out a Russian woman, you have to be a true gentleman and show that you're worth dating. Here's how:   Be direct. Russian women are forward and will appreciate if you can ask them out with confidence. Be a gentleman. Take her coat, buy her a drink, and hold a door for her. Do gentlemanly things to show that you will be a great date. When the time for the date comes, look your best and bring flowers. And don't be surprised if your girl is a little bit late---maintaining her good looks is hard work!  

look in the right places.  learn how to spot a russian or ukrainian woman by her looks.  learn to tell if a woman is russian or ukrainian because of what she says.  be confident.  be capable.  have a sense of humor.  show your softer side---but only a little bit.  understand the difference between a russian and a ukrainian girl.  learn the russian or ukrainian language.  develop a fondness for russian and ukrainian cuisine.  understand russian and ukrainian superstitions and customs.  respect russian and ukrainian culture.  compliment her without going overboard.  let her know you like her for who she is, not where she comes from.  ask her out. 

 Gently massaging your head stimulates blood flow to the scalp, encouraging hair to grow faster. You can do this while shampooing your hair in the shower, or on dry hair before going to bed at night. Brushing your hair and scalp with a firm-bristled brush can also provide the same effect.   To perform the massage, start making small circles with your fingertips, working from your hairline along the arteries in the front, side, and back of the head. Do not press with your fingernails. Work your way towards the top the head, as if drawing a circle. Aim to massage your scalp for just ten minutes a day, five in your morning shower and five before bed at night. Don't give up after a couple of days, try to make it a part of your daily routine.  Aside from being bad for your health in general, smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol and caffeinated drinks can have a detrimental effect on hair growth.   Smoking reduces blood flow to the scalp, causing hair to turn brittle and dull looking. The smoke from cigarettes can also turn graying hair an unwanted yellow hue, while imparting hair with an unpleasant odor.Alcohol can prevent the liver and colon from properly absorbing the nutrients you take in from food. Without certain essential nutrients, like A and B vitamins, hair becomes dull, weak, and may even begin to shed. Caffeine is dehydrating, and when your body is dehydrated it has a negative impact on the health of skin and hair. If you need your morning coffee to get going everyday, make sure to counteract its dehydrating effects by drinking lots of water.  Intense physical or emotional stress can cause hair growth to slow or shut down completely. In severe cases, stress can even cause hair loss. As a result, it is important to avoid stress and anxiety for the sake of your hair as well as your overall physical and emotional health.Stress affects hair growth by weakening your immune system and hindering your body's ability to produce healthy hair, skin and nails. When you are stressed, your body uses up any available energy and nutrients for essential functions like walking and talking, leaving none left over for things like healthy hair. To minimize stress levels, make sure you are getting plenty of sleep, exercising frequently and eating healthily.  If you want long hair for a particular event or occasion, you may want to consider getting hair extensions, especially if the event is coming up soon. Hair can take a long time to grow, so hair extensions are a good option if you want long hair but haven't got the time or patience to wait.   Hair extensions can be bonded to your own hair by a hair care professional, or you can purchase clip-in extensions that you can easily snap on or off yourself. If you're worried about looking tacky, don't fret. Hair extensions can be extremely natural looking if you invest in a high quality set made from 100% human hair. These can be a little on the pricey side, however.  There is no sure-fire way to make your hair grow. You cannot force your hair to grow any faster than its natural rate, all you can do is take good care of it and provide it with the optimal conditions. Except in rare circumstances, hair will grow a maximum of 6–8 inches (15.2–20.3 cm) a year when growing at its optimal rate.   For example, if your have hair that is currently chin length and want it to be below your shoulders, take a ruler and measure the space between where your hair is currently and where you want it to be. If you need 6 more inches to reach below your shoulders, plan on it taking 10-12 months for your hair to grow to your goal length. The natural growth rate of your hair depends mainly on genetics, which is why everyone's growth rate is different. Growing your hair involves a personal commitment to taking very good care of your hair and a great deal of patience.  In some cases, slow hair growth or hair loss can be due to an underlying medical condition or prolonged illness, certain prescription medications, substance abuse disorders, eating disorders, genetic or family history, or other serious medical situations. If you think any of these might be the problem, consult a physician immediately.   In many cases, resolving an underlying medical condition can help hair growth return to normal or speed up. If an underlying medical condition is the problem, certain hair-growth treatments and over-the-counter or prescription medications are available. Always consult your doctor before pursuing any of these options. 

massage your scalp.  cut back on caffeine, alcohol and smoking.  minimize stress.  consider hair extensions.  have realistic expectations.  make sure your slow hair growth is not caused by medical conditions or medications. 

 Eating the same meals consistently can affect the way we taste.Get out of this rut and actively try to experience different foods. A great way to start this process is by seeking out renowned foods from different cultures. Whether it’s Indian Curry, Lebanese Humus or a Pad Thai, try to find restaurants that prepare genuine cultural specialties.  Strong tastes can linger on your taste buds and affect the way you taste each course. As such, you essentially have to “reset” them between courses. You can do this in a few ways:   Sip lukewarm water. Suck on an orange slice. Snack on a soda cracker or bread stick., Don’t go slathering all your meals in hot sauce. Even if you might not be a master chef, you should consider expanding the contents of your spice rack, which will liven up your meals tremendously. A great start is with a classic marinara sauce. You can add oregano one week, swapping it for thyme or basil in the following weeks.Once you understand how different spices affect your meals, you can branch out and perform the same experiment with different foods.  Your sense of smell plays a vital role in how you taste different foods. As you eat, chemicals are released that reach olfactory receptors in your nose, which combine with your tastebuds to create the flavors you know.Here are a few ways to improve your sense of smell:   Exercise. Our sense of smell is most attuned right after exercise, this will make you more sensitive to the way your food tastes. Eat only when you’re hungry. Your sense of smell is much more sensitive when you are at your hungriest., Long-term smoking can damage the nerves that detect smells. Do this gradually, and ask your doctor for recommendations on how to quit smoking.  Wine and cheese tasting are the most common, as they are known for having strong tastes with subtle differences. For instance, you might be able to tell the difference between a Cabernet Sauvignon and a Pinot Noir, but might not be able to describe each flavor accurately. Attending these types of events exposes you to people with refined palates, which will let you learn the language used when describing flavors, as well as letting you experience them for yourself. You can find these events through a quick online search through directories such as Local Wine Events.  

step outside of your comfort zone.  cleanse your palate between courses.  try different spices.  improve your sense of smell.  stop smoking.  attend tasting events.

 It is important to know that before six years of age, children do not think of gender as permanent; they think that it is something that can be changed.Therefore, it is normal for your child to experiment with different kinds of dress, for example, for boys to wear dresses and for girls to wear suits.  It is also normal for children to want to play with toys that are normally reserved for the opposite gender.  Be open with yourself about how you feel about your child’s gender non-conformity. Are your feelings positive, neutral, or negative, and why? If your feelings are negative, before discussing cross dressing with your child, speak with a support group. This will help you figure out a way to discuss your child’s behavior without making them feel bad about their self.You can tell your child, "No matter who you are or how you dress, as your mom, I will always love and support you. Also ask them how they feel when they cross dress. Make sure they do not feel guilty about cross dressing. For example, say, "I want you to know that you shouldn't feel bad about dressing in boy's (or girl's) clothes.  Let your child define who they are. Try not to label them or force your child to decide who they are. They will figure this out in time. It is your job to be supportive of them; whatever or whoever they are.  Offer to make cross dressing outfits for their toys, for example, a dress for Batman, or a suit for Barbie.  Avoid punishing your child for cross dressing. Chances are they do not fully understand the meaning of their behavior. By punishing them, you are sending the message that you do not accept who they are. This can cause problems in the future if their cross dressing behavior continues on into adolescence. You want to be a good example of how to accept others who are different.  Don't make your child feel like they should overcome their behavior by saying, "You're old enough now to know that boys should not be wearing dresses. Why are you still wearing dresses and playing with dolls?" Or, "When are you going to grow out of this behavior?", It is important to avoid judging or shaming your child for their behavior. Instead, try to gain a better understanding of why they are crossdressing. You can do this by asking your child some questions, such as:  “How does dressing like that make you feel on the inside? Powerful? Brave? Pretty?” “Are you playing a pretend game? Who are you pretending to be?” “What you are usually thinking about when you play dress up?”  

know that it’s normal for children to experiment.  be honest with yourself.  let them lead the way.  don’t punish your child.  ask questions to better understand your child’s behavior. 

 She may be a family member, your friend or co-worker, your crush or just somebody you know. Every group of women has its category of gifts; however there is never a 100 percent conformity and compatibility.; , Be original and remember that your gift shouldn't be necessarily tangible. Make it a Christmas day to remember.  For example take her to a restaurant, or to a place where you could enjoy silence. , Remember that every woman appreciates the exterior look of a gift at first. This is why choose something that has original shapes, bright colors and anything that can catch her attention.  But be guided by the taste of the woman. Some women consider naming a star in their honor as the best present, though others would consider it something weird.  This idea passes almost to anyone, whether co-workers, family members and friends. All you have to think of is the sum you are willing to give.But be sure this is at a store she prefers to shop at. This, of course, should depend on what relationship you have with the woman. This way, you won't have doubts about the correctness of the gift chosen.  There are not many women that can resist the appeal of precious stones. It is important to know that you can make a jewelry present only to your closest women. Any jewelry is expensive and there it is thought that the higher the price, the deeper the feelings. When buying jewelry you spend probably the most significant part of your budget.

determine the category to which the receiver belongs to.  on christmas it is a tradition to buy different winter-related stuff that symbolizes appreciation, love and care.  if she means a lot to you and you really care about her and if she feels the same way then arranging a romantic evening would be a good idea.  if you are an employer and you are to make gifts to your female co-workers, you could consider a gift that would be useful during her everyday work.  ,  you should find out if the women that you're searching a gift for is the one that likes decorative or useful things.  getting some exclusive things could be also useful, because women adore exclusiveness.  you could also consider gift certificates and gift cards for christmas.  jewelry is a perfect gift for any occasion, especially earrings or a diamond necklace.  if she likes traveling then the best gift would be a trip to somewhere.  do not think only about things to give, but also think about services she'd love to receive. 

 Internal financing is generally cheaper than seeking outside funding for a project. Conduct a review of your company's financials to uncover areas where you can save money or redirect funds. Some areas to check include within subsidiaries, executive perks, capital expenditure, and recruitment expenses, among others., If you determine that outside funding is necessary, consider selling stock or acquiring a loan. A loan can reliably provide capital to the company, however it can also restrict their activities and may charge a higher interest rate than a bond issuance would. With stock issuances, companies can get even cheaper capital, however now they have sold even more of their equity to investors and may be held responsible for fulfilling investor requests.   Bonds should not be issued by companies who already carry large amounts of debt, as a bond issuance simply increases debt and makes an already unstable company more so., Private placement involves the selling of unregistered (not registered with the SEC, that is) stocks or bonds to institutional investors. This type of bond may be advantageous to a company as the costs of the issuance are cheaper due to smaller regulatory and marketing costs. However, this type of issuance still requires the assistance of an investment bank, both to file the proper letter of intent and private placement memorandum and to connect the issuing company with institutional investors (large, non-bank funds).Private placements are advantageous for smaller companies. The process of issuing them is simpler and minimum size requirements are lower. In general, a regular corporate issue will require a minimums in the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. However, private placements can be issued with much lower total values., In order to issue corporate bonds, the company will have to be sure that it is able to make payments on the bonds. That is, future cash flows will have to be substantial enough to cover both the coupon payments every six months or every year and the par value of the bonds when they reach maturity. This will require both a schedule of potential bond payments and the future expenses and earnings of the company.   The company will also have to factor in transaction costs associated with the issuance of the bonds, which will be charged by the investment bank. For these reasons, bond issuances are usually not a good idea for startups, because their revenues may be low or negative for the first couple years of operation, leaving them unable to service their debt obligation., Bonds are issued with specific durations and the duration and payment frequency of your bonds will depend on your capital needs. In addition, your bond will be rated for risk based on your company's risk profile. The combination of these factors will determine the interest rate on the bond. In addition, market analysis will determine the price on the bond. These are the basic terms of the bond, however there may be others, including:   Whether or not the bond is secured by the company's assets. These "collateralized" bonds allow investors to claim the company's assets in the event the bond payments go unpaid. Collateralized debt may carry less interest expense for the issuer, as it is considered less risky. Callable bonds. These bonds are able to be "called," or paid off, before the maturity date. Convertible bonds. These are bonds that can be converted into a set number of the company's shares of stock. Ideally, these allows for the investor to benefit from rising stock prices and the company can then be off the hook for repaying the bonds., The initial prospectus for a corporate bond issuance must be a publicly distributed prospectus. That is, it must be available to the public and meet certain criteria. This prospectus must specify the following information:   The nature of the issuer's business. A management profile of the issuer. A list of principal investors. The conditions or features of the bonds being issued. Financial risks inherent to the company or the bonds., Additional supplemental information may be required to be submitted to the SEC when registering your bond issue. The SEC will specify the nature of this information. However, in all cases the SEC will require financial records and statements from the company for the present year and in some cases for a number of prior years. These documents must comply with US generally accepted accounting procedures (GAAP) and must be prepared by a certified public accountant (CPA)., If the issuer is already working with an underwriter or underwriting syndicate, all of the participants in the deal, including the issuer and members of the underwriting syndicate, work collectively on the language and format of the registration statement.Otherwise, the issuer will be responsible for this filing.  Corporate bonds cannot be offered for sale to the public without the approval of the SEC. If there are issues with your registration, you will be forced to correct them before you can move forward., The underwriter is an investment bank acts as a middleman between the bond issuer and the investors. Contact several investment banks and ask if they are interested in underwriting your bond issuance. Those that are will submit initial prospectuses, sometimes called red herrings because of their color, that will describe their strategy for the sale of the bonds, including pricing, marketing strategies, and syndication plans.   The issuer may have to meet with several banks several different times to clarify proposal strategies and negotiate terms., The underwriting firm works with your company (the issuer) to begin the process of issuing corporate bonds by determining the specifics of the bond, including when the bonds will mature, the interest rate offered, and the price of the bonds. Both the issuer and the underwriting firm will be represented by legal counsel.   Investment banks function as underwriters because they have a better understanding of bond market and regulations than the issuer., The primary underwriter will invite other investment firms to join the deal. Those who accept the invitation create what is called an underwriting syndicate. Your project is deemed officially "launched" once the syndicate has been formed.   Forming a syndicate allows the underwriters to reduce individual risk and reach a larger group of potential investors., Set the final price of the issue after you've sent the registration letter and taken preliminary orders for the bonds. Submit the final pricing to the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) which is a part of the National Association of Securities Dealers.   The underwriter should price the bond in accordance with their understanding of the bond market. This includes gauging demand for this type of bond, for bonds within the industry, and interest/trust in the issuer. That is, the issuer using has no involvement in the determination of the price of the bonds beyond choosing an underwriter to help them do that pricing.In many cases, the investment bank will include a provision in the offering proposal to buy a certain number or all of the bonds being created. In this case, the bank will then seek to sell the bonds to the public at a higher price than they paid. The difference is referred to as the underwriting spread., A completed offering proposal will include four distinct parts that describe the issuer and the bond being issued:   The executive summary, which summarizes the issuer's nature, key financials, goals in issuing the bonds, and any associated risks. Investment considerations, which lists the terms of the bond, including pricing, collateral, conditions, and other terms. An industry overview comparing the position of the issuer relative to others in the industry and an overall analysis of the industry. A financial model that specifies preliminary coupon rates and projected company financials. This information is estimated and is not meant to be binding or perfectly correct., A bought deal is one where the underwriter purchases a number of shares from the bond issuance in order to resell them itself. The issuer agrees on a maturity and yield for these bonds that is then locked in by the underwriter. The underwriter can then turn around and resell these bonds to syndicate members, institutional investors, and the public for a profit (the underwriting spread)., The remainder of the bonds not sold to institutional investors or syndicate members will be sold to the public. Publicly-issued bonds can be issued in capital markets or banking markets, or both. Work with the underwriter or underwriting syndicate to determine the best market for your bonds based on the nature of your issuance., The maturity (or maturities), interest rates, and price of the bond will be officially set before the bond are sold. These prices only refer to the sale in the primary market, which is the first time that the bonds are sold. Afterwards, bonds traded from the original originals will be traded in the secondary market and may change prices. However, the issuer will only receive proceeds from the sale of the bonds in the primary market., The Lead Manager will complete a questionnaire from the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTC) which will allow you to be eligible for the bonds services that DTC provides, such as distribution and depository. Once your issue has been approved, you can commence marketing and taking orders for your bonds.Bonds may be marketed to investors through the underwriters' personal connections or through financial publications like the Wall Street Journal or Barron's., After you have received payment for the bonds, created your corporate bonds, and deposited them with DTC, the lead underwriter handles the distribution of the bonds to the underwriting syndicates who in turn issue the bonds to investors. This allocation is sometimes referred to as syndication., After the bonds have sold, the lead underwriter is responsible for distributing the funds to the issuer. The issuer can then use these funds to begin or continue whatever project or capital purchases the bonds were originally intended to finance., Companies may choose to issue bonds in the private market for a number of reasons. Some do it for the fact that private placements can typically be issued at a lower cost to the issuer, because underwriter fees may be smaller or nonexistent. Others enter the market to keep their finances private or to diversify their creditors. In addition, some small companies are not able to issue bonds publicly because the total value of the bond issue does not meet underwriter thresholds.Private placement can theoretically be any size, from a very small offering under $1 million to very large ones in the billions of dollars., Private placement bonds can carry the same terms as public bonds. That is, you can set the price, interest rate, and maturity of the bonds, along with other conditions, like making them convertible or callable bonds. Note when pricing these bonds that private placement bonds typically pay higher interest rates than publicly issued bonds.   An investment bank, though not required for a private placement issue, can help an issuer set up their bond terms to appeal to certain institutional investors. Bonds can also be issued in tranches, which are simply separate groups of bonds differentiated by different interest rates or maturities., The SEC requires that the purchasers of any private placement bonds be "qualified institutional investors." This is a term meaning that the investor is one who can understand the risks of trading securities and can bear those risks. These investors are typically institutions, like pension funds, who have over $100 million under management. The issuer can work with an underwriter to locate these investors or work to locate their own., The letter of intent, or investment letter, is a letter signed by the institutional investors that promises that the private placement bonds are for investment and not for resale to the public. This is because private placement securities cannot be resold for 2 years. When they are sold, they must be registered with the SEC., The private placement memorandum, also called an offering memorandum, is the private placement equivalent of a prospectus. It describes the issuer, its management, and business plans, and contains financial statements and information. It also describes every detail of the offering, including risks, terms, interest rates, conditions, and other relevant information. 

consider internal financing first.  look into alternative external fundraising options.  consider private placement.  calculate the cost of issuing bonds.  decide on bond terms.  write a publicly distributed prospectus.  gather required supplemental information.  compile the information and submit the registration statement to the sec.  wait for approval before moving forward.  solicit proposals from underwriters.  select an underwriter.  invite additional underwriters to be involved in the deal.  price the bonds.  compile the offering proposal.  negotiate a bought deal.  locate the right market for the bonds.  finalize bond terms.  market the bonds.  allocate bonds to purchasers.  distribute funds.  choose private placement over a public issuance.  decide on bond terms.  identify qualified institutional investors.  have investors complete letters of intent.  draft and send out a private placement memorandum. 

 If you can't find any oatmeal powder, use old fashioned oats instead. Pulse them in a blender or food processor until finely ground., Be sure to break up any lumps or clumps. You want the mixture to be very smooth.  Use your fingers to spread the mask onto your face, taking care to avoid the eye area. Then, gently massage your skin using small, circular motions for about 5 seconds. This will help exfoliate your skin.  If you see any residue, wash it off using a mild facial soap.  

add the cocoa powder, honey, oatmeal powder, and heavy cream into a small bowl.  mix everything together with a spoon or spatula.  spread the mixture onto a clean face, and then gently massage it for about 5 seconds.  rinse the mixture off with warm water after 15 to 30 minutes, and then gently pat your face dry. 

 Any type of flour works for this purpose, but use a typical balloon rather than a water balloon, as water balloons are thinner and more susceptible to popping.   Don't get a cheap balloon, as these will pop easily. You may even want to put one balloon inside of another balloon before filling it, as a precaution. If you have an allergy to latex, use latex-free balloons.  You can use your fingers to gently widen the neck of the balloon.  Take a small spoon and begin adding flour into the balloon. Be cautious to avoid spilling flour all over your workspace.  The balloon should be full enough so that there's minimal air, but not full enough that it's impossible to change its form using your hands. If it's firm to the touch, it's too full, and you run the risk of it bursting and making a mess everywhere when you squeeze it.  Stretch out the neck of the balloon, then knot it by creating a loop and slipping the end of the neck through the loop. Make sure not to flip the balloon in a way that causes the flour to spill out.   If you've "double-bagged" the balloons, be sure to tie both of the balloons, not just one. Tuck the innermost knot into the second balloon, and then knot the outermost balloon.  You can knead the balloon with your hands and move the flour around inside of the balloon. Just be careful not to squeeze all the flour to one end of the balloon, or it might pop!  

get a balloon and some flour.  open the neck of the balloon.  spoon flour into the balloon.  stop when the balloon is at a medium size.  tie the neck of the balloon shut.  squeeze the balloon. 

 Heat may break down the chemicals already applied, undermining their residual effect. As a general rule, apply chemicals after steaming.; , This will increase the effectiveness of the steamer. If possible, use a vacuum cleaner with a bag, as this allows for easy disposal of any bed bugs that may have been captured in the vacuum. If you have a bagless vacuum cleaner, dispose of all contents in a bag outside of your house, place the bag straight into the outdoor garbage, then wash the vacuum container and filter in as hot water as the vacuum components can stand. Allow to air dry before refitting to the vacuum cleaner.   Another option is to use a steamer/vacuum combination.  Remember that steamers produce extremely hot steam, so use caution to avoid burning yourself.  Do this both when the steamer heats up initially and when moving between locations. Once the water is purged, you can attach the appropriate accessory and begin steaming.   Keep a dry towel or moisture-absorbent cloth on hand to help absorb excess water that may accumulate while steaming.  and work your way down to the floorboards. The steamer can be used on moldings, mattresses, box springs, headboards, sofas, carpeting, floorboards and more. However, never steam into an electrical outlet or appliances!  , Some steamers have a pressure control valve, allowing you to control the pressure of the steam.  Keep the tip of the nozzle about one to two inches (2.5cm-5cm) from the surface you are treating, and move at a rate of about one inch (2.5cm) per second.  Applying encasements before the steam has dried may result in the growth of mold.  If signs of bed bugs appear, re-treat the area with steam. It is always recommended to follow up a steam treatment with an EPA-approved bed bug spray.  

use caution when steaming an area that has recently been treated with chemicals (including diatomaceous earth powder).  before steaming, vacuum the areas to be treated.  carefully read the instructions provided with your steamer to prepare the steamer for operation.  purge the steamer into a cloth towel to clear the nozzle of excess water that has been collected.  when steaming, start from the top of the room (drapes, etc.),  when possible, use a larger head attachment for the nozzle, as smaller heads may create too much centralized pressure, thus scattering the bed bugs rather than killing them.  take your time with the steamer.  after steaming your mattress, allow adequate time for the steam to completely dry before applying a mattress, box spring or pillow encasement.  after steaming, keep an eye out for any signs of bed bugs in the next few days. 

 These may include other people, noise, television, music, your phone, and the internet.   Temporarily block websites that you know might distract you, such as social media websites and apps. Some people prefer to use earplugs to block or reduce out any ambient noise. Let others around you know that you have to work on an assignment and would appreciate not being disturbed. Call off anything you'd plan to do otherwise. Explain that you have a last minute essay to finish. Be persistent if people try to pull you away from your work: "I'd go out if I could, but I have to finish this essay. Maybe tomorrow?"; , Wherever you are working to write the essay, make sure it is clear of clutter and is comfortable. Just don’t take things too far. You’re trying to make your workspace conducive to writing, but if you find yourself trying to deep clean your entire house before you write your essay, you’re probably just procrastinating. , This includes any textbooks, notes, articles, research, etc., as well as your computer and/or writing utensils.   If you have any other things that help you write, like snacks or coffee, have those easily available as well. You’ll need to stay energized and comfortable throughout the writing process.  Once you have everything you need to start writing, take a moment to focus before you begin. Breathe in, and try to focus your mind on the essay you are about to write. Motivate yourself by thinking about how you are now ready to tackle the task of writing, rather than stressing about how you don’t have enough time: "I can do this. I've got everything I need in front of me. I just need to focus for X amount of time, and then I'll be through with this essay."  , Pulling an "all nighter" is not recommended when trying to write an essay, as it can leave you exhausted and your work seeming unfocused. If you are in a situation where you have to do this, however, a few guidelines will help you to do the best you can:Save caffeine for when you really need it. Try to avoid having too much early on in the process, because caffeine will eventually cause you to mentally "crash." Don't get too comfortable. Write in a place that means "work" to you, such as a desk, study room, or library. Try not to get in your pajamas or lie in bed. You'll want to keep your mind on writing, not drifting off to sleep. Get some exercise now and then. Get up from your work to walk around for a few minutes, or do a few pushups, etc. once in a while while working on your essay. A little bit of exercise will help keep you energized and stay focused. Get plenty of sleep the next day. You will need to recover from your lack of sleep.  Look over any prompt or guidelines you have for writing the essay very carefully. Sometimes fully understanding the assignment is half the battle.You will want to make sure you follow any instructions you are given regarding the length, format, and content of the essay. Usually, the keys to writing a great essay are there in the prompt.   For example, if you are writing for a literature class and a prompt asks you to "illustrate your argument with specific evidence," you'll know that means the essay will need to quote directly from the text you are reading.  Choose a style you prefer (bullet points, a diagram, brief sentences, etc.). The outline doesn’t necessarily have to be very extensive, but at the very least you should jot down the main points you think your essay will make.When making your outline, work closely with the texts or research you will use to write the essay. Look for key points and quotations that you think you might incorporate into the essay, and make a note of them. While it might seem like stopping to make an outline will eat up precious time, it will actually help you write more efficiently and clearly.Having a few points in mind, and a sense of direction, will keep the essay from rambling.  This is especially the case if you are working on a paper that requires research or outside readings. It is tempting to put off the actual writing of the essay by doing more research, but the preparation has to come to an end so you can begin your work.You can always come back to your research while you are writing or revising if you think you need to incorporate more.  Many rushed papers lack a strong thesis.Spending extra time focusing your main objective will result in a stronger essay. What question will your essay address?   Sometimes, an essay prompt gives you a specific question to answer, and sometimes you are asked to develop your own, so read your assignment directions carefully. Whatever the case, your thesis is your specific answer to the question.  This means that you will be working to convince your reader of your point by providing evidence to back it up.Write out your thesis when you are making your outline. If it sounds like too obvious of a point, revise it until it seems more arguable. A thesis is more than a topic or statement of fact.   "United States government" is an example of a topic or subject. "The United States government is comprised of three branches: the legislative, the judicial, and the executive" is a statement of fact. "The structural division of the United States government into the legislative, judicial, and executive branches is responsible for the long-term stability of the nation" is an example of a thesis because it would leave a reader expecting you to explain further. They might wonder, for example, why you think the branches of the government are responsible for the nation's stability, as opposed to economic or cultural factors, and you essay has the opportunity to explain and answer this.  There are several kinds of theses. For example, an expository thesis explains something to readers, while an analytical thesis breaks down a topic into parts and evaluates them. Even an essay based on a narrative (story) will benefit from a clear thesis.Read your prompt or assignment sheet carefully to understand which kind of thesis you need for your essay.   A prompt that asks you to "Evaluate the relationship between the branches of the United States government," for example, seeks an analytical thesis. On the other hand, a prompt that asks you to "Describe the process by which the United States government was divided into three branches" is asking you to narrate a sequence of events.  The introduction is a very important part of an essay—perhaps the most important—because it orients your reader and explains your argument.For the first draft, however, don’t agonize over it. You just need to begin writing. The introduction doesn’t have to be perfect in the first draft, because you can come back and edit it later. Get something down, and it will help you move confidently forward.   When you are pressed for time, don't worry too much about writing a creative introduction--just try to write one that is clear and focused. If you have time left at the end, you can come back and try to improve it. A simple but effective plan is to make sure that your introduction states your essay's thesis, and gives an overview of what the subsequent paragraphs or sections will discuss. Your outline will help you do this. A simple version of this would look something like "In this essay, I will first describe X, before moving on to Y and Z. Then, I will explain the relationship between X,Y, and Z, demonstrating that ."  , Take the writing of the essay bit by bit, following the outline you made. This will keep your writing on track, and keeping your plan in mind will encourage you to keep going.  If you're wavering between describing Shakespeare as a "great" writer, or "the greatest," for example, just pick one for now and move on.You’ll be able to deal with such things when you do a final read-through of the essay. When time is short, you will write more productively, and keep your morale up, if you keep pushing through with more writing. , If you are quoting another work, cite it according to the style (MLA, APA, Chicago, etc.) your instructor wants you to use. Even if you are just paraphrasing a work, you should cite it. If you don’t properly cite your sources, you are plagiarizing. As a rule of thumb, if you got an idea or information from a source outside of your own head, you should cite it.It is far easier to cite while you are writing than to go back and try to add in citations after you have written your paper. Keep up with them as you go.  While you have to work quickly, take a short break from writing now and then, especially if you get stuck—just don’t get distracted and take too long.   Some prefer to take scheduled breaks, by setting a timer or watching a clock. Others prefer to take a break after reaching a convenient stopping point, such as the end of a paragraph or page. Whatever method you choose, make a note of where to pick back up when you return to writing.Take a breath, get up, have a drink or snack. By taking a short break, you’re not wasting time—you’re actually helping yourself write more efficiently by clearing your head and relieving stress., Look back over your essay and make sure one last time that your thesis makes sense and is arguable, and that your writing supports it. Editing at the end is a critically important step.While it can be tempting to consider yourself done once you have a draft, you can greatly improve your essay (and eventual grade) if you take some time to review it and make any necessary changes. Review your essay’s structure, organization, and style. Make sure your paragraphs proceed in a logical way; move them around if they don’t. Now is also the time to go back and edit any of your sentences for word choice, clarity, and grammar.  If you're really pressed for time, then probably the most beneficial things you can do to improve your essay are to make a reverse outline and to revise your introduction.A reverse outline is a great, quick strategy to check the logic of your essay’s structure.To do this, you create an outline from your finished draft, jotting down the main ideas of your essay paragraph by paragraph. The result will look much like an outline you would create before writing an essay, but you can use it to double-check your finished product. Editing your introduction can clarify your thesis and make your essay stronger. While you made your outline and began writing your essay with a certain idea of what your thesis or "point" was, that idea probably changed at least slightly as you wrote the essay itself. Go back to the intro after you have finished a draft of the essay and make any changes to the wording of your thesis based on what the rest of the essay says (the reverse outline will help figure this out).  At the final stage of writing, do a quick check of your essay for any remaining spelling and grammatical errors.   Electronic spelling and grammar checkers can help you out, but don’t rely on them to do all the work. Always do a read-through before submitting your work. The most efficient technique for catching mistakes is to read your work out loud.Get someone you know and trust to proofread your work, if you can. A pair of fresh eyes can catch mistakes you might have overlooked.  Print the essay if you need to. If you are submitting electronically, do everything you can to make sure the file type is correct and the file was received.  

remove or minimize distractions in your workspace.  prepare your workspace for writing.  gather whatever materials you will need to write the essay.  take a deep breath.  work extra hard to focus if you're planning on writing late into the night.  start by reading the assignment.  make an outline.  don’t use over-preparation as a way of procrastinating.  consider what the main point of your essay will be.  formulate a thesis that is arguable.  choose a thesis that is appropriate to your assignment type.  begin with the introduction.  follow your outline.  don’t get caught up worrying about word choice, spelling, etc.  cite any works you use as a reference or for quotations.  pace yourself.  reevaluate your essay’s thesis and argument.  focus your editing if you are running out of time.  proofread your work.  submit your work on time. 

 When you first get your Toyger kitten, you need to make sure she is up to date on her vaccinations. Ask her previous owner or breeder for her records so you know what care she has already received. At six weeks, she should have had her core vaccinations, including those for distemper, feline rhinotracheitis, and feline calici virus.   At nine to 10 weeks, she should have a booster for these vaccinations and her last boosters for these at 14 to 16 weeks. She may also need these repeated at one year old. At 12 to 16 weeks, she should have her rabies vaccination. This will need to be repeated every year. She may have also gotten a feline leukemia test at the same time as her first distemper vaccine.; , When you take your kitten for her first check up around eight to nine weeks, your vet should start the deworming process on her. This should be redone every three to four weeks and at least two additional times after the first., Before your Toyger reaches six months old, you need to decide if you want to breed her. If you don’t, have her spayed (or neutered if male). This will help prevent unwanted kittens as well as cut down on undesirable behavior such as heat behaviors and urine spraying.   You can have her fixed as early as eight weeks., After your Toyger reaches one year old, you need to take her back to the vet at least once a year for a health checkup. She should be given her rabies vaccination and be checked for any issues. Once she reaches 10 years old, take her twice a year to avoid any specific diseases more common in senior cats.   Although your Toyger should generally be healthy, there is one breed specific problem to be aware of. During these regular checkups, make sure your vet looks for heart murmurs, which have been noted as common in this breed. 

vaccinate your cat.  deworm your cat.  spay or neuter your cat.  take her for regular checkups. 

 When working with a horse’s hooves it's important to move the horse's foot into position in a way that doesn't surprise the horse or irritate it. Make sure the horse is aware of your presence by gently patting it on the rump. To get your horse to lift her foot, run your hand down her leg. Then, squeeze the tendon above the ankle and lift the hoof. The horse should shift its weight to its other three feet.While you work, hold the foot in place by tucking your hip against the horse's hock (the large joint on the hind leg) and gaskin (the muscle above the hock). Use the inside of your knee to pull the foot out slightly and up between your legs so that the sole of the hoof faces up towards you. Support the horse's toe with one hand. This position locks the horse's foot in place, making it difficult for the horse to kick or put its foot on the ground before you're done working. Make sure that you reward your horse with praise for cooperating and waiting while you clean her hooves. Saying, “good girl” or “yes” after she lifts each hoof for you will help to reinforce your horse’s good behavior.; , To remove a horseshoe, first, "break" (straighten) the nail clinches (the bent tips of each nail that holds the shoe on) with a clinch cutter and a hammer. Work the blade of the clinch cutter under the clinch, then hit it with a hammer to straighten the nail. Then, use a pair of metal pull-offs to loosen and remove the shoe. Close the jaws of the pull-offs around the outside heel of the shoe and use an outside to center rocking motion, working towards the toe to loosen the shoe. Repeat for the inside heel and proceed in this fashion until the shoe can be pulled off.Several alternatives exist for breaking the nail clinches. In a pinch, you can use a rock and a flat head screwdriver to bend the nail tips upwards, or, if you're careful not to wear a hole in the hoof wall, you can even use a rasp to file the nail clinches away.  For your horse's health and safety, you don't want dirt or debris trapped between its new shoe and its foot. Before shoeing your horse, use a hoof pick to remove any compacted dirt, mud, rocks, manure, etc. from your horse’s foot. Use downward strokes from heel to toe. Follow the hoof pick with a wire brush for added cleanliness.Take care around the frog - the triangular portion in the middle of the hoof. This part of the hoof is extra-sensitive.  Typically, before a horse is shod, the dark, hard, outer layer of each hoof's sole is removed to reveal the softer, whiter material underneath in a process roughly equivalent to trimming a human's toenails. Take care not to cut too deep, or you risk hurting the horse or even rendering it temporarily lame - the same as if you'd cut a person's nails too short.This process is easiest if you keep your hoof knife razor sharp. But use caution. It's easy to accidentally slip and cut yourself while working.  The hoof wall - the edge of the hoof - should extend about 3 inches (7.6 cm) to 3 & 3/4 inches from the hairline above the hoof itself. If it's any longer, use a set of nippers (essentially giant nail clippers) to trim the edge of the hoof to a suitable length.You should see a ridge where the hoof wall extends beyond the sole. Do not cut into the sole with the nippers, or you may injure the horse.When you trim the hoof with nippers, be sure to keep the trimmed edges of the hoof uniformly straight and level so that they'll sit flush with the ground. Trim from each side of the heel to the toe.  The exception to this is in cases where a horse's gait wears its hoof unevenly - in this case, you'll want to take slightly less hoof material off of the side that the horse favors. Use caution when making this distinction and, if unsure, consult an experienced farrier.  The very last thing that must be done to prepare the hoof for its shoe is to ensure the bottom of the hoof is smooth, flat and level. Use a rasp to gently file any uneven spots on the bottom of the hoof, taking care, as always, not to wear the hoof too short or irritate the frog. Then using your knife, pare away slightly to bevel the sole away from the hoof wall. Contact of the sole on the shoe can cause the horse discomfort., As with human feet, horse feet come in many different sizes and, thus, different horses will require different-sized shoes. Before proceeding, ensure that the shoes you have available are the correct size for your horse's feet. Note that a horse's front and hind feet are differently-shaped, so you will need different shoes for each.most horses have a size smaller in the back then the front, but not always.   If you have to choose between shoes that are slightly too big and shoes that are slightly too small, choose the bigger shoes. These can be bent, shaped, and ground down to a smaller size, while too-small shoes can't be made bigger. Too long a shoe in front will cause the horse to step on the exposed heel of the shoe and pull it off.  Often, even if horse shoes are the correct size, they will not fit a horse's foot without adjustments. Like human feet, horse feet can be asymmetrical or uneven. There are several ways to custom-shape horseshoes.   If you're a knowledgeable metalworker, you can heat the shoe until the steel can be bent to the size of the hoof. Or, you can cold shape the shoe on an anvil using a hammer and tongs. Some farriers do neither, opting instead to grind their shoes down until they fit with a rasp or grinding machine.  Well-fitting horse shoes should align well with the edge of the hoof. Keep in mind that it may take some time to get a shoe to the perfect size for your horse.  Align the shoe so that it sits perfectly against the edge of the hoof, then drive nails through the holes in the shoe to fix it to the horse's foot. When doing this, care must be taken so as not to hurt or hobble the horse.   Drive the nail through the hoof at an outward angle so that the nail tips go through the top of the hoof wall.  Never drive nails into the sensitive inner portion of the hoof. To make this easier, use hoof nails that have a bevel on one side to guide the tip through the hoof wall.With these special nails, the manufacturer's stamp on the side of the nail head should face the center of the foot (towards the frog) - this ensures that the bevel is facing the right direction. Some modern horseshoes use glue, rather than nails, to hold the shoe in place.If you're worried about hurting your horse, you may want to try this alternative. Note that application methods for glue-on shoes can vary - consult the manufacturer or an experienced farrier for more information.  Once each nail has been driven, use the claw end of your hammer to bend the tip of the nail over against the hoof wall. Then, twist off the tip or use a pair of nippers to bend and clip the tips off. Try leave about 1/8" of the tip bent over the edge of the hole formed by the nail pointing towards the toe. This ensures that the nail will hold the shoe in place without the sharp tip hurting you or the horse.  Set a clinch block under the nail on the outer hoof wall, then set the nail in the hoof (or "clinch" it) by hitting the nail head once again with the driving hammer. This gives the nail a firm grip in the horse's hoof, ensuring the shoe stays in place. You may use a sturdy metal tool, like your nippers, in place of the clinch block in a pinch.   Another option is to use a special tool called a clincher. With this tool, all you need to do is align the jaws of the clincher over the nail tip and squeeze the handles.  Finally, give the outside of the hoof a once-over with a rasp, smoothing out any uneven spots and giving the hoof a nice clean finish. Pay special attention to the clinched nail tips, which can also be filed smooth.When finished, you should be able to draw a cloth over the hoof wall without it catching.   You may also notice that excess hoof material protrudes over the edge of the shoe. If this is the case, use a pair of nippers or pull-offs to remove it.  Remember that the front and back hooves will require differently-shaped shoes and that even the two front and back feet may not be perfectly symmetrical with each other.  

lift the horse's foot.  remove any shoes that are already on the horse's feet.  clean the bottom of the hoof.  use a hoof knife to remove excess, flaky sole from the bottom of the hoof.  trim excess hoof wall with hoof nippers.  use a rasp to flatten and level the the sole.  size the shoe to its hoof.  make minor adjustments to the shape of the shoe, if needed.  secure the shoe in its place with nails.  bend and remove the nail tips.  clinch the nail.  file any rough spots on the hoof wall.  repeat process three more times until all four hooves have been shod.

 Also, make sure that the toothpaste does not contain any silica, or you will risk scratching your jewelry.  Squeeze out any excess water. You want the cloth to be damp, and not soaking wet. Try to use a non-abrasive, lint-free cloth, such as microfiber.  You do not need a lot—less than a pea-sized amount will be more than enough. You can always apply more toothpaste later.  Be sure to go with the grain, and not across it. If you rub the cloth across the grain, you will risk scratching it. Also, take care to avoid any gemstones set into your jewelry; many gemstones are very soft and can be easily scratched by toothpaste.  Run the bristles under warm water, and apply more toothpaste if necessary. Gently scrub the toothpaste across the surface of the jewelry. Make sure that you are going with the grain, and not against it.Take care to avoid touching any gemstones.  If needed, rinse the toothbrush with water, then use it to clean out any residual toothpaste out of nooks and crannies., This will prevent any water spots.If your jewelry has a lot of details in it, such as a brooch or necklace chain, gently wrap it up in the cloth and wait a few minutes before unwrapping it. This will give the soft cloth time to soak up any excess water.  Make sure that the polish you use is labeled safe for stainless steel. Do not use silver polish, as it will leave stains. When polishing the jewelry, be sure to go with the grain, and not across it. 

choose a plain, white toothpaste without silica.avoid using gel toothpaste, as it lacks that special cleaning powder that regular white toothpaste has.  dampen the corner of a soft cloth with warm water.  squeeze out a small amount of toothpaste onto the cloth.  gently run the cloth across the surface of the jewelry.  use a soft-bristled toothbrush to reach detailed, intricate areas.  plug the sink, and rinse the jewelry off with warm water.  gently pat the jewelry dry with a soft cloth.  polish your stainless steel jewelry, if needed, with jewelry polish or polishing cloth.finished.

 It's absolutely essential that you warm up properly before stretching or attempting the splits.          Warming up helps to prevent pulled muscles (which can put you out of action for a while) and will also help you to get a deeper stretch. You can warm up any way you like, as long as it gets the blood flowing around the body—try doing 5 to 10 minutes of jumping jacks, running around the block, or energetically dancing to your favorite song.  If you want to achieve the splits in a week or less, you're going to have to really commit to your stretching routine.   You have to practice twice a day, without fail, for about 15 minutes at time. If you can get a third 15-minute session in (without pushing yourself too hard) then that's even better. Try to accomplish other tasks while doing your stretching to make the time go more quickly. Listen to music, do it while watching TV, or while learning something for school—like spellings or math tables.  Doing any task is easier when you have a friend there to help you and push you to do better.          A friend can help you to stretch and split deeper by pushing down on your shoulders or legs when you're in position. Just make sure that they'll stop immediately if you tell them to—you need to be able to trust them completely! You could also try to make it a competition to see who can achieve the splits first—this is good motivation to work harder at your stretching.  Wearing the right clothes will help you to feel more comfortable and flexible while you stretch, and will also help to prevent clothes from ripping while you're doing the splits.   Wear comfortable athletic clothes that are either loose and baggy, or stretchy and elastic (so they move with your body). Martial arts gear is also a good choice. One good tip is to wear socks while practicing your splits, as these will allow your feet to slide along the floor more easily, helping you to achieve a deeper stretch.  Achieving the splits in a week or less is a pretty difficult task, so it's important that you don't push yourself too hard trying to achieve it -- your safety is more important. You will slow yourself down if you are injured. A good rule of thumb is to only stretch mildly if you wake up sore. Wait a whole day or more if you totally bypassed your limits to do any intense stretching. Prevent needing this by taking it slow and always warming up.          While you're practicing the splits, you should feel a good, intense stretch in your muscles, but you should not feel any pain. If you experience pain, this is a sign that you are pushing yourself too hard. Pushing yourself too hard can lead to strained muscles and other injuries, which will prevent you from achieving the splits anytime soon (if at all). Remember that it's better to take your time and achieve the splits safely, than it is to rush and hurt yourself.  

warm up before you stretch.  practice for 15 minutes, twice a day.  enlist a friend to help you.  wear the right clothes.  know your limits. 

 Dry ice is very cold and should never be handled directly. Protective, insulated or leather gloves should be worn while handling the ice. An oven mitt or towel is also sufficient to protect your skin.Prolonged direct contact to dry ice can freeze your skin cells and cause an injury similar to a burn.If possible, use tongs to transfer the dry ice to different locations.  Dry ice can be obtained in a pellet or block form. During production, the dry ice is in contact with many potential contaminants that can be hazardous to your health.For many applications, these contaminants are not hazardous as the items that are being kept cool will not be consumed.   If you are using the dry ice to keep your food cold, make sure that you get food grade dry ice that is contaminant free. Food that comes in direct contact with the dry ice is perfectly safe and can be consumed without worry. As dry ice warms up, it turns directly in the gas carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is what gives the fizz to a sodaand is perfectly safe to consume in these small amounts. Do not put dry ice directly into drinks or food that will be consumed as this can cause severe burns to the mouth and throat., Dry ice is much colder than the temperature of your freezer or refrigerator. If possible, avoid having the food in direct contact with the dry ice, particularly in the refrigerator. Wrapping the dry ice in newspaper also adds an extra layer of insulation that can make the block last longer.Dry ice will freeze any food it comes in direct contact with.  If you lose power and you don’t want to lose all of the food in your refrigerator, dry ice is the best way to keep your food from spoiling. It is particularly useful if you know you will not have power for a few days. The placement of the dry ice is important: in a freezer, the dry ice should be placed above the food. When using dry ice in the refrigerator, place the block at the bottom of the freezer.Do not put dry ice in a functioning freezer or refrigerator. Because the dry ice is much colder than the temperature of the freezer, the freezer will turn off.Avoid placing dry ice near plastic or glass containers as the dry ice can freeze the container and cause them to crack or break., Frozen carbon dioxide sublimates into a gas, skipping the liquid phase. Dry ice must be contained in a cooler, fridge, or freezer that allows this gas to escape. Storing dry ice in an airtight container can lead to a hazardous buildup of gas and can be an explosion hazard. 

wear protective gloves when handling dry ice.  use certified food grade dry ice.  put a piece of cardboard or newspaper between the dry ice and the food.  know the proper placement of dry ice in a freezer or refrigerator.  use containers with loose lids that are not airtight. 

 Gasoline from cars, buses, planes, etc. and CO2 from the coal used in trains also plays a tremendous part in warming the Earth (Global Warming). Simply walking/ taking a bike to school or work. If that's not an option, or if you live where the seasons change, carpool with some buddies. Get your neighbors to carpool to school or work with you. In other parts of the world, it's 5 people to a car everyday. In America, guess how many? 1. One person gets their own car. If every person is driving to the same place, you can only imagine how much we are polluting.; , Those are those decomposable bags that you probably see for sale in Walmart or Walgreens. They can be used over and over and reduce plastic and paper intake used for making those bags at grocery stores. With these bags being decomposable, they are easily recyclable. Feel free to throw them in the recycling bin only AFTER they can no longer hold groceries because there's a hole in the bottom!  , Getting a product's full use out of it will help reduce the need for more. If you continue to use plastic bags at a grocery store, use them as garbage bags! In the bathroom or kitchen sink, they are free with your grocery purchase.  This couldn't be more simpler. Nowadays, everyone has two trash cans: A trash-trash can, and a recyclable trash can. Put plastics (shampoo bottles, soap bottles), aluminum (cans, beer cans), and glass (beer bottles) into the recycling bin.  Old food can go into a bucket in your kitchen, and daily (or once a week) you can empty this is a compost pile in your backyard! Banana peels, orange rinds, left-over rice pasta, all can go into the compost pile! Coffee grounds included, any bones (chicken, ribs, etc.) excluded. Negative: It can smell. Positive: It will give you a wonderful garden come spring!  , Picking up trash around coastlines can keep it from getting in the waters and keep animals safe. Some birds make use it in their nest, and end up killing their baby birds because one of them was picking at a plastic bag. It keeps the ocean clean!  , For more up-front ways to keep oceans safe, petition to use more natural resources on ocean front properties like hotels and businesses. Waste from these places can be flushed into the ocean.  

reduce your carbon footprint!,  when at the grocery store... use green bags.  use things until you can use 'em no more!,  recycle!,  compost!,  pick up trash!,  write a petition! 

 Rest is the first and most important measure for knee sprain. Rest will not only decrease pain but can also prevent further injury to the knee. Consider the use of crutches to keep the weight off your injured knee. However, many doctors say that you should actually not keep your injured knee immobile for too long. You can usually start some exercises to help keep your knee joint moving and mobile. Start these as soon as you can tolerate the exercises without them causing too much pain. Talk to your doctor when you are considering starting exercises. Your doctor may advise you to wear a knee brace to keep your knee immobile for few days until the ligaments heal.; , Ice application is an effective way of reducing pain and swelling caused by a knee sprain. Ice mainly acts by cooling down that area, which can help to reduce blood flow and inflammation.Do not apply ice directly to the affected knee. Instead wrap it in a plastic bag or cloth and then apply it over the affected knee for 15 to 20 minutes every 4 hours.  Compression will reduce swelling and pain. Compression will physically reduce the swelling and enhance blood drainage from that area.Using an elastic bandage, wrap the knee starting from below the knee, and extend the bandage up past the top of the knee. The wrap should not be too tight; otherwise it will cut off circulation to the leg and ankle. Re-wrap the if bandage if it is too tight. Remove the bandage before going to sleep.  Knee elevation will reduce swelling around the joint. This is because when your knee is elevated above your heart, it speeds up the blood drainage in that area. This, in turn, will limit the swelling in that area.Use a pillow to elevate your knee while you are sleeping.  Hot baths, saunas, and heat packs should be avoided for 72 hours. Heat has the opposite effect of ice when it comes to blood flow; it actually encourages blood flow rather than slowing it down.However, after 72 hours, no further inflammation is likely to develop and heat may then be soothing to your painful knee.  Alcoholic drinks can increase bleeding and swelling and decrease healing, so alcohol should be avoided for first 72 hours after a knee sprain occurs., Running may cause further damage. Try walking after two to three days. Stop walking if you feel pain.  A massage may be soothing after 72 hours when inflammation has subsided. However, if you massage your knee before 72 hours has passed, it could increase blood flow to the area and cause swelling. 

rest your knee for the first 48 hours after injury.  ice your knee for two to three days following the injury.  compress your knee using a bandage.  elevate your knee above heart level.  avoid heat for the first 72 hours following the injury.  stay away from alcoholic drinks.  do not run on your sprained knee.  don’t massage the knee until 72 hours have passed. 

 You can slice in rounds or lengths; the preference is yours but round slices tend to be easier to handle.; ,   Drain after 10 minutes and leave to one side for later use.  Add the pepper powder to beaten egg and whisk gently.   Dip the eggplant slices into the egg batter.  Place the breadcrumbs into a wide bowl or flat plate and lay the slices direct into the breadcrumbs, and then turn over to coat the other side.   Lay on a tray or plate while waiting for frying. Keep this tray or plate close to the stove top for ease of use. ,, Eggplant fritters can be eaten and served in many different and creative ways. They can be served as a meal of their own, accompanied by salad and vegetables, or they can be served as a side dish.   They make great snacks. Pickles, flavored mayonnaise, and sauces go well with eggplant fritters. Serve with vegetables as a delicious vegetarian meal when vegetarians turn up without warning.  

slice the eggplant into 3 mm (1/8 of an inch, or 1/3 of a cm) thick slices.  soak in salted water for 10 minutes.  beat the egg with a quarter teaspoon of fine salt.  coat the dipped slices with the breadcrumbs.  fry the coated eggplant slices in oil until golden brown in color.  ,  drain the oil off each fritter on wax paper, kitchen towel, or cardboard.  ,  serve. 

 One of the most obvious signs of diabetes is excessive drinking. As high glucose levels lead to dehydration, your dog will need to drink more and more water. A dog with diabetes will drink a lot more water than usual.As a result, your dog will start urinating more. Often times, pet owners will notice that their dog starts urinating in the house or in its own bed.  Do not limit the dog's water intake. Your dog needs the amount of water it is drinking to keep itself hydrated.  A key sign of diabetes is increased lethargy. The dog is tired because the sugar doesn't get taken up into the cells, so the dog runs low on fuel. The resulting sleepiness is known as "diabetes fatigue."  , Long term, diabetic dogs can develop cataracts. In addition, diabetic dogs run the risk of sudden blindness from diabetic retinopathy (a disease affecting the retina at the back of the eye)., Diabetes that isn't treated can lead to further health complications. The vet will want to perform blood tests to see how high the levels of glucose are in your dog's bloodstream and to make sure no other organs have been affected by the diabetes.  There are multiple tests (blood and urine) that your veterinarian will perform to diagnose your dog. Taken alone, any one of these tests cold indicate a wide range of conditions and illnesses, but taken together, they'll let your vet know if your dog suffers from diabetes mellitus.   A urinalysis is a chemical examination of your dog's urine. In the first instance the vet will ask for a urine sample for a dipstick test. If there's no sugar in the urine then diabetes isn't likely. If sugar is present then blood tests are necessary.A blood glucose test will be performed next. This can be done on a single pin prick of blood. Again, if levels are normal then diabetes is ruled out. If the levels are high then a full blood panel is warranted. A CBC evaluates the level of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your dog's blood stream. If the vet finds higher levels of white blood cells, this could indicate a urinary tract infection — common in diabetic dogs. Low red blood count could indicate dehydration. It could also mean that your dog is suffering from ruptured red blood cells. A serum biochemistry profile is taken from a separate blood sample. This test focuses on monitoring sugar levels and other materials in your dog's blood like enzymes, lipids (fats), proteins, and cellular waste. While abnormalities of any kind may indicate diabetes, vets primarily look at the serum glucose (sugar). Normally taken after the dog has fasted, any elevated glucose level likely indicates diabetes. In addition, the vet may order a blood fructosamine test. This gives an overview of blood sugar levels for the preceding two to three weeks. This is significant because a single high blood glucose result is not conclusive for diabetes, as stress can cause temporary elevations. Thus either a blood glucose curve (tracking the sugar levels over the course of 24 hours) or a fructosamine, is advisable in order to confirm the diagnosis.  

see if your dog is constantly thirsty.  notice if your dog sleeps more than usual.  check your dog's eyesight.  visit your vet immediately if you notice these symptoms.  run tests. 

 Change your language about the problems you encounter in life, and you can drastically change the way you handle them. Every problem opens up the doors to reassess, explore new options, and improve existing methods. Therefore, instead of labeling them as problems, think of them as opportunities to improve., If you felt like you had the ability to effectively handle life's problems, you might not become so overwhelmed by them. Once you identify and start using your strengths, you can gain a higher confidence for handling life's problems.   Grab a sheet of paper and list all of the accomplishments, values, and positive qualities about yourself you can think of. Also, call a close friend or family member who knows you well. Ask this person to help you identify your strengths. If you have trouble figuring out your strengths, take a free online assessment like the VIA Character Strengths Assessment.After you have identified your strengths, learn to channel them effectively in your life. Review each strengths and figure out ways that you already use this strength in your life. Then, brainstorm additional ways you can use this strength to your advantage., Having gratitude about the good things in your life, or the previous problems that you were able to overcome, can help you cope with the present issues you are facing. To practice gratitude:Start a gratitude journal by writing out a few things that went well during each day. Say "thank you" more. Write gratitude letters to your family, friends, and acquaintances who have been a help to you in some way. Transform your language to use these words more "gifts", "fortunate", "blessings", and "abundance".  

start viewing problems as opportunities.  channel your strengths.  cultivate gratitude. 

 An unbonded screed sits on top of plastic sheets instead of directly on the concrete below. This protects your floor from moisture in the subfloor, and from settling and other issues in the main structure. However, unbonded screed is more likely to curl. Reinforcing can help with this problem, as described below.   Due to the risk of curling, an unbonded screed should be at least 50mm (2") thick at all points. This means pouring a layer at least 70mm (2.75") thick to allow for variations on the sublayer.; , Remove all dust and grease from the concrete before you begin the project.  Lay down polyethylene or PVC sheets to separate the concrete from the screed layer. Overlap sheets by at least 20 cm (7.9") and tape them together. Fold the sheets up 10 cm (3.9") onto all walls and pillars.  This protects these surfaces from damage when the screed shrinks. You may use edging foam, 20mm (0.8") kingspan insulation, or 1 cm (2.5") polystyrene., Unbonded screed is at greater risk of micro cracks, which reduce its strength. Reduce this risk with one of the following approaches:Mix polypropylene fibers into the screed mix before adding water (or order ready-to-use screed with polypropylene already added). Alternatively, position crack control steel mesh over your subfloor so it will sit in the top half of your screed. If you do not plan to reinforce unbonded screed, it's a good idea to make the screed at least 100mm (3.9") thick.Screed this thick suffers from moisture issues, so consult a contractor about alternative mixes., Once your workspace is ready, skip down to the section below to see instructions for mixing and applying the screed.  

learn the pros and cons.  clean the concrete base.  cover the floor in plastic sheeting.  line walls and pillars with compressible material.  reinforce the screed.  screed the floor. 

 The warp and weft threads must be approximately the same (this means fabric with and even, symmetrical weave). Heavy linen with coarse regular weave is ideal because it ensures that you can count the threads easily., While traditional Hardanger embroidery is white worked on white, today's range of fabric colors and threads open up a wider possibility of color choices.  Hardanger is not hard but it must be accurate. Counting the threads is the most important part of Hardanger embroidery. One mistake will ruin the pattern and make it necessary to start the work all over again.  The stitches used in Hardanger are the Kloster blocks stitch (satin stitch) for solid sections of the designs and under-and-over woven bars (or wrapped bars) for the cut and drawn pieces.   The Kloster block stitches are arranged to outline the cut spaces - it is these stitches that construct the major parts of the design.Additional stitches that may be used include: eyelet, back stitch, lace stitch, and fagoting.  Prior to mounting the fabric for a Hardanger project, given that the fabric may have a tendency to fray as you stitch it, overcast it first on all of its cut edges.  Make your design on paper first. By necessity, Hardanger stitches will be geometric in shape, taking on the forms of squares, triangles, oblongs, diamonds, rectangles, etc.While the outer edges of the larger designs will appear very straightforward, it will be the smaller shapes developed around the larger ones that create the textual contrasts and provide the interest to your Hardanger piece.  That way, the Hardanger decoration will be exactly in place.  A pointed needle will split the threads and make accuracy impossible.  Start a thread by placing a few stitches into the fabric and covering these with the embroidery stitches. Fasten off threads by running back on the underside of the fabric.  Try making little Hardanger embroidery squares or diamonds on a sampler. This way, you will become familiar with the work of counting threads and mistakes will be easy to remedy.  

select fabric that has counted threads.  choose a fabric color that suits your needs.  pay careful attention to accurately counting the threads.  learn the stitches used for hardanger.  prepare the fabric well.  plan ahead.  place a basting line on the exact spots where the hardanger embroidery will be placed on clothing and cloth items.  use a needle without a point with a large eye.  get used to the feeling that you do not use knots in hardanger embroidery.  practice on small pieces when beginning. 

 Order some of an item at 99GP, some at 97GP and some at 95GP. If the price goes up and you flip the item, you'll make a bigger profit overall.  Set orders starting at 5 percent below the GE price. Slowly increase your offer until someone bites. You'll find out the floor price for which others will sell the item, and you'll save GP.  Set your price at 5 to 10 percent percent above the GE price. Then, drop it gradually until someone makes the buy.  For example, buy 1 lobster and test the price instead of buying 100 lobsters before you know the direction that prices will go.  Most people will set prices on even numbers, like 20,000GP. If you set your price at 19,997GP, you'll beat their offer. If you're lowering your offer on an item that you want to sell, always lower it in odd increments.  If you have enough extra GP and one of your items starts to free-fall in price, then make a huge order for the item to stop the price from decreasing. Then, when you've cornered the market, sell your items gradually to avoid causing the price to drop dramatically again.  Don't always try to guess what the hottest item will be. Get to know 2 or 3 items and become familiar with their price ranges. For those items, you'll be able to spot a good deal quickly.  When you invest in a certain item at 150GP, keep buy orders in the exchange at 140GP and sell offers at 180GP. When your buy or sell offer hits, you'll be able to predict the path that prices are headed, and you can decide whether to sell out quickly or whether to keep buying.  Choose an item that will go higher in price on the GE site. Buy it between -5% en the GP price. Now wait a little bit. When the items are loaded, you can put it on your bank for 2 or more days. Sell it at GP between the GP price and the +5% price. Wait and take your profit. Good luck!  

use price averaging.  buy high-value items below price.  sell high-value items above price.  buy single commodities to test prices.  use odd pricing.  set a price floor.  specialize in a few items.  set a hedge.  flip. 

 What do you want your readers to feel at different points during the story? How should they feel when they finish reading? How do the characters in the story feel about what is happening?  , While you may have never been through exactly what your character deals with, chances are you've felt happy, sad, angry, surprised, scared, and a whole host of other emotions before. Think back to the last time you felt the particular emotion you're trying to get across. What do you remember thinking and doing?  , Your own emotions are a good starting point, but in most cases, your characters aren't the same as you. Think about the type of person your character is and what he or she would do when faced with the situation you're writing about.   If you're having trouble imagining your character's reaction, try writing down how you think you would react in the exact same situation, what you would think, say, and do. Then, go over each part of your reaction and ask yourself "Would my character do this?" Even if the answer is "no," this exercise may give you a better idea of how your character would react by making it clear what he or she wouldn't do and why. If you're still stuck, go through the same process but use different characters - yours or someone else's - in place of you.  If you just write "Sam was happy," your readers aren't going to be moved. It will help if they know why Sam was happy, but that's still not enough detail to make readers feel Sam's happiness too. If you were standing next to Sam, how would you know that he was happy? What does his face look like? What is he doing? Is he talking? If so, what is he saying and how does his voice sound? Specific details will make your readers feel like they are seeing how a particular person expresses happiness in this particular situation, not just being told that someone is happy.  What you describe about the area where the action is taking place, the objects in that setting, and even the other characters can help to enhance the emotion of a scene. Remember that you and your readers are seeing everything through the eyes of your main character and the main character's emotional state will influence what he or she notices and thinks about. You don't have to have it rain during a sad scene or set a happy moment in a beautiful, comfortable room. A truly happy character may fail to notice the dull grey walls around her or even find them beautiful, while a miserable person could be unswayed by the most pleasant weather.   Another writing exercise you can try is to describe or find a picture of an environment, that write scenes where your character enters the room while feeling happy, sad, frightened, angry, tired, or whatever emotion you would like to explore. See how you can use the same set of details in the environment to convey how your character feels in each scenario.  

identify the emotions in your story.  think about a time when you experienced the emotion your character is experiencing.  decide how the character would react.  be specific.  use the setting. 

 The first step to becoming a good boss in a particular role is having an excellent understanding of the job and what is needed to be successful.   Without significant experience, obvious mistakes will be made and the boss's judgment will be questioned by subordinates. Therefore, it is important to define what qualifications your ideal candidate needs to have in order to understand and do the job successfully. For example, a sales manager should have several years of experience in sales and a strong understanding of the sales cycle and selling techniques. A sales team will not follow a sales manager if the sales manager has significantly less experience than other members.; , All teams run slightly different, even within the same company. In order to determine what type of manager the team needs, you should evaluate team’s role, how long the team has been doing the same job, how members interact and how they are motivated.   Understanding how the team operates and what works best for them will allow you to find a boss with a management style that suits the team. When a team and their boss work well together, the team will be more successful as a whole. For example, if the team has been working together for 3 years, maintains good communication and its members can make decisions independently, you will be best hiring a boss that can be more democratic and work with the team to devise the best course of action in a given situation. A strict micro-manager in this circumstance will demotivate the team and should not be hired.  It is important to understand your company culture so you can evaluate if a potential hire will fit in. Company culture includes, amongst other things, values, beliefs, norms and habits. It is the potential boss’s personality and characteristics that will determine if they are a good fit for the company culture. For example, determine what type of personality will thrive in your company by asking the following questions:   Is the company laid back or fast paced? Is the company fun or serious? Does the company encourage new ideas from all employees? Does your company encourage professional development?  , Once you understand the type of boss you are looking for, place these qualifications and characteristics into the job posting. #*Be as specific as possible in the job posting writing, as this makes it more likely that the right candidates will apply for the job. Most importantly, you will have less of the wrong type of candidate apply for the job.   For example, a sample job posting could be "sales manager with over three years of sales management experience, with proven ability to motivate sales professionals in a very fast paced environment."  , Asking for specific examples of the candidate’s experience will probe deeper into a person’s capabilities. It will also give you the opportunity to judge if this person is telling the truth about the extent of their experience.   The best way to do this is to ask open ended questions such as, “Can you tell me about a time when you led your team to exceed sales goals?”  , When speaking to a candidate, ask them questions to determine if they would be a strong leader such as:   Can you provide examples of your leadership abilities and successes with your previous team? Explain your experience coaching and mentoring others? Have you conducted training in the past? If so, what kind and how? How do you motivate others to be successful?  , Throughout the interview, ask yourself a number of questions in order to evaluate whether this candidate is right for the position:   Does this person have necessary skills to be a leader? Can they grab my attention? Are they confident? Can they communicate clearly? If the combined answers lead you to believe this person is a strong candidate, you may have found yourself a good boss.  A good leader should have excellent communications skills. This means that person will be able to express themselves clearly and provide direction to others, with little room for interpretation.   A great communicator must be able to communicate well across all mediums so it is important to assess their communication skills during every interaction - including over the phone, in person or by email.  Try to determine if the candidate's management style will fit the team’s needs. Management style can be difficult to assess in an interview scenario, so the best thing to do is just ask the candidate directly.   For example, “How would you describe your management style?” and “Can you provide examples of how you utilized this management style to meet or exceed your team’s goals?”  , During all communications with the candidate, try to develop an understanding of their personality traits. Examples of positive personality traits include optimistic, trusting, humorous, understanding and encouraging. Then, ask yourself the following questions:   Will this person fit in well with the team and the company? Does their personality match well with company culture? Can you see yourself working with this person? Do you feel team members will be able to take direction from someone with this personality?  , Hiring a boss can take some time, and the higher the level of employment, the longer it can take to find the right person. Good bosses or managers can be hard to find because you are looking for a unique set of skills and abilities to do the job and lead a team to success.   One person may be able to do the job successfully but cannot lead their team to be successful. Another person may be an exceptional leader but lack the subject knowledge necessary to do the job. Always take your time in finding the right candidate. Making the decision too quickly might result in hiring the wrong person, and this could have a negative effect on your team. The perfect boss for your team is worth waiting for.  

define the job duties and qualifications.  determine the type of manager the team needs.  know your culture and who will fit in.  set specified qualifications in the job posting.  ask for examples of experience and track record of success.  evaluate leadership abilities.  throughout the interview, evaluate the candidate's strengths.  assess the candidate's communication skills.  ask them to describe their management style.  gauge the candidate's personality.  be patient - do not rush the decision. 

 The rosary is said by traveling around the loop of beads, stopping at each one, and saying a prayer. Typically, if someone is going to say the whole rosary, rather than just a section of it, s/he starts with the crucifix at the "bottom"., This prayer is a statement of Christian belief, one that essentially summarizes the things that all Christians believe, including the existence of God, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, and the Resurrection.   The words of the Apostles' Creed are: "I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord: Who was conceived by power of the Holy Spirit, born of the Blessed Virgin Mary; suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried. He descended into hell; the third day He rose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven, is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen."  When Protestants say the Apostle's Creed, they usually change the meaning of the word "Catholic" in the line "I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints..." to reflect the concept of universality, rather than the actual earthly institution of the Roman Catholic church.  Take the next bead in your fingers and say the Lord's prayer (also called the "Our Father"). This prayer was passed directly from Jesus to his disciples as a way of expressing devotion to God in heaven.The words of the Our Father are: "Our Father, Who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come, Thy Will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen."   , Next, say one Hail Mary for each of the next three beads, taking each bead in your fingers as you begin each prayer in succession. Traditionally, among Catholics, these 3 Hail Marys are offered to obtain an increase in the virtues of Faith, Hope and Charity and for the intentions of the Pope.   The words of the Hail Mary are: "Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen."  Some Protestants are hesitant to say the Hail Mary because it is offered to Mary, rather than God or Jesus. Though it's up to you to decide whether you want to say the Hail Mary or not, the many arguments put forth by members of the Catholic Churchand various Protestant churchesregarding the prayer's biblical basis may help you come to a decision.  If you're reluctant to say the Hail Mary, know that some Protestant churches have their own versions of the rosary that omit this prayer.  The Doxology (also called the "Glory Be to the Father" or "Gloria Patri") is a short hymn of praise exulting God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit.   The words of the Doxology are: "Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is now, will be for ever. Amen."  Often, if the Holy rosary is made from string, rather than chain, the Doxology will be marked with a thick or knotted section.  This bead, which is usually a large and/or decorative medallion, marks the beginning of the first "decade" of the Holy rosary. The Holy rosary is divided into five decades, each composed of ten Hail Marys and separated from each other by Our Fathers.  After the central bead, move counter-clockwise to the first group of ten beads. Say one Hail Mary for each bead in the decade, moving along the length of beads as you go.   Note that many people say a single decade of the Holy rosary as a "short version" of the Holy rosary when they don't have time to say the entire Holy rosary.  Optionally, you can also add the Fátima Prayer or/and the prayer for priests at this point; this is done without moving along the beads.   The words of the Fátima Prayer are: "O my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of hell. Lead all souls to heaven, especially those in most need of Thy mercy."  The words of the prayer for priests are: "O Jesus, our great High Priest, hear my humble prayers on behalf of your priests. Give them a deep faith, a bright and firm hope and a burning love which will ever increase in the course of their priestly life. In their loneliness, comfort them. In their sorrows, strengthen them. In their frustrations, point out to them that it is through suffering that the soul is purified, and show them that they are needed by the Church; they are needed by souls; they are needed for the work of redemption."   , You have successfully completed the first decade of the Holy rosary. Now, continue along the Holy rosary's beads, following the pattern of the first decade for each subsequent decade - one Our Father for the first bead, followed by a Hail Mary for each of the following ten beads, followed by a Doxology. Work your way along the rosary in this fashion until you have gone all the way around the chain of beads and are back at the large central bead.  The Salve Regina is a hymn extolling the Blessed Virgin Mary similar to the Hail Mary. When you finish, make the Sign of the Cross to finish the Holy Rosary. Congratulations - you're done!   The words of the "Salve Regina" Hail Holy Queen or are: "Hail Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy, our life, our sweetness, and our hope. To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve; to thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this vale of tears. Turn then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us, and after this, our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary! Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God, that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ."  Catholic tradition dictates that, if you like, you may add any prayers at the end of the Holy rosary that you like. These can be "official" prayers like the Our Father and Apostle's Creed or personal, improvised prayers from the heart.  The Holy rosary is not just a prayer tool - it's also a way to reflect on important events in the lives of Jesus and Mary. Many serious Catholics choose to do so by reflecting on certain sets of mysteries as they pray the Holy rosary. Each set contains five mysteries grouped according to certain emotional themes. Individual mysteries are events in the life of Jesus and/or Mary that are taken from the Bible. Each mystery is associated with a certain religious virtue or "spiritual fruit" (e.g. charity, patience, etc.). By reflecting on these mysteries, someone who prays the Holy rosary can work to strengthen his or her personal relationship with Jesus and and Mary, meditating on each event and the spiritual fruit associated with it. Note that not everyone who says the rosary chooses to do this, but anyone can.   There are currently four sets of mysteries. The fourth mystery was added by Pope John Paul II in 2002; the others are centuries old.The sets of mysteries are:  The Joyful Mysteries The Sorrowful Mysteries The Glorious Mysteries The Luminous Mysteries (added by Pope Saint John Paul II in 2002)    , To say the rosary in observance of one of the sets of mysteries, the person saying the rosary proceeds as normal from the crucifix through the first few beads. When s/he reaches the first decade, s/he meditates on the first mystery as s/he prays the Our Father, the ten Hail Marys, and so on. Upon reaching the second decade, s/he meditates on the second mystery as s/he prays. The person saying the rosary proceeds through the rosary in this fashion, reflecting on a different mystery for each decade. Each set of mysteries contains five mysteries - one for each decade of the rosary.   Traditionally, a person reflects on a different set of mysteries for each day of the week. Below are more detailed instructions for each set.  The Joyful Mysteries are happy events in the lives of Jesus and Mary. These events occur fairly early in their respective stories - two even take place before the birth of Jesus. The Joyful Mysteries and the spiritual fruits associated with each are listed below:   The Annunciation: Humility The Visitation: Charity The Birth of Our Lord: Poverty, or Detachment from the world The Presentation of Our Lord: Purity of heart; Obedience The Finding of Our Lord in the Temple: Piety  , The Sorrowful Mysteries are sad events in the lives of Jesus and Mary (especially Jesus). These events are centered around the death of Christ by crucifixion. The Sorrowful Mysteries and the spiritual fruits associated with each are listed below:   The Agony in the Garden: Contrition for our sins The Scourging at the Pillar: Mortification of our senses The Crowning with Thorns: Interior mortification The Carrying of the Cross: Patience under crosses The Crucifixion and Death of Our Lord: That we may die to ourselves  , The Glorious Mysteries are events associate with the resurrection of Christ and the entry of Jesus and his mother into heaven. The Glorious Mysteries and the spiritual fruits associated with each are listed below:   The Resurrection: Conversion of heart The Ascension: A desire for heaven The Coming of the Holy Ghost: The Gifts of the Holy Ghost The Assumption of our Blessed Mother into Heaven: Devotion to Mary The Coronation of our Blessed Mother: Eternal happiness  , The Luminous Mysteries are the most-recently created mysteries, having been added to Catholic tradition in 2002. These mysteries are events from Jesus' adult life and ministry. Unlike the other sets of mysteries, the Luminous Mysteries are not necessarily close to each other chronologically - while, for instance, the Sorrowful Mysteries all take place in sequence during a single short period, the Luminous Mysteries do not. The Luminous Mysteries and the spiritual fruits associated with each are listed below:   The Baptism of Jesus in the Jordan: Openness to the Holy Spirit, the Healer. The Wedding at Cana: To Jesus through Mary. The understanding of the ability to manifest-through faith. Jesus' Proclamation of the Kingdom of God: Trust in God (Call of Conversion to Messiah) The Transfiguration: Desire for Holiness The Institution of the Eucharist: Adoration

 Often times couples that have been together for a long time take the things that are said for granted. For example, your spouse might tell you that something you're doing has been bothering him/her, but you might assume that it's not a big deal because you've been together for so long. However, little things add up, and when your partner feels invalidated or unheard, that can lead to bigger trust and intimacy issues down the line.If your spouse tells you there is a problem, you need to take that statement seriously. Work on solving the problem, either alone or together, but make sure you take your partner's concerns seriously. Address your partner's needs. If your spouse is telling you what he or she wants from the relationship, you need to put in the effort to make it happen or work together to find a compromise.; , Quality time is time that you reserve unconditionally and completely for your spouse. No matter what happens, you should reserve this time for your spouse. Phone rings? Hang up and shut it off in front of your spouse. Listen to each other, sit together, watch each other. Enjoy each others presence and enjoy being together. Do this at least once a week for 30 - 60 minutes., Honesty is tremendously important in a relationship, especially if you're married. You want to feel that you can trust your spouse, and you want your partner to feel the same way. But honesty and openness extends beyond just telling the truth; it also means not withholding information, and not holding back when there's something you want to address.Never lie to your partner. Even a small lie, like saying something doesn't bother you when it secretly does, can eventually boil over into resentment and arguments. Open up and let yourself be vulnerable with your partner. Tell your spouse your secret hopes and dreams, your deepest fears, and other things that you keep hidden. Let your partner open up and be vulnerable with you. This can help build trust and foster a stronger sense of intimacy and affection.  Compromising can be difficult, especially when emotions are running high after an argument. However, needing to be right for 30 seconds isn't worth the strain that argument could put on your relationship down the line. It's normal to disagree or even argue from time to time, but you need to be willing to let go of your side in the name of compromising and collaborating.   Don't think of arguments as something that need to be "won." This is dangerous thinking, as it pits you and your spouse against each other.Let go of things that aren't worth fighting over. Even if you weren't in the wrong, it's not worth the stress and frustration of an argument. Be willing to cede an argument. Just because you think you're right, it doesn't mean arguing your point any further will get you anywhere, so work on dropping it before it escalates. Compromise makes your relationship stronger. When you both set aside your needs, including your need to be right, you can work together as a team for the betterment of both partners., When you and your spouse have a disagreement, it's important to avoid using accusations or insults. One way many spouses inadvertently hurt their partners is by using "you" statements instead of "I" statements. Using "I" statements can help convey the way you're feeling and promote a productive, positive conversation, instead of hurting your partner's feelings.   A "you" statement conveys blame to your partner. For example, "You're always late, and you make me look bad as a result!" An "I" statement reframes the conversation in a way that focuses on the feeling, not on pinning blame or guilt. For example, "I'm noticing that you are staring away during this conversation and it makes me feel like you're not taking my feelings into consideration." An "I" statement has three components: a concise and non-accusatory description of the specific behavior you're having problems with, your feelings on that behavior, and the tangible, concrete effect your partner's specific behavior has on you.The behavior component should stick to the facts of the situation, your feelings should be directly related to that behavior, and the effect should either specify the consequences or support your feelings on the matter. The goal is to be as specific as possible and stick to the issue at hand. Don't drag up other unrelated issues or feelings, just focus on the tangible effects of the current problem.  Many people begin yelling without even realizing it. When you have an argument, your emotions may be running high, and you might feel very passionately about the thing you're debating. However, yelling at your spouse will only have one of two results: either your partner will yell back, and you'll be screaming at one another, or your partner will become fearful of you. Either way, it's a damaging situation that can put a huge strain on your relationship.It may feel relieving in the moment to yell and let out your frustrations, but your emotions will be running high. You're more likely to say things that you don't mean when you yell, and you won't be able to take back those hurtful words later when you're calmed down. Avoid talking about important things when you (and/or your partner) are upset. Take a walk, or simply excuse yourself from the room for 5 or 10 minutes, then restart the conversation when you're both calm.  Whether you've been married for two years or twenty years, it can easily feel like you and your partner have fallen into a rut. Routines form because they are convenient and they make it easier to navigate your day-to-day life, but falling into ruts and routines in your relationship can slowly kill the romance without you even realizing it.If you usually eat in most nights, try going out for a date night. If you typically make your own separate meals, try cooking a meal for your partner and eating together. Do something exciting together that you and your spouse wouldn't normally do. It doesn't have to be anything crazy, but it should push you both to have fun and get excited together. Take a romantic vacation together, or just plan a fun and exciting day together - even if it just means going to a carnival or an amusement park.  When you and your spouse were dating, you probably flirted with one another all the time. So why did you stop? Most couples get comfortable with one another, which is obviously a good thing. But the downside of getting comfortable is forgetting how to turn on the charm, often because you haven't had to in several months (or even years).Make eye contact. Smile at your partner and act giggly. Use romantic body language, and mimic your partner's body language.Stand facing one another, avoid crossing your arms, and lean in towards one another when you speak.  Physical contact is an important component of intimacy. Physical contact makes you feel desired, and it can make you feel comfortable and closer with your partner. If you're already very intimate and have a lot of physical contact, then keep doing it. If you've lost that part of your relationship, make an effort to bring it back.Physical contact doesn't just mean sex (although many people do consider sex a healthy part of marriage). It can mean holding hands, snuggling, embracing, kissing, or any other kind of affectionate contact. Your partner probably wants physical contact as much as you do, but may be too shy or worried that you don't also want it. Don't stress over physical contact, just initiate it. Your partner will appreciate it, and it will help you both feel closer to one another. Remember that feelings often follow actions. If you put forth the effort and try to make a romantic evening for one another, the romantic feelings will follow., If you've been married for a while, you probably both feel overwhelmed from time to time with trying to balance your work life and your home life. This can be even more daunting if you have kids. But making time for intimacy without any distractions (kids, work calls/emails, etc.) can do wonders to bring back the spark in your relationship, especially if you make it a consistent priority week after week.Spending time with one another, especially with physical contact, often sets the stage for sex and will make you both feel closer to one another. If you have to, schedule time for intimacy and/or sex. Experts advise that even setting aside 30 minutes for some intimate time alone can do wonders for your relationship. Drop your kids off at a babysitter's, or if they're old enough to be out alone you can give them money to go see a movie or shop at the mall. That will buy you some alone time with your spouse. Turn off your cellphones when you're being intimate together. Nothing kills the mood like your partner getting dragged into a long work-related phone call. Intimacy isn't just a one-time thing. You'll need to work hard to make time for it every week, or several times a week, or however often you and your partner need it.  This relates to being honest and open in your communication with one another. Some people are afraid to convey their desires to others, even to a spouse. However, your preferences are nothing to feel embarrassed or ashamed of. Talk to your partner about what your sexual preferences or fantasies are, and ask your partner about his or her preferences. And no matter what you or your partner want, be mutually respectful of one another's needs.Feeling like your sexual preferences aren't being met can make sex unfulfilling, which over time can feel almost like a chore. The best way to mutually enjoy sex is to communicate to your partner what you like or don't like, and ask your spouse to do the same. Be willing to explore new things together in the bedroom so that you and your partner are both having your needs met. Plus, trying new things in general can lend a spark to your relationship, and you might find you both enjoy your new routine. Being respectful of your partner's needs doesn't mean putting yourself in an uncomfortable situation. It's okay to have boundaries and to expect your partner to respect those boundaries.  Some people have the impression that couple's therapy is only for people who are on the verge of divorce. However, that is simply not true. Couple's therapy can help you and your spouse work on communication skills, find ways to feel more intimate, and work through any difficulties that arise in your marriage.There's no shame or stigma in seeing a therapist. Couple's therapy can help you and your partner at any stage of your relationship. If you or your partner experience little to no sex drive after previously having a sex drive, your therapist may refer you to your primary physician to see if there are any medical explanations. Sometimes certain medications can reduce sexual urges or the ability to perform sexually. Other times there may be an emotional reason why a person's sex drive decreases. Be honest and open with your therapist and with your doctor to address any intimacy issues you're experiencing.  A big risk in long-term relationships is taking one another for granted. No matter how much you love and appreciate your spouse, there's always a risk that you might get so accustomed to one another that you forget to be grateful for all that your partner does. If you make an effort to express gratitude, your partner will almost certainly do the same.Say thank you when your spouse does something for you, whether it's cooking a meal, fixing a broken cabinet, or just picking something up for you at the store. Letting your partner know that you appreciate the little things will make your spouse feel appreciated, and your partner will be more likely to continue doing nice things for you (and vice versa) in the future. You could say something like: "It made me really happy that you swung by work today - thanks for doing that. It was good to see you for a few minutes."  , Another facet of taking your partner for granted is forgetting to compliment one another. You may think that your partner knows you love him or her, and that may be true. But nothing brings a smile to your face like hearing that someone finds you attractive and desirable, so work to make one another feel special as often as possible.It doesn't take much to notice your partner. Compliment your spouse on an attractive outfit, a recent haircut, any developments after beginning a new workout routine, and so on. Try to praise your partner for his/her efforts in front of others. Bragging about your spouse's accomplishments when he or she is too shy to can really make your spouse feel loved., As your relationship goes on, you might find that it's harder to make time for a date, or to go out and have a romantic evening alone. This can be particularly troublesome if you have children. But having regular date nights spent alone with your spouse can bring back the excitement and the passion that you felt for one another when you were actually dating, and that passion is important in sustaining a long-term marriage.   Commit to spending the night alone together. Get a babysitter for your kids, or have them sleep over at a friend's house. Choose a romantic restaurant. If you have a favorite place to go or if you can recreate your first date, even better. Get dressed up for one another. Try to impress your spouse as though you were still just dating and not yet married. Take a romantic walk after dinner, or go see a show together. Focus on making it an intimate evening alone together.  In addition to feeling your sexual needs are fulfilled, it's imperative that you feel like your life has meaning and that you've accomplished something. It may come as a surprise, but experts agree that having your own personal goals and accomplishments separate from your spouse can actually strengthen your marriage.When you feel like your own personal goals are being fulfilled, it's easier to devote yourself to your partner. If you're very career-driven, take time for your career. If you're an artist, work on your art. If you're athletic, train for a marathon.No matter what your partner's goals and accomplishments are, it's important for you to have your own goals. You and your spouse should be supportive of one another, and should celebrate each other's accomplishments.  

listen to your spouse.  spend quality time with your spouse.  be open and honest with each other.  work on compromising.  use "i" statements.  never yell at your partner.  change up your routine.  flirt with one another.  increase your physical contact.  make time for intimacy.  convey your sexual preferences.  consider seeing a couple's therapist.  express gratitude for the little things.  take the time to notice your partner.  go on a date with your spouse.  make sure you feel fulfilled. 

 If you have the suburban or nice apartment dream or ambitions to be a traditional business person or manager, then this is probably for someone else, another person.   Zippies received media exposure during the American 1972 Democratic and Republican National Conventions in Miami Beach, Florida, when the term was worn on t-shirts by counter-culture activists and groups working to end US involvement in the Vietnam War.    Eat fancy restaurant leftovers for free -- if you wash a few dishes or something?; , They are found as various youths who have taken up the term and may differ from the earlier groupings. They may interact with other "Zippie tribes" from across the planet and communicate, or just do their own versions as a group or individual life style.  Be an informal computer-geek or technician (in techie culture).Wikipedia:Yuppie:  ,   "There's a new and rapidly spreading cultural virus ripping through the British Isles. The symptoms of those infected include attacks of optimism, strong feelings of community and lowered stress levels. Will their gathering in August at the Grand Canyon be the Woodstock of the '90s?"This is also revealed in the magazine Encyclopedia Psychedelica (EPi), that identified them as "Hippies with zip." EPi says, a zippie is "someone who has balanced their hemispheres to achieve a fusion of the technological and the spiritual. The techno-person understands that rationality, organization, long-term planning, consistency and single-mindedness are necessary to achieve anything solid on the material level. The hippie understands that vision, individuality, spontaneity, flexibility and open-mindedness are crucial to realize anything on the spiritual scale.", They called zippies "Liberalization's Children," and defines one of that subculture as  "a young city or suburban resident, between 15 and 25 years of age, with a zip in the stride. Belongs to generation Z. Can be male or female, studying or working. Oozes attitude, ambition and aspiration. Cool, confident and creative. Seeks challenges, loves risks and shuns fears."

 If the possum is using a structure to get to the plant, make the structure difficult to climb. Wrap galvanized iron sheets around posts and over beams of structures, such as pergolas. This will stop the possum from being able to grip the surface with its claws.   This also requires ensuring that there are no trees or shrubs next to the structure that allow the possum to ease itself down from. You can also use a plastic garbage can with the bottom cut off and a slit up the side. Put it around the trunk of a tree so that the possum is unable to climb up the tree.You can wrap sheet metal around the trunk of the tree to make it difficult to climb.You can also place thick netting around the trunk. The netting will catch the possum's feet and discourage them from climbing.  Branches should be far enough away from fences and structures so that a possum can't jump to them.This, in combination with blocking access to climbing the trunk of the tree, will give you the best chance of saving your tree from being decimated.   The good news is that while possums can jump, they can't jump very far.An agile, young possum can jump approximately 2.5 meters from a fixed, stable base but less than 2 meters from a swaying tree branch.This means that trimming your trees so they are more than 2 meters from your garden fence or other structure should be sufficient.  In particular, you should place netting over these plants while they are sending out new growth shoots or are bearing fruit. The netting will not keep possums out completely but they should make it difficult enough for the possums that much of the fruit will be saved.   Also remove any fallen fruit below fruit trees or bushes. Fallen fruit will attract possums to the area, so keep it to a minimum if you can.  This method only works if your garden is closed in with fencing, as it stops possums from climbing over the fence. It will take about one day of your time to install this protection.   Attach a large PVC pipe running horizontally across the top of all of the fencing. This will be hard for the possum to grip onto. Then apply non-toxic grease to the PVC pipe. When a possum now tries to get into your garden, you should find that it cannot get a secure grip or footing because of a the grease on the drum. This causes the animal to fall off without injury. Make sure that there are no holes or other points for the possum to cross the fence.  

make it hard for possums to climb structures or plants.  trim trees that are being eaten.if a possum is eating the new growth off a tree, you need to figure out how to block its access to the tree.  put netting on fruit bushes and trees.  place a greased pvc pipe on top of your fence. 

 There are two changes to look for here. The more obvious one is that if your man is seeing someone else, he may not be excited about sex anymore. If your sex life has been dwindling for a while, then not having much sex doesn’t mean your man is cheating, but if he used to be excited about getting into bed with you and isn’t anymore, it may be a sign that he’s getting it elsewhere.   Another change you may notice is that suddenly your man has an insatiable sexual appetite. This may mean that his sex drive has become more intense because he’s sleeping with another lady. See what he’s like in bed. Is he suddenly much more adventurous than before? Has he always stuck to the same routine and is he now trying to spice things up every time you get into bed? He may be getting his moves from another woman. You should also see if he’s suddenly shy with his body around you and doesn’t want you to see him with his shirt off. If he only wants to have sex in the dark, then it may be because he does not feel right about sharing his body with two women.; , He may be much nicer to you because he feels guilty for being unfaithful. If he’s been distant or uncommunicative, or if he just isn’t a very demonstrative person, but he’s suddenly being very kind and sweet, and always telling you nice things, then it may be because he’s trying to compensate for seeing someone on the side.   But then again, he could just be being nicer because you are going through a rough patch and he is trying to make it up to you. If he suddenly brings you flowers, chocolate, and sweet cards, he could just be trying to be bringing back that loving feeling. Alternatively, he may be compensating for cheating.  If your husband is not normally too handy around the house, but now he’s doing the dishes, doing the grocery shopping, or even doing the cooking, then something may be up. He’s certainly trying to compensate for something, and it may be cheating.   But again, maybe he’s just trying to be nice suddenly, or wants something else from you as a result. Still, when he completely changes his household habits, you should be on the alert.  If your man is usually moody and is suddenly walking on sunshine, or if he’s normally stable and now goes through erratic ups and downs, then something may be up. If he’s grinning ear to ear and looking off into the distance like he’s thinking of someone else, then his good mood may have nothing to do with you.   Also, look out if he storms home and looks upset, and then tries to blame it on work or something that never made him upset before. If you see his mood change after he takes a “quick phone call” or reads a text, then another woman may be the reason.  If he used to leave his phone out on the table for hours, or if he was the type of man who would leave the house and forget his phone all the time, but suddenly he and his phone are inseparable, then something may be up. If he never leaves his phone out anymore, panics when he can’t find his phone, and doesn’t check his texts around you or just acts every shady around his phone, then you may have reason to worry.   If he suddenly put a password on his phone but never cared for privacy before, then something may be up. If he steps out to take a phone call and comes back looking either upset, excited, or apologetic, you may start to wonder who’s on the other line. If you walk in when he’s on the phone and he abruptly ends the conversation, then he may be talking to another woman. If he used to be diligent about answering his phone, and now you can go hours without getting in touch with him, then he may be spending that time with another woman. If he shuts off his phone for hours and he never used to do that, it is not a good sign.  If he never cared for the computer much before, but is suddenly spending all of his time online, it may be because of another woman. If he stays up late on the computer after you’ve gone to bed suddenly, or if he abruptly shuts his computer when you walk in, it’s a bad sign.   If you see him on the computer, and his face suddenly lights up, as if he’s talking to a crush, then it may mean he's cheating. If he does not go on the computer when you are in the room, then he may not want you to see what is on the screen.  If you and your husband spent most of your free time together, and he's suddenly never around for suspicious reasons, then he may be spending his time with another lady. If he's always having a "guy's night," spending every night late at work, or has suddenly found a passion for a new sport and is spending all of his free time at the gym, then he may be using these excuses to get away with his mistress.   Of course, he could genuinely have picked up a love for a new sport, or he may really have to stay late at work every night, but if he's never done either of these things before and has shown several other suspicious signs, then it may mean that he's cheating.  Several things that your man can say may indicate that he is cheating on you. Here are some things to look out for:   If he used to complement you all the time, but never complements you anymore, it may be because he is thinking of someone else. If he wasn't much of a sweet talker before, but is always suddenly complementing you, he may be doing it to compensate for being with someone else. If he just sounds different, using words you've never heard before, laughing in a new way, or just phrasing his words differently, he may have picked this up from another lady.  

look for a change in your man’s sex drive.  see if your man is suddenly showering you with kindness.  see if he is suddenly much more helpful.  look for changes in your man’s mood.  see if he’s changed his habits around his phone.  check out his behavior near his computer.  pay attention to his excuses.  notice what he says.

Know exactly what you're willing to buy before stepping into the store. Your mattress will work just as well without accessories, so don't buy them unless you want to.  

know the different mattress options.  have an understanding of your physical needs.  set your budget before you go shopping.

 People want know that they matter and that they're worth a little extra effort from time to time.   Give a compliment. Express admiration for something about the person. Make your comments genuine and specific. Go one step further and focus on things that are central to their personality "I really admire your courage in that situation" rather that things that are situational "You did a great job of stopping that argument." Lend a hand. There are some dread tasks that we all must face--moving, meeting an impossible deadline, reviving a dead car battery. Making yourself available to help out--even when it's not convenient--can earn you someone's gratitude and affection. Offer support. Freely give you emotional and moral support to someone when they need it. Make them feel valued by always be on their team  , It's not about "buying" someone's affections; instead, giving a token present can express your interest in someone's well-being or let them know that you're in tune with what's happening in their lives.   It really is the thought that counts. When you give someone a little gift, it lets them know that you're thinking of them and that they're important to you. Let your gift reflect life events. A key-chain says, "Congratulations on your new car," a bouquet of flowers can brighten someone's difficult day. Staying focused on what's going on the lives of people you care about can give you ideas for gifts that are meaningful. Make something yourself. You don't have to be a master artist to make a card, decorate a picture frame or bake some cookies. Taking the time to make a gift really expresses your friendship or affection for someone.  While you may have connected with a common interest, chances are you won't share every like, hobby or activity. That's fine....it's good actually because you can get to know a whole other side of a person if you're willing to make a little effort.   Attend an event or learn about your friend's hobby. You don't have to become an aficionado yourself, but being able to talk about it intelligently and with some degree of interest shows your friend that they're important to you. Be willing to learn. If you're open to learning something new, go ahead and be the student. Allowing someone to teach you something makes them feel good about themselves and helps to create a bond between the two of you. Even if someone's passions leave you absolutely bored, refrain from putting them down or making fun of the activity. It clearly means something to your friend; therefore, it deserves your respect.  Unexpected notes, text messages and photo shares can help you stay in touch and create mini-opportunities to connect.   Send a text wishing someone luck before a big exam, important meeting or job interview. They'll appreciate the thought and the support. Snap a photo of something funny and send it on. That little lift can make a difference in someone's day and remind them that you share a similar sense of humor. Don't forget birthdays. Put a note in your calendar to remind you to send a card or give a call on the special day.  

show the other person that he or she is special.  give a small gift occasionally.  take an interest in the other person's hobbies.  leave reminders that you care. 

 We may talk to God as to Dad or recite the prayer given to us by Jesus through His disciples. "Our Father in Heaven, Holy be your name. Your Kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Do not bring us to temptations, but deliver us from all evils.' Please recite, and then follow that as a pattern of one kind of prayer.; , God always want us to live happily and successfully. Cultivate good habits of reading Christian books, watching spiritual programs and helping each other.  Attend Sunday services or masses to give thanks to our Lord, for saving us from all troubles and hardships.  He is all powerful, all knowing and present everywhere including His Spirit being in you. We should thank Him for what we are today. God is Love. He invites us to live at all times in His kingdom life. It is our choice to accept or reject.  Kindly accept His open arms.  Everyone is a part of oneself, even though each lives in a different physical body: we are together in Christ. God's gift of Love brings happiness, success, patience, harmony, peace, integrity, honesty, friendliness and hope.  Failing to be righteous asks oneself to be a failure. We shall overcome all unrighteousness through Jesus who strengthens us. Our Lord has already conquered the world forever.  Meditate on the word of God. Our God lives in us. We should only discover Him in us through Jesus Christ, not by wishing and just by ideas but by His perfect principles.  We shall share our blessings, wisdom, wealth, out of our little or much -- and so, share your faith in many areas and ways. What we give is what is multiplied unto us, pressed down and running over.  Do the same, at least to one who is not family or a loved one, but someone who may live close to you, in turn God brings many, even millions, to inspire you.  What you speak may be different to what you hear. So we should consider and co-operate to understand each others viewpoint to live enthusiastically.  

pray: it is our personal relationship with god.  live as god called us: every man is precious in the eyes of the lord.  follow christ's teachings: the teachings of christ are brought to us in the bible and by our churches.  honor our god: praise, thank and give to our fellowman and so to god.  love your neighbors: we love ourselves when (while) we love our neighbors.  stick to good and to righteousness: do good by being good (in christ's ways), in itself is a great thing.  read the bible: spend 5 to 10 minutes everyday to understand the life of jesus and the love of jesus in our everyday living.  share your gifts: jesus gave his life for us, a gift of salvation for us.  encourage our fellow man: we motivate, we inspire, strengthen and encourage.  co-operate with others: what you say may be different to what another may think.

 Stand in front of the mirror and look at your scrotum. If you have a hydrocele, at least one side of your scrotum will be larger than it normally is.If you are trying to determine if an infant is suffering from a hydrocele, the procedure will be similar. Look for swelling in the testicles. The swelling may be on either or both sides of the testicles.; , Often, a hydrocele will feel like a fluid-filled sac inside the scrotum.

Inside the scrotum, you will feel the testicle, and if there is a hydrocele, you will feel a second lump that feels like a soft, fluid-filled sac. In infants, this sac could be as small as a peanut.Your doctor will do a physical examination and order an ultrasound to diagnose a hydrocele. Your doctor may also perform the flashlight test. If the mass trans-illuminates under exposure to a flashlight, then it is a hydrocele. If it doesn’t then it may be something more serious like a mass or hernia.  The more your scrotum swells, the more likely it is that you will have a hard time walking.Men with this issue have described the feeling as a dragging sensation, like something heavy was tied to their testicles.This is because gravity pulls your scrotum down, but because there is fluid in it that wasn’t there for most of your life, it will feel heavier than normal.   You might also experience this dragging sensation when you stand up after you have been lying or sitting down for a while.  If you do not begin treatment for the hydrocele, your scrotum will continue to swell. If this happens, you might find it hard to put on your regular pants, instead opting to wear baggier pants so that no pressure is put on your swollen scrotum.   If you believe you might have a hydrocele, it is best to have a doctor determine the cause of the problem. Sometimes, a hydrocele is an indication of a hernia, which needs to be treated by a doctor., Normally, you won’t feel any pain while urinating if you have a hydrocele. However, if your hydrocele is caused by an infection in the epididymis and testis (which is referred to as epididymal orchitis) you will most likely feel pain when you go to the bathroom. You should talk to a doctor right away if you begin experiencing this pain. 

look for swelling.  feel for a hydrocele.  pay attention to any difficulty walking that you experience.  monitor any increase in swelling as time goes on.  be aware of any pain you feel while urinating. 

 Start with a gentle facial cleanser for your skin. Look for a cleanser that does not contain alcohol or fragrance. These products can be irritating for dry skin. Use a cleaner that will remove dirt, makeup, and other impurities from your skin without stripping it of moisture.Some people with dry skin find using an oil-based cleanser or a natural cleanser like coconut or olive oil to be helpful. Avoid cleansers that are labeled “scrubs” or “foaming.” These cleansers can end up drying out your skin more. When washing your face, make sure to use warm or luke-warm water. Do not use hot water, as hot water can dry out your skin.; , Next in your skin care regime is a moisturizing ointment or cream. Go for an ointment or cream rather than a lotion, as lotions can be irritating and less effective for your skin. Choose an ointment or cream that contains olive oil, shea butter, or jojoba oil. Ingredients like lactic acid, urea, hyaluronic acid, glycerin, lanolin, mineral oil, and petrolatum can also be good for soothing dry skin.Make sure you apply the moisturizing ointment or cream right after you wash your face. You can also apply it right after you take a shower or a bath. This will help to lock in moisture.  Toners are good for dry skin as they soothe, moisturize, and refresh your skin. You can use toner to remove excess oil and makeup residue on your face as well as flaky or dry skin. Go for a toner that contains salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or hydroxy acid. Avoid toners that contain alcohol, as this can dry out your skin more.Apply the toner with a clean cotton pad, preferably after you wash your face. If the toner starts to sting as you apply it, use less of it as you do not want to irritate your skin more.  Sunscreen is an important part of any skin care regime. If you have dry skin, you should use sunscreen daily to protect your skin from UVB rays, which can dry it out more. Go for a sunscreen that is water-based, as it won’t clog your pore. It will also keep your skin hydrated throughout the day.Apply the sunscreen daily before you put on any makeup or cosmetic products.  To help your dry skin feel moisturized and supple, use hydrating face masks regularly. Try sheet masks, which contain moisturizing ingredients. Or make your own hydrating face mask at home with natural ingredients.Get in the habit of using face masks one to two times a week. Using face masks regularly can help reduce dry patches and irritated skin. Over time, the dryness and redness should start to heal or fade away.  For those with dry skin, using a foundation that is hydrating is key. Avoid pressed powder or powder foundation, as it will dry out your skin more and lead to flaking. Instead, go for a water-based liquid foundation. This foundation can be worn with a moisturizer and sunscreen underneath. It will blend well on your face and will not cause dryness. Water-based liquid foundations also give your skin a nice glow, which can be ideal if your dry skin tends to look dull or washed out.You can also try BB cream or a tinted moisturizer, especially if you do not want to wear heavy makeup on your face. Both options will be moisturizing for your dry skin. Shop for the foundation in person to ensure you find a foundation that matches your skin tone. Speak to a sales representative for help on finding your shade.  If you need concealer to mask blemishes on your face, go for a concealer that is moisturizing. Liquid moisturizers are a good option, preferably a liquid moisturizer that has a wand application for easy use.Read the label of the concealer to make sure it does not contain alcohol or fragrance, as these can be drying. If you have a lot of redness on your face in addition to dry skin, try a moisturizing concealer in a green shade. Green-based concealer can help to counteract redness on your face., If your lips tend to get dry, use a lipstick or lip balm that is hydrating. Look for lipstick that contains moisturizing ingredients like glycerin, shea butter, or jojoba oil. For extra hydration, apply lip balm or lip chap first and then apply lipstick on top of the balm.To help keep your lips moist, exfoliate your lips weekly with a mixture of honey and sugar. Use a clean washcloth to gently exfoliate your lips with the sugar and honey until they feel soft and moist.  You may notice that your makeup looks dry or flaky after several hours of wear. If this happens to you often, invest in a skin refresher that you can carry in your bag. Make your own skin refresher with water and a soothing essential oil like lavender, tea tree, or jojoba. You can also buy skin refresher in a small spray bottle.Apply the skin refresher as needed throughout the day so your skin does not get flaky or dry. A few light sprays every few hours can help your skin to stay moist.  

select a gentle skin cleanser.  go for a moisturizing ointment or cream.  consider using toner.  pick a sunscreen that is water-based.  use hydrating face masks one to two times a week.  use a water-based liquid foundation.  select a moisturizing concealer.  go for a hydrating lipstick.  carry skin refresher with you. 

 Depending on what kind of sea shells you collect at your town beach, you can see those and get bells for them. For instance, a pearl oyster is worth 1,500 bells!; , Sometimes, when you shake trees, 100 bells could fall out! Be careful though, a bee hive could also fall too!  , If you go to a friend's town through Wi-fi or Wireless Communications, make sure you grab some fruit that isn't native to your town. Non-native fruit will sell more than fruit that is already in your town. It's 500 bells for non-native fruit, but only 100 bells for native fruit. Plant one of the fruits you collect, so you can keep selling it in your town.  If you are good at fishing, you can earn a lot of money! You can get some rare fish if you fish a lot. Sell them to Tom Nook. If it's junk like boots, tires, or cans, throw it back or try and sell that too.  With your trusty net, go catch some bugs! Note that, most bugs don't appear in the Winter, and some bugs are only native to one season. If you really wanna press your luck, so around and shake trees. Maybe, bees will come out, and if you are really lucky (and quick), you can catch one and sell it for major cash!  , Look for a crack in the ground. Take out your shovel and dig it up! You can sell up to 3 fossils a day to Tom Nook, so, choose your fossils wisely.  On Sundays, Joan travels into your town to sell White and Red Turnips. Red Turnips sell more than White Turnips. Unfortunately, she only sell one pack of those for 1,000 bells. Get it, then go and plant it. Make sure you water it everyday. If you forget to water on any day, it will have wilted. The price varies on a White Turnip. You can only buy White Turnips in bunches of 10. White Turnips go rotten if you don't sell them buy next Sunday. Now, dig it up at anytime during the week and go sell it to Tom Nook. Depending on what price they are buying them for during the week, you could make more than you spent on the turnips or lose more.  Go to the gate and talk to Booker, to see if has found anything. Most of the time, he finds pretty rare items that you can go sell.  There's a special rock in town that, when you hit it with your shovel, throws out bells! If you do it quickly enough, your could get 8,000 bells at one time! But, if you do if without digging holes around you, you will keep scooting back! And, you'll waste time running back up to the rock. You only have about 6-10 seconds to hit as much as you can. So, here's what you can do. Dig holes around the rock you are going to hit. Make sure you are inside first. Then, hit the rock! If the rock you chose wasn't the one, just turn around and put the dirt back in the hole.  If you have a slingshot, look out for a balloon every time the last digit on the game clock ends in 4. (Ex. 1:04, 1:14, 1:24, etc.). When you have shot it down, open the present and go sell it.  When villagers come by your house on Flea Market day, they could be interested in some of the furniture you have displayed in your house. You could take their offer, or come up with one of your own. You couldn't make it too high, otherwise they won't buy it. Either make it lower than what they offered or about 100-200 bells higher than they offered.  This works similar to the Flea Market, except your friends come over from Wireless Connection or Wi-fi. They can look around at all of your stuff and negotiate a price.  Located in the Town Hall, you could look in the Recycling Bin for items other villagers have left in there.

 Having your boyfriend move a few small items into your house will introduce the idea and routine of living together. Move small items that need to be used daily in order to have the full effect of living in the same space with one another. The more items he eventually brings over to your apartment the easier moving in together will be.Have him bring hygiene products, a change of clothes, and items he might need for work so that he does not need to go back to his house or apartment before starting his day.  The more time you spend together in the same house or apartment the easier it will be to associate that place with home. He will also be able to get an idea of what it will be like to live together by having to share daily space, routines, and chores.Make sure that at least some of the nights he is spending at your apartment are work nights so that he can begin to get a feel for his new routine. Try giving him a task, like DIY repairs or rearranging the furniture, so that he can feel he has an active role in your house or apartment.  Giving him a key will both demonstrate your desire to live together as well as give him unfettered access to your apartment or house. A key might also be needed for more practical reasons, like checking up on your apartment when you are out of town or grabbing something for you before you decide to meet. However, once he has a key, tell him to let himself in when he comes over so that he can get used to using his key. The more he uses the key the more likely he will be associating your house or apartment with home.   If he doesn’t already have a key to your apartment, try to give it to him in a fun or meaningful way, like while on a date or a “special” delivery at work.  

have your boyfriend move a few items into your house.  spend more nights together than apart.  give him a key.

 Don't be afraid to wear bold patterns and of course, loads of sparkly glitter! If this isn't your style, maybe you shouldn't try to dress like CeCe or just buy a couple of outfits like her.; , You totally have to grab yourself some glittery vests, jackets, sweaters, and varsity jackets. CeCe has this one glittery vest that she wears with lots of her crop tops. (You can see it in the episode 'Auction It Up'. She also has some other thin sparkly jackets that she wears (Unzipped of course! Why cover the glamour?) with other fancy shirts. She also wears a white blazer over her crop tops sometimes. White can really pull an outfit together, and CeCe Jones is living proof of it.  Paired with a bold colored tank top underneath,these shirts are fanta-bulous! If you were shopping for CeCe wardrobe, definitely pick up a good supply of tanks and crops, but that would be too monotonous.

 Enter "credit card balance transfer offers" into a search engine. Click on web pages or websites of interest. There are also numerous sites that lay out different offers with their rates and terms in an easily-readable format. When you apply for the cards, just make sure you are doing so on the card issuer's website, rather than through an intermediary.  One important thing to know when searching for balance transfer cards is that you generally cannot transfer balances between cards from the same issuer. This means that you cannot transfer balances between two Bank of America cards. However, this does not apply to payment processing networks, so you can transfer your balance between two Visa cards (provided they are from different issuers)., Each website will list features of their card including transfer processing fee, introductory interest rate, permanent rate, APR (the interest rate after the introductory period), late-payment fee, and annual fee, if any. Your primary goals should be to look for a low introductory interest rate (preferably zero percent) and low balance transfer fees (as close to $0 as possible). In most cases, though, balance transfer fees will be around 4 percent, but some card issuers waive them entirely., Read the fine print on every credit card offer to ensure you pick the card best suited for your needs. You should also read into the balance transfer process to see how exactly it works for the card. For example, the transfer might take two weeks or more to process. During this time, you will still be responsible for keeping up with payments on your old card(s). Check into this delay so that you can make a note to stay on top of your old card until the balance is transferred., Call the credit card company if you have any questions regarding balance transfers. Even if the card you are applying for is not a no-transfer fee offer, you may be able to talk the company down on their offer. Try asking for the minimum transfer fee or no transfer fee. In many cases, you will be able to get the transfer fee reduced by calling., Zero percent interest offers are usually available only for people with good or excellent credit. If your score is low, you may not find a credit card that offers you an attractive transfer option. However, if your credit is low, you may still be able to get a card with an introductory rate of around 7 percent, which can be beneficial if your current card rates are up in the 20 to 30 percent range.Learn how to check your credit score by reading how to check your credit score.  Each person's needs are different. Try to figure out the amount of time it will take you to pay down your transfer balance. Make sure that the introductory rate on any card you are applying for lasts at least that long, so that you can avoid paying high interest rates. In many cases, introductory periods might last 12 to 16 months. Those with great credit might get 18 to 24 months.  However, be warned that longer periods of introductory interest rates often come with higher balance transfer fees and higher regular interest rates., The best way to make sure that you are getting a good deal by transferring you balance is to calculate out all of the potential savings from doing so for each card. This calculation will involve transfer fees, introductory interest rates, regular interest rates, and associated repayment periods. Luckily, there are calculators online that can be used to calculate savings for you. Try searching "credit card balance transfer calculator" into an online search engine to find one. Then, input all of your information as requested.For example, imagine you have been approved for a card with a zero percent introductory interest rate for 18 months. Your current balance is $2,000 on a card that charges 20 percent interest annually. You pay $100 per month towards the card balance.  Even if the card you are transferring to charges a 10 percent transfer fee, a $100 annual fee, and 15 percent interest after the introductory period, you would still save $245.49 in interest by switching cards, assuming you continued your $100 monthly payments.  Before applying for a balance transfer card, assess your financial situation to make sure that you can actually pay down the balance before the introductory period is over. This calculation is simple, as interest will not accrue on your balance (assuming you have a zero percent interest introductory rate). However, if you fail to pay down the card balance during this time, it is possible that you will be hit with a bill for the accrued interest over the introductory period.For example, imagine you have a zero percent interest rate on your new card and an 18 month introductory period. If the balance transferred were $2,700, you would need to make sure you can pay down your balance within those 18 months.   The monthly payment amount required to pay down your balance would be $2700÷18{\displaystyle \$2700\div 18}, which is $150.   In this case, you would need to make sure that you could afford to pay $150 per month to pay down your balance.    , Compare each side by side by lining up their terms in a list or spreadsheet. This will give you better insight as to which card provides you with the most benefits and saves you more money in the long run. For example, you might identify cards with the following terms:  A zero percent interest introductory period of 24 months, 20 percent regular interest rate, 10 percent transfer fee, and $100 annual fee.   A zero percent interest introductory period of 12 months, a 15 percent regular interest rate, 5 percent transfer fee limited to $50, and a $50 annual fee.  No introductory interest rate, regular interest rate of 12 percent, a flat $10 transfer fee, and no annual fee.  The best card will be the combination that provides you with the lowest fees and interest rates while you pay down your outstanding balance. In most cases, there will be a trade-off between interest rates, introductory period length, and balance transfer fees. Calculate the cost of each card's fees and interest rates over the expected repayment period. Then, choose the card that is the cheapest for you.The three cards mentioned in the previous example all have very different terms. The one that you choose to go with will depend on your specific financial situation and repayment capabilities.  For example, the second card would be best if you could pay off your balance within twelve months. However, the other cards may be useful for transfers that would take longer to pay off.    , Some people look for a special introductory rate, which may be enticing; however, use one of these cards only if you are able to pay off the entire, transferred balance within the time frame they give you for interest-free payments. If there is any doubt that you'll be able to pay it off, choose a different card., Failing to research balance-transfer offers thoroughly beforehand can mean that you end up paying additional fees and spending too much money making the transfer. Be clear about balance-transfer fees. Depending on your account balance, that fee can be considerable, which adds to your accumulating debt. Failing to check for these fees can end up costing you more money than you were being charged before transferring your balance., Get pre-approved to make sure that the credit limit on the balance transfer card is high enough to cover all of your transferred debt. If you can't get a high enough limit, you can always apply for more than one balance transfer card. Just keep in mind that the two balance transfer cards you choose must be from different issuers., If you're still between cards, choose the one that comes with additional benefits beyond low fees. Cards may offer travel insurance, payment protection, and points earned on purchases, for example. Benefits should not be the most important criteria when choosing a balance transfer card, but good benefits can mean that the card will be worth using even after you've paid off your balance. 

conduct research using the internet.  avoid cards from your current issuer.  look at the information listed about each card.  don't overlook the details.  ask questions.  know what your credit score is.  assess your balance transfer needs.  calculate potential savings.  make sure you can pay down the balance.  decide on two or three suitable cards.  choose the best combination of fees and interest rates.  be careful with introductory rates.  double-check your choice.  watch out for credit limits.  look for additional benefits. 

 The Common Core presents the concept of subtraction as measuring the distance between two points. To demonstrate this to your students, draw a number line ranging from 0 to 10 on the board as a visual.   Provide your students with a basic subtraction problem: 9-4=?. Locate the number 4 on your number line. This is your starting point. Locate the number 9 on your number line. This is your final destination. Measure, or count the distance between the two points: “5, 6, 7, 8, 9.” The distance is five. Therefore, 9-4=5., When solving a two-digit subtraction problem, explain to your students that there are more stopping points along the way to the final destination.   Provide your students with a two-digit subtraction problem: 73-31=?. Locate the number 31 on your number line. This is your starting point. Locate the number 73 on your number line. This is your final destination. "Stop” at the next tens place. Move from 31 to 40. Measure the distance and write down the answer: 9. "Stop” at the tens place nearest 73. Move from 40 to 70. Measure the distance and write down the answer: 30. "Drive” to your final destination. Move from 70 to 73. Measure the distance and write down the answer: 3. Add together the three measurements: 9+30+3=42. Therefore, 73-31=42., When solving a two-digit subtraction problem, explain to your students that in addition to making extra stops, the distance between the stops will be greater.   Provide your students with a three-digit subtraction problem: 815-398=?. Locate the number 398 on your number line. This is your starting point. Locate the number 815 on your number line. This is your final destination. "Stop” at the next tens place. Move from 398 to 400. Measure the distance and write down the answer: 2. "Stop” at the hundreds place nearest 815. Move from 400 to 800. Measure the distance and write down the answer: 400. "Stop at the tens place nearest 815. Move from 800 to 810. Measure the distance and write down the answer: 10. "Drive” to your final destination. Move from 810 to 815. Measure the distance and write down the answer: 5. Add together the 4 measurements: 2+400+10+5=417. Therefore, 815-398-417.

 Revealing a pregnancy with a clever photo or social media post will get everyone’s attention. Though your grandparents may not be avid social media users, many people in the older generations do use it to keep tabs on friends and family. If you are worried that they may not catch it on their news feed, you can send the picture to them in a private message.Another way to use social media would be to send your grandparents an ultrasound picture.

 Male turtles use their claws during mating rituals with female turtles. They also use their claws to fight and to claim and defend their territory. Therefore, the claws on the males' front legs tend to be longer than the claws of female turtles. Again, this is more obvious when you have two turtles of different sexes to compare with each other.The Red-eared Slider species particularly shows a pronounced difference between the male and female front claws.  Both male and females have an opening or vent located on the underside on the tail. This is called the cloaca, and it is located slightly differently depending on the gender.The female's cloaca is rounder and more star shaped than the male's. It is found much closer to her body, at the base of her tail where it joins her body, almost disappearing into the shell. The male's cloaca is longer and more slit-like. It is located in the last third of the tail, towards the tip.  The male's genitalia are located within the tail, and to accommodate them, the tail is longer and thicker than a female’s. The female's tail is shorter and thinner.Be aware that there is an overlap in normal sizes between male and female, so this can give you a hint, but it is not a foolproof way of sexing a turtle.  The best approach to sexing a turtle is using a combination of the suggested steps to come up with the most likely gender for the turtle. Bear in mind that some methods are less reliable than others in determining the gender of your turtle.  If all the signs point in one direction, then it's more likely than not that you've determined the gender accurately. However, if the signs are mixed, you may wish to take your turtle to a vet to be certain.If you're not sure what conclusion to draw, wait until the turtle is older and try again. It is extremely difficult to sex a baby turtle. Be aware that you might have to wait years until your turtle is fully grown and you can determine the gender effectively.  

examine the turtle’s claws.  look at the turtle’s cloaca.  determine the turtle’s tail size.  combine multiple signs to reach a conclusion. 

  It resembles an egg on end with the rounded end up and the tapered end as the chin. Using pencil, sketch a large egg shape onto a piece of 11 x 14" watercolor paper. Place it in the center and make it smaller than life, but not larger.; ,  This divides the egg into quarters.  Just plot them as ovals or almond shapes for now.   Divide the space from the center or eye line to the chin in half and make a light line. The nose comes off the center vertical line and is symmetrical. For the nose, less is more. It is a triangular shape, but keep it vague and light. The bottom of the nose is a curvy line and will fall approximately at the halfway point between the eye line and chin's bottom. Do the nostrils as light crescents.  The top lip goes above and the bottom lip below this line. The top lip is slightly longer than the bottom one, but the bottom one is plumper. Don't forget the cupid's bow in the center of the top lip. Better a small mouth than one too large, so have the lips stop no further out than the center of the eyes.  They should lie flat on the sides of the head, slightly fuller at the top.  Shoulders drop slightly. Avoid squared-off or boxy shoulders.  It can have the quality of actual hair, straight lines for straight hair, wavy lines for curly hair. Short lines for short hair, lines coming forward for hair over the forehead.  When you are satisfied with them, go back and refine the eyes. Adjust the shape and size of the eyes until they look right. The iris of the eyes are circles, filling almost the entire center of the eye with something like Roman numerals radiating out from the pupil A circle in the center of the iris is the dark pupil. Draw the top eyelid slightly over the top of the iris to cover the white of the eye and partly cover the iris.  Stop when you reach the outside of the eye Draw them with short, feathery strokes, thicker near the nose and tapering off at the ends. Stop where the eye ends. , Remember that the neck is a cylinder, so have collars or necklaces curve around the neck to suggest roundness.  Separate the lighter colored crayons from the pack; white yellow, other very pale shades. Begin to put lines in crayon on the face, clothing and background. You will draw with a lot of pressure to get a build up of wax on the page. If you have trouble seeing what you are doing, all the better, as lots of lines going in many directions in the background and on the clothing will add energy to the finished piece. If this bothers you, switch to yellow until you get your bearings, but go back to white and press hard, getting a lot of wax on the drawing. Scribble, use pressure and let the crayon really play over the paper. Do keep in mind the pencil drawing you've already made of the face and use it as your guide.  This light will make one side of the face glow and the other side will be in semi-shadow.  Select a 3/4" flat brush, load it well and begin to paint.   There is no correct place to start. It can be the face, clothing or background.  Remember your light source, especially on the face. The colors will be repelled by the crayon lines and the results will surprise you, in a delightful way. 

study a face to see the structure of the head, imagining it without hair.  make guide line by running light lines in pencil from top to bottom of the oval and side to side in the middle.  for the eyes, divide the center line into five equal parts and draw elongated ovals, allowing equal spaces on either side and between them.  do the nose.  indicate the mouth with a slightly curved line below the bottom of the nose.  add the ears between the eye line and the mouth line.  start the neck below the ears and tapers inward, curving out again for the shoulders.  draw the hair as it grows from the top and sides of the head.  check the proportions of the face.  go up slightly from the eyes for the eyebrows and have them start at the inside of the eye, angled slightly downward to start, but then arching upward and to the side of the face.  erase the horizontal and vertical guidelines.  ,  draw the clothing, starting with the neck.  add crayon wax.  imagine dramatic side light illuminating the face.  activate your watercolors by putting a few drops of water on each pad, or set up a palette of an array of hues along the edge of a white plastic dinner plate.  cover the entire page, changing colors often, rinsing your brush thoroughly.  finished!  

 Whereas a younger child may not have built up a lot of friends, older children looking for a middle or high school will have important social and emotional factors that affect their well-being. If your child already has a group of friends that have a positive impact on their life, you may want to not break this arrangement up. Also, things like bullying can become more prominent in older children. Find a school that has a strong anti-bullying policy and helps your child build up solid social skills. Finding out what sort of guidance counselor availability a school has can be one important factor in limiting bullying.  Around this age your children will start to be developing interests and schools will have offerings beyond the basics of education like math, english, and writing. Technology courses, foreign languages, and other special offerings can really distinguish one school from the next. Ask to see what electives the school has and sit down to talk to your kid and see how they may align with their interests. It is also a good idea to ask the school specifics about their programs, such as student-to-faculty ration, faculty training, and funding available to support students.  In high school your child may be starting to consider whether they want to continue on to college or pursue a trade. Schools that offer AP classes for college credit, a guidance program for navigating the application process, and even internship options are great for someone looking to continue on to college. If your child is interested in a trade, see if the school has an option to receive hands-on or technical training in various fields. Ask for statistics about where graduate go to college and what sorts of schools they get into. This can give you a general idea how well prepared students are for continuing on to college. See if they have options for students who are advances or excel at subjects. A high school with flexibility and a willingness to challenge students who go above and beyond can be great preparation for academic excellence down the road.  By the time your children reach middle or high school, they may have interests in a particular sport, playing a musical instrument, or perhaps as a budding thespian. Schools that are able to financially support your child's interests outside the classroom can provide a more edifying educational experience and help make them into more rounded maturing adolescents.  While where a school receives its funding does not necessarily make it better or worse than another school, there are differences between public and private schools worth paying attention to. Perhaps you want the structure of a religious education, in which case a private religious based school may be a good option. You'll also want to take into consideration other factors, like whether your child has friends in the community already, how far you are able to drive, and what you are able to financially afford.The main difference between public and private school options is funding. This can play a role in deciding the type of education your child will get. Public schools are funded by the government and thus typically have to follow set curriculums. This will mean it will be largely standardized and have to adhere to certain standards. Private schools do not have to adhere to these and their independence can be a strength. If your child has special needs, public schools are mandated by law to accommodate, whereas private schools will vary from one institution to another. 

take into account social and emotional factors.  take elective offerings into consideration.  ask about their post-graduate planning program.  see what extra-curricular activities they offer.  decide whether you want a private or public school. 

 Before you can position yourself as a super-cool person worthy of envy, you've got to figure out what cool means. Is this the right place for putting on shades and slouching? Is it the right time to talk about the Chocolate Vomits show at which you stage dived last night? Acting cool at work may be a lot different than acting cool in middle school, but you can learn to identify the different cool and uncool crowds, and tailor your coolness accordingly.   In a very large group, like a whole middle school or a whole company, try to find a smaller group of people to befriend and be cool with. Situate yourselves as the "in" group in opposition to the lamestream, er, the mainstream. In a smaller group, it might be more appropriate to remain aloof to play it cool. If you come out too strong, you'll likely just make everyone think you're a weirdo, not cool. Find another cool buddy to be cool with and position your small clique as the in group.; , According to an analysis of "cool kids"one of the traditional markers of coolness is that other people perceive that cool people are more experienced, mature, and knowledgeable than they are. That doesn't mean you need to have spent time under the bleachers, at underground rock clubs, or in foreign countries to give off a cool vibe, nor does it mean you need to start bragging about things you've never done. You can learn to put on a mysterious and experienced act that people will believe.   Practice vague responses to specific questions about your experiences that will seem cool. If someone asks if you're a virgin, or have ever smoked a cigarette, say, "What is this, a sewing circle?" or "That's a boring question" and change the subject. Throw it back in their face. Never make stuff up. It won't make you seem cool to lie and say you've been to Europe, or that you've done illicit things in the back of a car when you haven't. The truth will come out eventually and you'll be exposed and embarrassed.  Acting cool means being different, doing things that make you stand out from the crowd. You're floating above the lame drudgery of the world in your super-cool cloud. You can't be a follower and act cool. Other people should want to be like you, because you're setting trends, surprising people with your fresh outlook and opinions, and bucking the common wisdom.   Play devil's advocate in group discussions and casual conversations. Don't get attached to being right or wrong, just poke at people's expectations and dissent every now and then for the sake of coolness. All your friends ragging on a teacher? Stick up for her. Being different is cool. Alternatively, it may be "cooler" to join up with the crowd in some cases. In middle school, acting cool might mean embracing the newest Justin Bieber song, even if you're not crazy about Biebs. You can still listen to the good stuff when you're alone. But try to be true to yourself.  Let the world come to you. Acting cools means relaxing, not rushing into anything due to uncool excitement. Instead, just chill, kick back, and wait.   Let other people talk first. Practice good listening skills, staying quiet until someone else wants to start the conversation. Acting cool means you're not desperate for chat. Just take 'er easy. Whatevs. Take long pauses before you speak, even if you're fairly sure of what you're going to say. Dramatic pause will give people the chance to contemplate your smarts and your seriousness. Be stoic, like Kathryn Hepburn, Clint Eastwood, and the titans of cool. Don't forget to slow your roll, too. Walk more slowly. Look around, scoping the sites. Smell the flowers. Walk with a cool lope, rather than an efficient bustle.  Uncool people have a tendency to make it their mission to tear down cool people. Cool people from Kanye to Picasso to Yoko all have their haters, and it's lame. If you're going to join the ranks of the super-cool, and start acting like the cool, enviable person with the awesome life that you have, it's a given that you'll attract some haters. Learn to deal with them.   Keep a close watch on your social networking, unfriending or ignoring anyone who hates on your awesomeness. You don't need to listen to it. Instead, surround yourself with people who'll lift you up and support you in your coolness. Prepare cool responses to haters. If someone tries to make fun of the super-hip style you're trying out at school, saying, "What are you wearing?!" have a cool response prepared just in case: "Maybe I should let my mom dress me, like you do." Spread the coolness around and bestow it on others. The bigger your cool clique, the less chance haters will have of effecting you. Build a strong group of cool friends with similar interests so you won't have to be a lone wolf.  One common misconception is that "cool" kids are an exclusive group, like the Navy SEALs, and if one of your friends can't pass the cool test, they'll get cut. A cool person treats everyone with respect and kindness, regardless of whether or not they're really "cool."   Seek out a diverse group of friends. Befriend other kids at your school that aren't necessarily considered "cool" and speak up for them to your friends. Build good will rather than sewing resentment. Some recent studies show that kids considered "cool" in middle and high school end up experiencing functional difficulties in their early adult years, as a result of pretending to have more mature experienced early in life, alienating friends and close ones.Don't make the same mistake as the ruthlessly cool. Keep your real friends around.  

figure out who's "in" and who's "out.",  act like you've been there already.  dissent from the popular opinion of the day.  slow down.  ignore the haters.  make lots of friends and keep them. 

 What you need for a good night's sleep in the car depends on your location, the weather, and what sort of temperatures you are acclimated to. In subzero temperatures, you will probably benefit from a couple of sleeping bags (one inside the other), in addition to a blanket and a beanie for your head.   A $60 sleeping bag will keep you warm in −20 °F (−29 °C) weather outside. In a car, you can get by with a −20 °F (−29 °C) sleeping bag. If it gets colder, then just add an extra layer of clothing to your sleeping attire. Bring a safety pin with you to keep your sleeping bag closed if it does not draw tightly around your head. If you toss and turn in the middle of the night, it could come undone and you could wind up awake and freezing. A knit hat (knit cap, toque, ski hat, and so on) will keep you much warmer at night. Also, you can pull it over your eyes for additional darkness. A sleep mask can help you sleep more soundly. In a pinch, you can blindfold yourself with a bandanna, tie a scarf around your eyes, use a hat, and so forth. Otherwise, you may find yourself up at the crack of dawn, as it is hard to darken a car completely. No sleeping bag? Two blankets pinned together with safety pins are the next best thing. Or even sleeping under a pile of blankets.; , A thin cloth (like a sheet or even a towel) hung in the windows keeps bugs out and lets air in. The weather is the most important thing to consider when in this situation. Hot weather can actually be worse than cold, as you could wake up in the morning feeling sticky, gross, and covered in mosquito bites. Try opening the windows just an inch or so to find a happy medium.   You can also buy mesh to place in your windows (or sunroof). Wire mesh can be scavenged from an old screen window or door, or screening can be bought at a hardware store. Be careful of very hot temperatures in cars. Cars can heat up very quickly, and if you are in a very hot climate, such as a desert, this can be a real hazard. If you become overcome with heat, you may not wake up and realize you are close to dangerous dehydration and/or heat exhaustion.  Try to think ahead, especially if you plan on spending more than one or two nights in your car. It will likely get dark out, and harder to find what you need before bedding down for the night. This likely means:   Water Flashlight Pillow (or pillow-like object), blanket or sleeping bag. Cell phone: for emergencies, for a wake-up alarm, or a game to play. Book: A little reading can make a dull night more pleasant. Coffee can with lid (for men and women with excellent aim) in case you have to pee, it may be easier to do so with a coffee can than get up in the cold or bug-filled outdoors. Hand sanitizer or baby wipes. Clean your hands before eating or after using the bathroom or any time hygiene is in doubt. Since you may have irregular access to running water, these toiletries can help prevent you from illness and keep you looking and smelling presentable. If you are in the car with others or with cargo, you will likely be sleeping sitting up. Sleeping in the car seat is not exactly the best place to sleep, but if you have to, use a travel pillow that supports your head and neck. You will wake up in the morning much happier.  A tidy car makes it easier to find things, especially at night. A clean car is a pleasure to sleep in and even a few inches often makes a great difference in your comfort. Also, if it is dirty and smelly, it will be much more difficult to fall asleep.   Keep only the essentials out, like a flashlight, water, a backpack for one set of clothes (unless you are traveling), and a towel. A cleaner car also attracts less attention, especially if clean on the outside. Few people will think to ask questions of a car that looks presentable. A filthy car filled with trash and bags looks suspicious. Avoid clutter by putting things away during the day. While you do not absolutely have to roll up your sleeping bag in the back seat or fold your towel, it will look tidier from the outside and thus less suspicious. This is especially important if you are trying to not be obvious about sleeping in your car.  Tarps are inexpensive, usually easy to find, and will keep prying eyes away. A tarp can help cut down on sunlight while often also allow for ample ventilation.   Tarps on cars can look suspicious. Most people do not cover a car with a tarp, so this can point out a person sleeping in a car. In some places, this can be a problem, as described below.  Unfortunately, sleeping in your car is illegal in many places, and even if not technically illegal will often be judged suspicious by the locals. Here are a few ideas:   Stores like Walmart, movie theaters or 24 hour gyms. It is hard to tell who is sleeping in their cars and who is just parked while shopping, watching a film or working out. The downside is that people will also be constantly in the area-- although this can be a form of security as well.. Also, many of these 24 hour stores also have bright lights on all night long. Churches and other sanctuary-like establishments. Very often these buildings are quiet most of the week. If someone finds you, hopefully they will be kind enough to just continue on their merry way. Backroads and under overpasses. These are low-volume areas where you may not be disturbed, but just make sure the area is actually quiet and remote. An apparently nearly deserted back road may actually be well-travelled by residents, who know who is supposed to be there and who is not. Also, rural roads may have trucks or farm equipment constantly moving through. Residential areas that allow street parking. In this situation, your car will often just blend in on the side of the road. Just do not stay for too long or your vehicle may appear suspicious. Keep in mind that some urban residential areas may require special parking stickers to park legally. Also, street lights may become a problem for good sleeping. Public overnight parking. If it is an overhead parking garage, park on a high floor so that noise from cars entering and exiting will not bother you. Make sure to check signs to make sure the time limit is long enough and the parking lot allows overnight parking.  Many locations may be quiet and relatively safe one day, and not another.   Example: An empty parking lot next to a soccer field. During the middle of Friday night, no one is around, there are portable toilets, and it is seemingly perfect, but the next morning, there are a ton of screaming 7-year-olds ready for Little League and their mothers and fathers are peering suspiciously in the direction of your car. Example: A quiet corner, not a person in sight, and it's dark enough to sleep. But when you awake the next morning you find that there are shady-looking individuals about who also like the isolation of the area.  Consider two things:   Face your car in the direction where it would be most difficult for people to spy on you or look in the windows to see you there. Corners are good, too. Face your car in the direction you want for the morning. Face it east if you want to wake with the sun and west if you want to stay snoozing.  This is just good sense as you are likely going to have to use the bathroom at some point. If you can get easy access to a bathroom, you will have a better experience and keep more hygienic.   Be careful of safety, however. Bathrooms that are unattended are also sometimes locations for crime. A bathroom that is in a 24 hour store or interstate rest stop is likely safer than a public bathroom in an urban park - but not always. Portable toilets are sometimes available at all hours. These are sometimes found at rest stops, construction sites, or parks. You can sometimes get away with using facilities (such as the pool or beachside bathroom and shower) of a campground, hotel, or the like if security is a bit lax, and you are sneaky. Gas stations usually offer public bathrooms. You can always urinate outside if you must, but this can result in a public urination citation in populated areas.  Showers and bathing may be tricky to find on the road, but not impossible.   In many areas, public beaches have showers. Some truck stops have pay showers. While not free, they can be a great comfort on the road. A "solar shower" is easy to find in most camping equipment stores. It is a bag that heats up water during the day, that can be used to shower or wash dishes at night. While such a device still needs a way to hoist the bag up high, and get some privacy, it can give a good shower when there is no running water.  If you're worried you will be found, consider making it so your car can not really be seen. You can either do this with a tarp, by putting a whole bunch of goods in your car blocking you from view, or by sleeping underneath a pile of linens.  Park your car in your spot for the night, and make a visit to the bathroom beforehand.  Again, this depends on the climate you are in. However, it is going to get stuffy regardless of the temperature (within reason, of course), so consider cracking the window slightly. If you are under a pile of blankets in the cold, it might actually feel good.   Do not crack it too much, though, for security purposes. And if there are mosquitoes, crack it even less. A half an inch or less (1.25 cm) is plenty.  If you have problems sleeping in less than perfect conditions or your body has a tendency to "wake up" achy, pop one before hitting the sack. It will be easier to fall asleep, easier to stay asleep, and you will feel less sore in the morning.  As much as possible, that is. If you are in the back seat, move the front seats forward to get the most space possible. Tuck in the seat belt clips so they do not end up jabbing you in the back.   If the back seats turn down, do so. You could also pop open the back so you can put your legs (or head) in the trunk area.  On the off chance someone comes knocking on your door, you want to be wearing clothes, and acceptable clothes at that. So get comfortable, but stay dressed. Workout clothes are best. This way you can also turn your bed into a getaway car at a moment's notice if need be.   And account for the weather, too. If it is cold, make sure your head is covered to keep heat from escaping. If necessary, put on several layers. If it is hot, a t-shirt and shorts will do just fine. You could also wet them beforehand to stay cool.  The community your car is parked in may react to your presence, and how you look and act may well determine how you are treated. If you are considered suspicious, you may find yourself harassed or even jailed if you are not careful.  People tend to be less concerned about strangers when they are friendly. Say hello to people, be polite, and a little confident chit-chat can go a long way to reassuring the locals.   In general, keep to yourself. Drawing too much attention to yourself is usually not a great idea. Car camping is often technically illegal, so you do not need to spotlight yourself. If you have a particularly charismatic and outgoing personality, you may find yourself able to use your abilities to your advantage. You can find out information, ask favors, maybe even find a friend. But, of course, be careful as not every friendly stranger is safe.  If you are dirty, scruffy, and dressed like a stereotypical "bum", this may draw the attention of the locals. Try to keep clean, dress in an unassuming manner, and look as though you are a respectable individual.  If confronted by authorities, such as a police officer, store manager, park ranger, or concerned citizen, it is good to have a simple story about why you are there that is believable and not scary. It could well be true, or it may not be, depending on your situation. For example:   "My deepest apologies, I'm on my way to a rally in Washington, D.C. I feel very strongly about protecting the environment, you see. I don't have money for a hotel, so I was planning to sleep here for the night. I'm sorry if I worried you. I'll move right along." "I'm very sorry, I just lost my home and have nowhere to sleep until I get to my parents' home." "Sorry, sir. I pulled off of the road because I was falling asleep at the wheel. I've been driving for 10 hours. I'm OK, just wanted to be safe." "I'm sorry, officer - I'm getting away from an abusive relationship. I'm on my way to my sister's house in Alberta. I don't have any money for a hotel but I just had to get away from there as soon as I could." Be nice and polite to the police. Law enforcement officers may be there to enforce vagrancy laws, but they also really want to help people in need, too. Very often, they will offer help, leave you in peace, or at least let you be on your way without further trouble. Do not treat every police officer as you enemy; they are often helpful.  But do not depend on the local constable to be on your side, as not everyone will be. It is better to not get the attention of the police in the first place.    

for cold temperatures, buy a sleeping bag (or two).  for hot temperatures, let in the air and keep out insects.  gather supplies for a comfortable night.  keep your car clean.  consider getting a tarp.  find somewhere that you will not get ticketed.  take into account what your spot will look like during the day as well as at nighttime, and weekday versus weekend.  face your car in the right direction.  pick somewhere with bathrooms (or equivalent) if possible.  take a bath once in a while.  consider camouflaging yourself.  make sure to visit the bathroom before you turn in.  consider cracking the windows.  take an anti-inflammatory, such as ibuprofen.  adjust the seats.  get into the appropriate amount of layers but stay in comfortable clothes.  keep in mind that your behavior and appearance will help determine how others will react to you.  be friendly.  look respectable.  have a good story - even if it may not be true.

 If you have cannabis that you want to use in cooking, decarboxylation is a vital part of the process. Start by breaking up the cannabis into small pieces. Then put the cannabis onto a baking tray, and spread it across the tray as you would whatever you were cooking., To decarboxylate cannabis, you need to heat it to around 240 degrees Fahrenheit. This is the temperature at which decarboxylation occurs.Heat your oven to this temperature, before placing your baking tray of cannabis into it.  When the oven is up to temperature, place your tray of cannabis in there. To achieve the maximum amount of decarboxylation, you need to heat it until the bubbling dissipates.There is no fixed amount of time you should leave it in there for, but around an hour is generally considered to produce the best results.   Keep an eye on it, and give it a quick stir every ten minutes or so. Cannabis with a higher moisture content may take longer than an hour, but you should never raise the temperature above 240 degrees Fahrenheit., After around an hour, you should remove the cannabis from the oven and allow it cool. You will notice that the colour will have changed, and become a medium brown. You will also notice it has dried and it should have quite a crumbly texture.   Once it has cooled you can grind it in a food processor so that is in made into a small enough powder to use easily in cooking. Store it in an airtight container like your other herbs and use as appropriate., The marijuana flower contains THCA, which in its natural state, is not psychoactive. The psychoactive THC is only created through the process known as decarboxylation. By heating the THCa, that THC is activated and can then be absorbed when consumed., The main reason to decarboxylate cannabis is to achieve the maximum potency and efficiency for oral consumption, rather than for medicinal purposes.A separate process of decarboxylation is not necessary when cannabis is smoked or vaporized, because the heating involved releases the THC without needing any prior decarboxylation., Decarboxylation can greatly increase the potency of cannabis. If you are cooking something and are going to include decarboxylated cannabis, be sure to act sensibly and recognise just how potent it might be. It can easier to consume a larger amount of cannabis in food than by smoking.  

prepare the cannabis.  heat the oven.  put the cannabis in the oven.  allow it to cool.  know what decarboxylation is.  recognise why to do it.  act responsibly. 

 You don't always have to use your words to express appreciation. Sometimes, doing something nice for your parents is enough. Your parents value you, and want to spend time with you. Plan a fun day full of family activities.Take your parents to see a movie they would like. Plan a family picnic. Treat a parent to lunch. Go to a local attraction, like a museum, with your parents and any siblings.  The gift of time is often all your parents need to know you appreciate them. Do not wait until something has occurred to show appreciation. Do so regularly by spending time with your parents. Try to find a little time each week to visit your parents.If you don't live near home, try to find time to call each week. A quick phone call can really show your parents you care.  If you're feeling grateful, try finding a present your parents would like. Presents don't have to only be given on holidays or special occasions. If you see something your mom would love at a local gift shop, don't hesitate to buy it. A surprise gift can really show that you care., Anything your parents dread doing (chore wise) make sure and do! This will take many sacrifices. If you live at home, you can show appreciation by chipping in regarding household chores. In addition to doing any chores expected of you, do a little extra now and then. For example, do the dishes when your mom has had a busy day at work. Take the trash out when you see your dad has forgotten to do so., Do it secretly, so they won't try to chime in and help you. Breakfast in bed will probably be the easiest meal. Don't wake them up though! 

treat your parents to a fun day.  spend time with your parents regularly.  give your parents a present.  help out around the house without being asked.  cook them their favorite meal.

Delivering on what you set out to do not only gives what you say credibility, but it also helps you gain respect from everyone.  

improve your communication skills by taking classes or seminars.  find online resources to help you with your communication skills.  inquire if your company offers any incentive to attend continuing education training, allows you to use company time to attend seminars or helps foot the bill of any training.  ,  strategize with the management team above you to discuss your role in the company and how you can best be utilized in that role.  ,  maintain a clear understanding of what is expected of you to help you better communicate with others.  ,  set clear goals for yourself.  work hard for yourself, the company and for your office teammates.  give respect if you would like to be respected.  walk the walk if you talk the talk. 

 Making the applesauce will allow you to control the amount of sugar and preservatives, resulting in even healthier baking.          To make your applesauce, wash, core and quarter 2 lb. (908 g) of apples. Put them in a large pot filled with water that is at least an inch (2.5 cm) deeper than the apples. Boil until the apples are soft. With a bit of cooking water or unsweetened apple juice, put them through a blender or food mill. Add 1 tsp. (2 g) of spices like nutmeg and cinnamon. For baking purposes, use unsweetened applesauce. Add up to 1/2 cup (96 g) of sugar or 1/3 cup (113 g) of honey to homemade applesauce, if you plan to eat it on its own. Reduce the amount of sugar you use in a recipe if you are using sweetened applesauce.; , Applesauce should be substituted for these ingredients, but not softened butter. The substitution works best for cakes, muffins and quick breads.          Substituting applesauce for oil or butter in cookies is not recommended. It can result in mushy cookies that do not hold their shape.  For example, 1/2 cup (118 ml) of oil is equal to 1/2 cup (56.5 g) of applesauce.  For example, if a recipe calls for 1/2 cup (118 ml) of oil, substitute 1/4 cup (28.3 g) of applesauce and also add 1/4 cup (59 ml) of oil. Taste the result and move toward replacing more oil with applesauce next time if it compliments the recipe.          You do not need to substitute all of the oil to get a healthy effect. If your recipe turns out better with a little oil and a little applesauce, you can consider it a healthy substitution.  This will provide a more accurate measurement than using a dry measuring cup.  This will ensure the applesauce is well mixed. The recipe will also turn out to be more moist, if the dry ingredients are mixed with the wet ingredients right before baking.  Low-fat recipes should not be over-baked as they can be extra dry.         

make your own applesauce, if possible.  review your recipe to see if it calls for oil or melted butter.  substitute using a 1 to 1 ratio.  start substituting applesauce for a portion of the fat to get familiar with the effect of the oil.  measure applesauce the same way as oil, in a liquid measuring cup.  incorporate the applesauce into the wet ingredients with a mixer before combining the dry ingredients.  refrain from changing the cooking time on the recipe. 

 This includes copying schoolwork and homework. Be yourself instead of someone you're not.; , Don't be the girl that copies everyone else. A lot of kids will do dangerous and wrong things to be popular. Don't follow their example―there is another way to be popular. Be kind! Help others! Be the one that always does their homework and gets good grades. Soon, others will be following your path.  If the teacher has math tutoring, that can also help you.  For example, if you have a timer, set it for 15-20 minutes. If you got every answer within 15-20 minutes, reward yourself. This will encourage you to do your homework as soon as you get home. Take a quick break from homework every 30 minutes.  Don't let anyone push you around. You should be happy, have a positive spirit, and not judge others. Here's a good idea: every time you get mad, count to 10 in your head and breathe slowly.  If you wear a strapless shirt (even one with straps), the staff will still tell you to put a jacket on. So, if you know that you shouldn't wear it, don't.  Pick the right friends that actually care about you and don't do anything mean toward you. The right friends should trust you, treat you nicely, and be by your side.  Don't be upset because they seem to be mean in comparison to your old teacher.  Whenever you're absent, make sure that you ask your friend about which work pages should be solved at home. By doing this, you can avoid being inside school all day when other people are happily at recess.  4th grade has a lot of drama, as this is where you start to grow up, so don't be surprised about any of it. Watch yourself and avoid making dramatic mistakes.  You are starting to grow up now and you do not want to be that girl who forgot to put on deodorant. 

don't be a copycat.  be a good role model.  try to get extra credit or try to do redoes that the teacher offers.  have a routine that will help you complete your homework faster.  avoid being a bully.  dress appropriately in school.  choose your friends wisely.  don't worry about "mean" teachers.  stay on top of things when you're absent.  avoid drama.  have good hygiene. 

 The first step to sharing the road with a cyclist is to know that they're there. When you are backing up, look for someone of a bike. When passing another car, look for a bicycle. They have a right to be on the road, so look for them.; , If a cyclist is on the sidewalk, be careful. Before you pull out of an ally, driveway, or parking lot; yield to a cyclist on the sidewalk.  Kids really are unpredictable. Especially kids who are learning to ride a bike. They may swerve out into traffic, try to pop a wheelie, fall, or a number of other unexpected things. Drive slowly, and be prepared to stop!  , Why would a cyclist be in the middle of the lane? Aren't they supposed to stay to the side? Yes, but there may be hazards on their part of the road. Broken glass, construction barricades, parked cars, pile of dirt or leaves; all these things that motorists don't have to worry about, will make cyclists get into the middle of the lane. Don't follow them too closely, and watch for hazards on the side of the road. If a cyclists needs to get into the lane to avoid these dangers, or make a left-hand turn, let them do so.  When passing a bike, you have to keep at least three feet in between your car and the cyclist. When moving at high speeds, slow down and give them more room when you pass. The wind draft off of your vehicle can suck them towards you. One more situation where a bike needs more room would be going up a hill. Cyclists have to pump harder to get up a hill, and this usually means the bike rocks back-and-forth a little. Give them more than three feet.  Don't cut in front of bikes. Sometimes, when cars want to make a right turn, they speed up to get in front of the bike, only to hit the brakes when they turn. Be patient. Slow down, wait for the bike to pass, and then make the turn.  When a car stops at a four-way stop, they usually look for other cars. However, cyclists have just as much right to use the road as a car. If the bike came to the intersection first, it gets to go first. If it's on the right, and both the car and the bike arrived at the same time, the cyclist has the right of way.  Again, patience is key. Bikes are smaller and thus are harder to spot. Before you make a left-hand turn, scan the area closely for cars and bikes. Also, because they are smaller they look farther away, and most motorists think cyclists move fairly slowly. (However, bikes can easily be traveling at 25–30 mph (40–48 km/h).) So be patient, and be careful when judging the distance and speed of oncoming bikes.  Because bikes are smaller, they are harder to see than a car. Blind spots can completely hide a bike. Make sure you check over your shoulder for bikes in particular, before turning, passing, or merging.  Would you believe that some of the worst car-bike incidents are conflicts between cyclists and car doors? It's true. Many cyclists are injured each year by either having a car door hit their bike from the side, from behind, or by running into it as it's opened. Look for cyclists before you open the door.  

look for bike traffic.  yield to cyclists on sidewalks.  use caution around kids on sidewalks.  respect cyclists in the middle of the lane.  pass safely.  execute safe right hand turns.  be careful at stop signs.  be safe when performing left hand turns.  watch for bikes in your blind spots.  open car doors with caution. 

 Because aluminum is soft, choose a non-abrasive dish detergent such as Dawn. Spread a squirt of the detergent over the aluminum, enough to use to scrub out stains. During regular use, hammered aluminum can be cleaned like any metal dishware.Alternatives to dish detergent include an orange cleaner, lemon juice, or a degreaser such as Dawn Power Dissolver.; , Warm water will loosen up stains such as those from food left on dishware. You don’t need the water to be hot. Submerge the aluminum item in the water.  Again, the brush must be soft or else it will leave scratches. Choose a sponge, non-abrasive pad, a soft-bristled scrub brush, or old toothbrush. Scrub the surface of the aluminum and most stains will come off.Don’t use steel wool or else the aluminum will gain small scratches.  If the stains are still present or when using an alternative detergent such as orange cleaner, allow the aluminum item to sit in warm water. Leave it alone for about five minutes. The warm water should make it easier to scrub or wipe away the stains.Five minutes is often enough to clear off debris while minimizing water exposure, but for stubborn stains you can try soaking it for 30 minutes.  Place the aluminum item under warm, running water. Make sure all the cleaner is rinsed off the surface.  Use a soft cloth to remove all the moisture. Make sure all the water is gone so none of it sits on the metal and causes stains. 

use a gentle detergent on the aluminum.  fill the sink with warm water.  scrub the stains with a non-abrasive brush.  soak still-stained pieces for a few minutes.  rinse off the soap.  dry the aluminum off immediately. 

 Involve yourself with friends, family, neighbors, co-workers, or even strangers in need. Strengthen your ties with loved ones and acquaintances to form a network that you can rely upon instead of feeling isolated and overwhelmed. At the same time, boost your sense of self-worth with the satisfaction that comes from being a reliable source of support for others. Simple steps that you can take based on your availability include:Making a point of using polite phrases such as “please” and “thank you.” Asking people, “How are you?” as an actual question instead of a greeting. Simple acts like holding doors and helping to carry heavy loads. Regularly calling and planning visits or activities with friends and loved ones. Offering your assistance with other people’s projects. Volunteering your services for organizations like churches, hospitals, nursing homes, non-profits, and schools.  Set aside time each day for some form of physical activity. Bolster your self-esteem by improving your physical health. Set simple, achievable goals for yourself (such as being able to run nonstop for 20 minutes in six weeks from now) to prove that you can overcome challenges: a skillset that you can then transfer to dealing with stress and anxiety. As an added benefit, some studies suggest that exercising can actually boost the bodily chemicals that make us feel more positive. Try one or more of the following:A daily routine of light exercises around the house, such as jumping jacks, push-ups, sit-ups, lunges, and pull-ups. Getting out of the house to run, hike, bike, or swim and enjoy some alone-time. Joining a gym, team sport, or running/biking/swimming club to connect with other people.  Stick to a regular meal-schedule as best you can so that your stress or anxiety isn't made worse by hunger or low energy. Abstain from unrefined sugars and high glycemic carbs, which can affect your body chemistry by causing spikes and crashes in energy. Drink plenty of water, since dehydration can make the situation worse.Foods proven to combat stress and anxiety include: acai berries, asparagus, avocados, blueberries, chia seeds, dark chocolate, nuts, oranges, salmon, seaweed, spinach, sunflower seeds, whole grains, and yogurt. Low to moderate caffeine habits may prove beneficial to those with mild to moderate stress and anxiety. However, those with higher levels should avoid it, since it may trigger or worsen attacks. Avoid alcohol, nicotine, and other drugs.  Maintain good sleep habits. Aim for seven to nine hours of straight sleep each day with a fixed bedtime. Avoid taking naps, which may make your seven-to-nine hours harder to achieve. Also avoid using your bed and bedroom for any activities other than sleeping. Condition your body to expect sleep when you get into bed. Things to avoid include:Taking stimulants such as caffeine and nicotine in the evening. Watching TV or staring at a computer screen immediately before bedtime. Exercising, working, or doing chores right before bed. Keeping the lights and/or radio on.  

participate in your community.  exercise.  maintain a healthy diet.  get plenty of sleep.

 If you are cooking a recipe that calls for spinach or chard, you can use sorrel as a replacement. Consider the bitterness of sorrel and decide how it will alter the dish you are planning on making., The bitter and unique taste of sorrel can be appreciated as a garnish for many different dishes like mashed potatoes, rice, lentils, eggs, and cheese. Try replacing a garnish like parsley with sorrel and see if you enjoy the taste., The bitter taste of sorrel tastes great in different kinds of salads. Be careful not to add too many leaves, or it could overpower the taste of your salad and make it too bitter. Use traditional greens like iceberg lettuce, spinach, and romaine lettuce to build the base of your salad and then add some sorrel leaves to it to enhance the flavor. 

replace spinach, chard, or arugula with sorrel.  accent dishes with a sprig of sorrel.  add sorrel to your salad. 

 The drain-waste-overflow pipe assembly must be positioned correctly. Place the rubber gasket on top of the waste overflow, which is the top opening of the pipe. Align the drain tailpiece at the bottom of the pipe with the tub drain hole.  Place a thick layer that covers the bottom of the flange. Clean any putty off the bathtub immediately to avoid having it dry and stick to the tub surface., Adjust it within the hole, and screw the drain flange into the drain tailpiece opening. Make sure it is secure, but not overly tight in case it needs to be adjusted later., These components can be found at any hardware or home improvement store. Choose something that will fit tastefully with the decorative theme of the bathroom., Do not attach the stopper to the tub. Leave all the connections loose so that they can be tightened and adjusted during the installation process., The hardware should come with screws. Fasten the trip lever assembly to the tub overflow cover plate., Tighten and secure the stopper., Use a screwdriver to make sure there are no loose pieces, or gaps and holes between the hardware and the tub. Turn on the water and test the bathtub drain. Make sure the water pools when the drain lever is flipped up, and drains when the lever is flipped down. 

assemble the overflow pipe.  apply plumber's putty around the bottom part of the drain flange.  place the drain flange in the hole of the tub, on the bottom.  purchase the trip lever and drain hardware.  assemble the trip lever and the pop-up drain stopper according to the package instructions.  feed the trip lever assembly through the overflow hole in the back of the tub.  attach the pop-up stopper to the link at the bottom of the trip lever hardware.  tighten all screws and pieces once everything is in place. 

 If you have air conditioning, keeping your cat indoors will ensure that he stays cool too. Many of the things you do to keep the house cool for yourself will also benefit your cat, such as keeping the blinds, drapes, and doors closed.Make sure that your cat can go into a warmer room if she feels too cold. (Sometimes air-conditioning and fans can make things too cold and this may be irritating for a cat, after a while.) Even if your cat likes to spend time outside, it is recommended to keep your cat inside during the hottest part of summer days, which is between 10am and 4pm.; , If you do not have air condition, fans and open windows are another good option to cool off your home and your cat. Place fans in front of open windows to move air through your home and cool it down. Make sure the fans you use are safe for your pet to be around by checking to see if the cover for the rotating blades is secure.   Place one fan or more at floor level in a corner of the room facing towards the center of the room. This way the cat can lay at a distance that is comfortable for her to get some air movement over her fur. This air movement helps to cool down your cat in a way that is similar to sweating., Cats need access to water in order to stay hydrated. In addition, when your cat’s blood temperature rises, sensors in the brain tell her to drink water in order to cool down and dilute the blood. Therefore, it is essential to make sure that your cat always has access to clean, fresh water.Provide multiple drinking bowls with a large surface area (such as dinner plates or dog bowls). Wider bowls encourage the cat to drink because cat do not like their whiskers to touch the sides of the bowl. Make sure that you replace the water at least once a day and keep it topped up at all times. Never let your cat drink from water than contains algae as the latter is toxic and may cause diarrhea, vomiting, seizures, and sudden death.Consider getting a cat drinking fountain. Many cats prefer to drink running water and a cat drinking fountain is a great way to do this.  Cats are smart about comfort at all times, including during the heat. Cats love to curl up in the bathtub or sink because porcelain stays cool even when it is hot outside. Because they are often cooler, cats sometimes prefer tiled areas of the house, such as the bathroom, laundry room, and kitchen. If your cat chooses a spot and seems comfortable, let her be. 

run the air conditioning.  use fans to improve the air flow in your home.  provide fresh drinking water at all times.  let your cat choose a cool spot. 

 Even in high school, you can take certain classes that will prepare you for plumbing. A number of high schools offer vocational training for upperclassmen. Ideal courses would be in plumbing and heating. You can still prepare yourself by enrolling in classes in math, physics, and computer technology.You may also want to take classes in drafting and blueprint reading, if your school offers them.; , You’re required to complete high school or get your GED to enroll in vocational training and apprenticeships. People working in your school’s career center may have connections and available programs for you.   Take advantage of the resources available to you.  Survey the available community colleges in your area. Depending on the school, you may be able to attend any state community college. Pick a school that has a program that specializes in plumbing. Some schools offer one year vocational degrees while others offer a two associate's degree.If you’re unsure about the options available, talk to your high school’s counseling services. Certain high schools have resources for advising and contacting colleges.  Once you find a plumbing program at a trade school, technical or community college, you’ll need to sign up for classes. You'll earn a certificate that covers water supply and drainage systems, as well as piping equipment. It is not necessary to get a degree in plumbing, but many companies and state agencies prefer it.   Not all plumbers get their vocational training in this manner.  Depending on the school you decide on, you might be able to take courses that specialize in niche areas of study. There is a major shift towards water conservation today and many businesses want plumbers who specialize in this.  

take relevant classes.  get your high school diploma or ged.  research higher education.  enroll in vocational training.  take specialty programs. 

 Tension gathers in our muscles. When you feel tense and stressed, try loosening those tense muscles to help you relax.   Give yourself a hand massage. Hands carry a lot of tension, especially if you work on a computer. Apply some relaxing lotion onto your hands, like peppermint or lavender. Then massage the muscle right under your thumb.Loosen your jaw muscle. Open your mouth wide as you breathe. Hold it for 30 seconds, then release.Try acupressure. Acupressure is an Asian body technique where you massage and apply pressure to certain points on your body to release tension.  Familiar motions have a calming effect. Routines help put your body at ease. Repetitive motions are great for people who cannot seem to relax by being still. You can do something familiar and repetitive while clearing your mind of troubling thoughts.Try brushing your hair, knitting, or washing dishes. Gardening is another great repetitive motion.  Fill the tub with hot water. Allow yourself to soak in the warm water instead of rushing to clean yourself. Let your muscles relax and restore in the water.Try adding essential oils, like lavender oil. Bath salts, bubble bath, and scented bath petals can also be relaxing. Light candles and play soft music. Allow your mind to clear and focus on the scents, the water, and the music. If you have access to one, sit in a hot tub. Steam rooms and saunas can also be relaxing.  Exercise can help boost your mood and help you relax. This doesn't mean you have to run. Any kind of physical activity, including light movement, can get your blood pumping, raise your endorphins, and make you more relaxed.Go for a 15 minute walk around the block. Try doing light yoga poses. Stretch your body, especially your neck and shoulders. Try head and shoulder rolls.  Don't spend the hour before bed watching television or surfing the internet. These activities can keep your mind engaged and keep you from relaxing. Drinking alcohol before bed can also result in restless sleep.Instead, spend the 30 minutes before bed bringing yourself down from the day.   Read before bed. Take a warm bath. Spend a few minutes journaling. Meditate or work on your breathing techniques. Decide what is the best way for you to come down from the day so you can full relax and sleep soundly.  

relax your muscles.  go through repetitive motions.  take a bath.  get moving.  prep your body for sleep. 

 Open the box and unwrap all the pieces. This includes removing any sticky tape from the handle, floor piece, cleaning solution and cleaning pads. Set all these items to the side for easy access.; , After lining up all 3 of the main pieces, snap the pole with the mop, the middle pole, and the pole with the handle together.   If your Swiffer is pre-assembled, you may need to pull the handle to extend the pole. Listen for a click. Once the pole is extended, it is permanently extended.  Your Swiffer will generally require 4 AA batteries. To remove the battery panel, click the notch inside the area that holds the cleaning supply. Open the cover and insert the batteries., Your Swiffer should come with liquid cleaning supply. To insert the liquid, turn the Swiffer upside down. The flat side of the cleaner should fit flush against the pole of the Swiffer. Once the cleaning bottle is aligned, firmly press it up into the Swiffer holder.You should hear a click once the liquid is inserted correctly.   Older models may need the lid of the cleaning solution to be turned slightly. In current models, there is a seal that will be broken by the Swiffer. If you suspect you have an older bottle, try turning the lid a quarter turn.  While looking at the cleaning pad you will see two strips of paper. These will need to be removed to allow the sticky adhesive to seal onto the Swiffer itself. Once removed, line the adhesive up with the bottom of your Swiffer. Put the Swiffer down onto the pad and hold for three seconds and the pad should automatically stick on.Swiffer pads have an extra-tough-spot cleaning strip that is textured. It can be found on one side of the mopping pad. When applying the pad to the Swiffer, put the tough-side at the back end of the mop. Swiffer pads come in many styles with different cleaning products. If you don’t like the initial choice, don’t be afraid to go back and exchange your Swiffer for a new style.  To use your Swiffer, lay it on the floor pointed at the mess you wish to clean. Gently press the button on the handle to release the cleaning liquid. Mop the Swiffer back and forth to clean the liquid.   A 2-3 second hold of the button will release enough liquid to clean approximately 10 square feet of flooring.  To access the batteries, you must remove the Swiffer cleaner. To do so, hold the Swiffer upside down. Push the large button between the cleaner and the Swiffer pole. Pull down firmly to remove the cleaner., The battery tab will have a finger notch you can pull down. Put your finger within the opening and pull down. This will slide the battery cover off., Remove the batteries and replace them with new ones. Check to make sure you are putting them in the correct direction.Batteries should be recycled. Your local township should have a recycling depot that will recycle your one-use batteries free of charge.Save them in a container until you’re ready to dispose.  Once you’ve inserted the new batteries, replace the battery cover and the cleaning supplies. If you don’t need your swiffer right away, you can test it without putting on a pad by holding the button down.   If the Swiffer doesn’t release liquid, disassemble it and check that the batteries have been inserted correctly.  

unwrap the swiffer.  snap the 3 pieces of the pole together.  insert batteries.  insert cleaner.  put on a cleaning pad.  flip the swiffer rightside up and test.  remove the cleaner.  remove the battery tab.  replace the expired batteries.  reassemble the swiffer and test. 

 There’s no set way to format a resume, but the biggest rule is to format consistently.Use one font size for section headings and another for general text, and include consistent bold or italic emphases.For example, if you bold employers’ names in your experience section, write your college in bold, especially if it’s a prestigious school or one known for excellence in your field. Use a standard sans-serif font, like Arial, for easy readability. Use a 10-12 point size for general text and 14-16 point for section headings.   ; , Always include the name of your institution, its location, and the name of your degree. You can either write out your full degree name (like Bachelor of Arts) or use its acronym (like B.A.)  if you need to save room.Include honors you were awarded instead of your GPA, especially if you’re not a recent grad.If you’re a recent grad with a high GPA, you could opt to include your GPA. Just be sure to explain your GPA system by writing, for example, “3.92/4.0.” You can also include your graduation year if you’re a recent grad. Otherwise, you should avoid including dates, especially if your degree is older than 15 years.An example degree listing could be:Yale University, New Haven, CT. Bachelor of Arts in English, Magna cum laude.  Using “Education” to head the appropriate section is the only descriptive word you’ll need. Including words like “College:” or “Degree:” before the appropriate information is superfluous.Avoid unnecessary words elsewhere in your resume, too. For example, don’t write “Email:” or “Phone:” before listing your contact information. Just write your email address and phone number.  If you’ve just graduated, you might not have substantial professional experience. Place your education section at the top of your resume, just under your contact information and, if you’ve included one, your career objective. You can also include the year you received the degree if you’ve graduated in the last one to three years.If you’re not a recent grad or have substantial professional experience, place your relevant experience section ahead of your education. In general, professional experience is more valuable information than your education.  If you have more than one degree, list them in reverse chronological order, or the most recent degree first. In general, you should also list advanced degrees first.If you double majored, you can just list both degrees in the same section under your university:Yale University, New Haven, CT. Double major: Bachelor of Arts, English. Bachelor of Arts, Art History.  If you have completed work toward or have earned a college degree, you shouldn't include information about your high school. You can also skip it if you have significant work experience.If not, and if your high school diploma is your highest degree, include your high school's name and location, graduation date (if it's within the last three years), and, if it's above a 3.5/4.0, your GPA: Nashua High School, Nashua, New Hampshire High School Diploma, 2016. GPA: 3.8 If your highest degree is a GED diploma or state equivalent certificate, include it if you don't have substantial work experience: Education General Educational Development Diploma, 2016. Education CHSPE (Certificate of Proficiency from the State of California), 2016.  

format your resume consistently.  write the institution, its location, your degree, and any honors.  avoid including unnecessary or obvious words.  place the education section near the top if you’re a recent grad.  list your most recent degree first.  list your high school diploma if it's your highest degree. 

 Different soccer players have different training needs to be successful. A goalie, after all, doesn't need to be able to run for as long as a center midfielder. But even similar positions, like outside defenders and midfielders, can focus on slightly different training regimens:    Goalies: Need quick, powerful reactions and very little long-distance stamina. Focus on strength, reactions, and a slim, quick figure.  Defenders: Need upper/lower body strength and sprinting speed. Rarely required to jog or run for long, continuous times, they need to be able to get to every ball and win it in the air or on the ground.  Midfielders: Need to be able to run for days. They should have exceptional stamina and above-average speed. Quickness and strong foot skills are a must.  Forwards: Need a balance of speed and strength, like defenders, but must also be able to jog for days to confuse defenders and open up offensive space.; , The best way to get in soccer shape is to play soccer. While you will need to work on additional training as well, games force you to work on endurance, strength, speed, and agility in real-life situations. As long as you're exhausted at the end of the game, you've gotten a good training session in.   When playing games for fun, move around and play multiple positions. This will help you learn the game and build full-body fitness.  Interval training is when you alternate hard sprints or effort with short rest periods, teaching your body to get to top speed and recover your energy quickly. It is much more game-realistic than an hour of jogging, and is proven to get faster results.A sample workout might look like this (note that there is no "rest" period. Jogging is your rest).   Jog for 5-10 minutes to warm up. Sprint for 30 seconds. Jog for 1 minute (1:30 if struggling) Alternate sprinting/jogging for 9 more sprints. Jog for 5-10 minutes to cool down. Lower the rest period as you get better, eventually aiming for a 30-second sprint and jog.  Being quick on your feet is essential to becoming a killer player. There are endless exercises to try, but some classics include:    Cone Runs: Stagger the cones in a zig-zag, then run the course, focusing on sharp turns around each cone.  Suicides: Mark off to lines roughly 20 yards apart. Sprint to the end, touch the line, and sprint back. Focus on maintaining speed and balance as you change directions as quickly and smoothly as possible.  Ladder drills: Focus on light, fast feet. Make up different patterns to train agility -- both feet in each hole, down and back, sideways, etc.  Hurdles or Box Jumps: Focus on landing on your toes and springing back up quickly and efficiently. You want to land, compress, and shoot back up quickly, as if winning a header., A long, slow run is not a great way to train for soccer on its own, but it still has a place in your workout. Use it on off days to move and stretch your muscles when you can't fully work out. Swim and bike to activate different muscles and give your joints a rest from the pounding of constant running. No matter what your style, aim for a simple, easy pace and try to run for at least 30 minutes to an hour.  Full-body strength allows you to fight hard for loose balls, resist tackles, and muscle for position on crosses and clears. Soccer players want to stay lean, but still strong, and light strength training will make you a formidable opponent anywhere on the field. Work on the following muscle groups 2-4 times a week, choosing 2-3 exercises for each group.    Chest and Back: Your chest and back muscles will help you create and keep space in the box or in the air. A strong back, furthermore, increases balance on the ball and overall strength.  Tone your arms: Bicep curls, dips, tricep push-ups (your hands form a diamond under your chest), and pull-ups all build solid muscle from home. Toning your arms helps push away defenders and attackers and keep balance on the ball.Abs and Core: Sit-ups, crunches, and planks are an essential part of your workout, and can be performed daily. You transfer power between you upper and lower body through your core -- any crosses, shots, long passes, or headers require rock-solid muscles.  You will have to do dedicated fitness to truly train for soccer. That said, the fastest way to get to match fitness is to actually push yourself as if you were in a match. Whenever you do drills or play games, work until you're exhausted. It is far more fun than doing sprints later on to get strong, and far more game realistic.When you're tired, focus the most on your foot skills. The players that stay technically proficient even when they get tired are the ones that win last-minute games. Training in practice ensures you're training for your specific position. Even in pick-up games or scrimmages, the only way you get better is by working hard. Having a dedicated training partner can help ensure you always work hard, and a little bit of competition is great motivation.  

train for your position to get the most out of your fitness.  play games and scrimmages to train your whole body at once.  replace the majority of long distance runs with interval training for better results.  build agility and reaction speed with plyometric exercises and direction changing workouts.  use slow, long distance runs and endurance activities to recover and build endurance 1-2 a week.  build your upper body to fight defenders, win headers, and become a harder player to tackle.  push yourself as hard as you can in practices, scrimmages, and drills to get "match fitness." 

 The best enclosure to use is a glass aquarium. Size is a very important factor when deciding how many hermit crabs you will keep. A good rule of thumb is: one inch per gallon. to determine how many inches your crabs are, measure across the shell opening. Remember, the habitat (or as many people call "crabitat" or simply "the tat") needs to be able to hold three dishes, climbing toys, shelters, shells and space for the crabs to walk around. You don't want the tank to be crowded, but you don't want it to be too open, either.   A ten gallon tank usually does nicely for a maximum of six small hermit crabs. You may want to consider starting off with at least a twenty gallon tank. This will ensure all the necessary space needed is fulfilled. A larger tank will allow more climbing toys and more space. You will eventually need to upgrade the tank if you start off with a ten gallon. On the other hand, hermit crabs do not grow quickly. You can use a tank that leaks, as it will not be holding any water.; , Hermit crabs are escape artists. If there is any possible way for the crabs to escape, they will almost always find it. Use a glass lid or screen lid with glass rested on the screen if using heat lights. This will ensure no crabs escape and that all the humidity stays in the tank.   Select a lid with air holes installed on the lid.  Substrate, or bedding is probably one of the least provided needs a hermit crab can get. Hermit crabs require deep substrate that has to completely cover twice the height of your largest crab, preferably a few inches deeper. Medium crabs (golf ball size) need at least six inches of substrate for molting. Small crabs (quarter size) need 5 inches (12.7 cm), and tiny crabs (often called "micros", the size of a dime) need 4 inches (10.2 cm) of substrate. These substrate amounts are traditional molting depths.   Sand is usually the best choice, however, you can also used compressed coconut fiber commonly referred to an sold as "Eco Earth", "Bed-A-Beast" or "Forest Bedding". You can also use a mixture of the two. The sand or coco fiber needs to be kept at a good moisture level. It shouldn't be dry, but it shouldn't be dripping wet. Keep the substrate at sandcastle consistency. You should be able to make a hole in it easily, but not get your fingers wet. Substrate with these characteristics will allow your crab to grow (by molting, or shedding its exoskeleton) successfully. Do not use wood chips, gravel or newspaper etc.  Place dishes, toys, and shelters into the tank. Make sure that your shelter has a large enough opening for the crab to easily enter and exit. It's a good idea to place more than one shelter in the tank in case one crab would like to be alone. You can use coconut huts, ceramic flower pots, large shells, reptile caves, fish decor and many other things as shelters, as an option. Hermit crabs like to be hidden during the day so they will spend a great deal of time in these shelters.   Hermit crabs also love to climb! Provide climbing toys to keep the crabs and you entertained. You can use cholla wood, grapevine, fig wood, driftwood, mopani wood, bog wood, Lego structures, cork bark, fake or live plants, rocks, water stone, large coral, barnacle clusters, fish décor and much more. Providing this step is very easy and your crabs will love you for it! When landscaping your dishes, keep one thing in mind: Leave the water dishes away from the heat source. If water is placed near the heating unit bacteria will grow and that is not good. Keep the water on the cool side of the tank. Make sure that the dishes are deep enough to submerge the crab 3/4 of its body size. The dish should be large enough so that the crabs can walk around in the dish so they can fill their shells with water. If housing small and larger crabs crabs, place rocks, sea shells, small pieces of aquatic wood, or fake plants to allow the small crabs to easily exit the dish. Although they are social creatures, they sometimes like to be true hermits.  Hermit crabs need two types of water. Fresh and saltwater. Hermit crabs also cannot drink tap water. This water is treated with chlorine which can cause permanent blisters on the crabs gills (yes they have gills) which will be very painful for the hermit crabs. For this reason all water (including drinking and misting water) must be unchlorinated.   Buy a small bottle of tap water conditioner in the fish section of your pet store. Follow the instructions for making a gallon of water. It's a lot easier to have a batch of water ready to use for the next few weeks or so rather than having to make a small amount every day. When choosing a conditioner, do not purchase "Stress Coat" as this is used strictly for bathing your crabs and keeping fish only. Look for a conditioner that removes chlorine and chloramine and neutralizes heavy metals. Do not get a conditioner that stimulates a slime coat, other than for baths. After that, you have a batch of freshwater. Now simply make another batch of water and add some aquarium salt into the mix. Usually about 8-10 tablespoons of salt is enough. You may hear that only exotic species of hermit crabs need salt water, but this isn't true. All hermit crabs including the purple pincer (Coenobita clypeatus) need this. Many crabs drink saline water for hours prior to molting. And their shell water supply has a specific balance of iron. Providing salt water allows the hermit crab to choose what kind of water it would like to drink. Let the water sit overnight, so it comes to room temperature and the salt dissolves.  Place the hermit crab food in the dish. Hermit crabs are omnivorous scavengers that take advantage of any available food both in the wild and captivity. Feed your hermit crab basically anything you would eat yourself that isn't sugary, spicy, salty or preservative packed. They love grapes and blueberries, as well as most unsalted nuts. Apples are also a favorite. They enjoy many vegetables, and seafood is an absolute must in their diet. The best way to ensure they get proper nutrients is to feed a varied diet as possible.   Feed meats when given the opportunity, and you can also feed them plain cereals, rice, pasta and rolled oats. Many hermies love T-Rex brand Fruit and Flower Food. The fun thing about feeding these critters is that you can record and experiment with what they like and what they don't like. Hermit crabs eat very little and in small amounts. To put it in perspective, most hermit crabs take a few hours to eat half a cheerio. So don't think that your hermit crabs are starving, because they aren't! Make sure to remove foods after 24 hours to prevent rapid fouling of the tank.  Hermit crabs are tropical creatures that come from places like the Caribbean and the Florida Keys. They require temperatures between 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius) and 84 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius). Your home is most likely not warm enough to provide the heat these creatures need without an external heat source.   When using a ten gallon tank, the best way to heat the tank is with an under the tank heater (usually referred to as a UTH). These are small pads that stick to the outside glass of the enclosure and usually raise the temperature up between 4 and 6 degrees, which is perfect. Try placing the unit on the bottom of the tank. Even with the thick layer of substrate the UTH will be effective. Placing it on the side of the tank simply heats the air around the tank, and not the air in it. You can also use heat lights, which work great on larger enclosures and can usually heat the tank to any wanted temperature. Heat lights have one major drawback: They dry out the tank very quickly. When using lights be sure to select the right wattage of light, a 40 watt will do nicely on a 10 gallon (37.9 L) tank. Make sure that the heat source is placed on one side of the tank, and not in the middle. This is so the tank has a warm and cool side so they can be around whatever temperature they want as needed. Whatever heat source you use, be sure to purchase a thermometer/hydrometer to determine the ambient air temperature in the tank.  Hermit crabs do not grow their own shell. They take them from dead gastropods like snails. In captivity, you need to ensure that there is a wide variety of shells to choose from. You can tell if a hermit crab's shell fits if it can seal the opening of the shell with its large claw and armor leg (back left).   If its legs stick out a bit and you can still see its eyes, the hermit crab will be on the market for a new shell. Simply drop the shells in the tank and the hermit crab will change when ready. Purple pincers like shells with a round opening, while Ecuadorian hermit crabs like shells with a wider opening. You can dip the shells in salt water periodically to draw the crabs attention to them if you wish.  Take a small misting bottle and spray the substrate and the walls of the tank with conditioned water. Turn on the heat source and wait at least forty five minutes. The moist parts of the tank will evaporate with the heat source on, raising the humidity. Hermit crabs breathe through hardened gills that only function properly if the air is moist. Hermit crabs seem to enjoy a humidity range of 77% - 88%, but absolutely under no circumstances should it be below 70%.   With the sand moist and dishes full, the humidity should stay at a tolerable range. If not, you can lightly mist the tank some more. Once the temperature and humidity reach a desirable range, proceed to the final step.  Hermit crabs are not actual hermits. They are very social creatures that like another hermit crabs to keep it company. Its best off to get around five hermit crabs so that you can witness its social behaviors. Hermit crabs of all sizes, species and gender can happily be housed together. Try to get an active crab. Any crab that has antennae that flutters at varying speeds is generally healthy. Crabs that hang loosely when held are usually near death.   A healthy hermit crab withdraws quickly when picked up. Sometimes, hermit crabs do emerge when held, with antennae fluttering. This means the hermit crab is social and healthy. Try to pick these crabs. All you have to do now is add the crabs to the tank and you're all set!  

select an enclosure.  select a lid.  provide an appropriate substrate.  add decor and toys.  prepare the water.  dish the food.  select a heat source.  add shells.  prepare and wait.  get the hermit crabs! 

 Green is a popular color for mermaid tails, but you can make yours any color you want. The fabric needs to be long enough to cover your legs from waist to toes, plus extra.; , Have your feet stretched out in front of you, about shoulder width apart. The top edge of the fabric should be level with your wait, or however high you want the blanket to go.  When you reach your toes, make the tail come down to a point. Leave about 3 to 5 inches (7.62 to 12.7 centimeters) to either side of your legs and feet for wiggle room and seam allowances.The more space you leave around your legs, the roomier your blanket will be.   It would be easier to have someone help you do this. If you are by yourself, sit up and trace around your feet, legs, and hips, then lay down and trace up to your waist.If you are making this for someone else and they aren't available, use a pair of pants that fit them instead., Start cutting down the left side of your tail, from the top of your waist down to the toe point. Do not cut around the other side of the tail just yet.Pin the fabric to keep it in place as you cut.  The side that you already cut may not match up with the lines that you drew on the right. This is fine. Ignore the lines that you drew, and use the left side as a guide for cutting the right. This ensures that your tail is symmetrical., The fabric can be any color you want. It can be the same color as your tail, or a different one.  The bottom, pointed end of the tail should overlap the top edge of the fin fabric by about 9 inches (22.86centimeters).If this is for a child, the overlap could be smaller--about 6 inches (15.24 centimeters).  Start drawing the fins at the top edge of the fin fabric. Extend the pins past the 9-inch (22.86-centimeter) overlap. They can be any shape or size you want. Most mermaid fins are shaped like two leaves joined at the tip.You will be cutting your fins the same way you drew your tail, so you can draw half a fin if you'd prefer. Draw the fins a little bigger than you want them to be. You will need 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) for the seam allowance.  Next, use the lapping point from your tail to cut a V shape into your fins. When you are done, you should have a set of fins with a V shape cut into the top edge that is the same shape as size as the bottom 9 inches (cc centimeters) of your tail., This is not absolutely necessary, but it could give your tail a nice touch. Simply use a straight stitch on your sewing machine to sew a series of vertical lines going from the top of your fin piece to the bottom. Do this for the fin pieces separately. Do not topstitch them together.You can use a matching thread color or a contrasting one. For a more realistic touch, angle the lines slightly so that they are closer together at the top and wider at the bottom. Make the lines about 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) apart.  Pin the front fin piece to the front tail piece. Start pinning up one side of the point/notch, then down the other. Repeat this step for the back pieces.   Make sure that you are pinning the fabric with the right sides together. It may help to cut a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) slit into the bottom of the V on the fin.  For now, sew just the front fin piece to the front tail piece, and the back fin piece to the back tail piece. Use a 1 inch (2.54 centimeter) seam allowance and a stretchy stitch, such as a zigzag.Be sure to remove the pins as you sew.  Once you have sewn the fins to the tails, it's now time to pin everything together. Sew your first tail down, right side up. Place your second tail down on top, right side down. Pin around the edges.  Use a 1-inch seam (2.54 centimeters) allowance and a stretchy stitch. Leave the top edge open and remember to backstitch at the stat and end of your sewing.   Fleece does not fray, so you do not need to serge or finish the inside seams. Consider clipping the corners on the fin. This will help reduce bulk when you turn it inside out.  Fold the top edge inward by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Topstitch it down as close to the inside edge as you can using a stretch or zigzag stitch.   If you have any of your fin fabric left over, you can cut a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) wide bad out of it, and use it to make a band instead., Your blanket is now ready to use!  

fold some fleece fabric in half, right sides together.  lay down on top of the fabric.  trace around your legs, hips, and toes.  cut around the left side of the tail.  fold the fabric in half, then cut right side.  fold your fin fabric in half, right sides together.  overlap the tail and fin fabric.  draw your fins.  cut the fins out.  consider topstitching the fins.  pin the fins to the tail.  sew the fin and tail pieces together.  pin the two pieces together.  sew around the tail.  hem the top edge.  turn the tail inside out. 

 Assertive communication is the best way to interact with others. However, some people who are positive can come off as aggressive because they can end up hogging the conversation or talking about themselves too much. Assertiveness, as opposed to aggressiveness, is about being clear and respectful about your needs and desires without being aggressive (speaking loudly, talking excessively, yelling, etc).   Show a genuine interest in others. Avoid talking too much about yourself. Instead, ask questions. Use a calm and appropriate tone. Loudness can irritate people.Try not to interrupt others in conversation, or when they are doing something productive.Show affection properly. Sometimes touch can be annoying or unwelcome to others.  Sometimes super positive people can try to jump too fast into saying something positive to another person when the individual is hurting emotionally.   For example, if your friend just had a fight with her boyfriend, telling her, “Don’t worry about it so much,” might be invalidating. However, saying something like, “I know you are sad right now and that makes sense.” Don’t assume you know how someone else is feeling even if you have been in the same situation., If your friend is feeling sad, avoid smiling at her or trying to make her laugh (unless she wants you to). Instead, look concerned and interested. You don’t have to feel sad yourself, but mirroring her emotions can help her feel close to you and believe that you understand what she is going through.   Curb your enthusiasm around individuals who might be more quiet.  The most important component of using humor in a positive way is to know your audience. In order words, telling a dirty joke to a 3 year old may be inappropriate.   Avoid racist or sexist jokes especially if you know others might be sensitive to these types of topics. Avoid teasing others in an offensive way.Pay attention to reactions and act accordingly.  

demonstrate assertiveness.  validate others.  mirror the emotions of others.  use humor appropriately. 

 For small items, fill a sink with warm water and add a teaspoon (5 ml) of liquid dish soap. Wash the item in the sink using a cloth. For larger items, fill a bucket with soap and water. Soak a sponge or cloth in the soapy water and use the sponge to clean the item.         Cleaning is a must before you paint any surface, because it will remove dust, dirt, and other particles that could prevent the paint from adhering.; , After cleaning, rinse the item with clean water to remove dirt and soap residue. Pat the item dry with a towel or cloth to absorb excess water. Leave the item to air dry for at least 10 minutes, or until all the water has evaporated.  When the item is completely dry, use a piece of fine-grit sandpaper to lightly sand the entire surface. Sanding will rough up the surface slightly, and this will give the paint something to stick to.         A fine grit sandpaper is one with a grit between 120 and 220.Sanding is especially important if the item you're painting was previously painted. Remove as much of the original paint as possible with the sandpaper.  Use a microfiber, lint-free, or tack cloth to wipe down the plastic.This will remove dirt, dust, and plastic particles from sanding. Leftover dust and other debris on the surface will prevent the paint from sticking to the surface, because the paint will land on the dust particles rather than the plastic.  Spray paint is dangerous to inhale, and the overspray and dust can easily land on nearby surfaces. Take the item you want to spray paint outside when possible, such as when the temperature is mild, when there's no precipitation, and when it’s a calm day.   The ideal temperature range for spray painting is between 64 and 77 F (18 and 25 C).The ideal humidity for spray painting is between 40 and 50 percent.When you can’t spray paint outside, take the project to a shed or garage if possible.  Inhaling spray paint is bad for your health. To protect yourself, open windows, doors, and turn on exhaust vents when you must work inside. Don’t turn on any fans, as these will just blow the paint around.   Invest in an activated carbon mask if you work with spray paint often. This will protect your lungs and keep you safe from the health problems associated with spray paint exposure., A spray paint booth protects surrounding areas from overspray, and protects the painted item from dust and dirt when it’s still wet. For smaller projects, you can make your own simple spray paint booth with a box and a pair of scissors:   Find a box that’s larger than the items you're spray painting Cut off the flaps that form the lid Lay the box on its side with the opening facing you Cut off the top panel Leave the bottom, side, and back panels of the box in place Place the item in the center of the bottom panel  , For larger projects, you may not be able to make your own spray paint booth. To protect the floor and surrounding areas from overspray, lay out a large drop cloth or piece of cardboard. Place the item in the center of the cloth or cardboard.If you also want to protect the drop cloth from excess paint, lay down some newspaper over the cloth and place the item on the newspaper.  Different materials require different types of paint, and plastic typically needs a special type of spray paint. The wrong type of paint may blister, bubble, flake, or just won’t adhere properly to the surface. Look for spray paints that are specifically formulated for plastic surfaces, or that are suitable for plastics.   Companies that make spray paint for plastic include Krylon, Valspar, and Rustoleum., Shake the can of spray paint. Hold the can 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46 cm) from the object. Aim the nozzle at the object and press down. As you spray, sweep the can back and forth over the object in a vertical or horizontal motion to apply a thin and even coat to the surface.          Avoid pointing the nozzle directly, at a single spot, as this will make for an uneven application. Instead, keep the can in motion as you spray., Spray paint typically requires anywhere from eight to 30 minutes to dry. After applying the first coat, let the paint dry before applying a second coat, or before turning the item over to paint the other side.          Consult the manufacturer’s directions on the can for exact drying times with the paint you're using., Most items will benefit from at least two coats of spray paint. When the first coat has had time to dry, apply a second coat. Use the same side to side or up and down sweeping motion as you spray to ensure a thin and even coat.          When the second coat has been applied, give the paint up to 30 minutes to dry before assessing whether it needs another coat, or before painting the other side.  Some objects have a bottom or other side that won’t be accessible when you're applying the initial coats of paint. When the final coat has had time to dry, turn the object over. Apply two coats of spray paint using the same technique, giving the paint up to 30 minutes to dry between coats.  Paint generally has a drying time and a curing time. While spray paint dries in about 30 minutes, it needs about three hours to cure. Once you’ve applied the final coat of spray paint, let the item dry for at least three hours before using it normally again.          With spray painted furniture, for instance, don’t sit in the chair as soon as it’s dry. Instead, wait a few hours so the paint can fully cure.The drying time is how long it takes for the paint to be dry to the touch. The curing time, on the other hand, is how long it takes for the paint molecules to fully bond and harden.  

clean the plastic.  rinse and dry the item.  sand the surface.  wipe the surface.  take the project outside if possible.  ventilate indoor areas.  make a diy spray paint booth.  cover surrounding areas.  choose the right paint.  apply a coat of paint.  let the coat dry.  apply a second coat.  repeat on all sides.  let the paint cure. 

 Fend off tension and stress by exercising a few times a week. Go for a jog or hit the gym to work off extra negative energy caused by stress.Yoga is another good option for relaxing your body and relieving stress.  When you are not well-rested, you are not as well-prepared to handle stress. Aim to get around 7-8 hours of sleep every night to ensure that you feel tip-top in the morning.  Give your body good nutrition by eating plenty of fruits and vegetables. Avoid refined sugars and refined carbohydrates., Eat breakfast every morning, and have small, frequent meals throughout the day to keep your energy level up.  Feeling dehydrated can drag your energy levels down, which can compromise how you handle stress. Drink 6-8 eight-ounce glasses of water every day to ensure that your body is hydrated.If you eat fruits and vegetables, this will raise your fluid consumption. You get approximately 20% of your daily fluid intake from the foods you eat.  While alcohol and cigarettes might feel like momentary stress reducers, they can actually cause or increase anxiety and worry. Don’t rely on these to get you through stressful days., Taking time every day to meditate, even for 5-10 minutes, can help reduce stress levels and reduce negative thinking, especially for high-pressure jobs like nursing and firefighting., To meditate, sit comfortably and close your eyes. Breathe deeply, inhaling for a count of 4. Hold your breath for a count of 4, and exhale for a count of 4. Focus on your breath, repeating this process. When your mind starts to wander, refocus on your breath, and continue counting out your breaths.  

exercise regularly.  get 7-8 hours of sleep every night.  eat well.  drink plenty of water.  moderate your alcohol and nicotine consumption.  try meditation.

 Adding zero to a number does not change its value.  For example, if I have 6 apples, and you have 0 apples, together we have 6 apples:6+0=6{\displaystyle 6+0=6} ; , The commutative property states that numbers can be added in any order.  For example, 7 apples plus 4 apples is the same as 4 apples plus 7 apples. They both equal 11 apples:7+4=4+7{\displaystyle 7+4=4+7}11=11{\displaystyle 11=11}   , Use the commutative property and start with the larger number, then count up the value of the smaller number.  This strategy works best when one of the addends is less than five.  Students can use their fingers or manipulatives to keep track of how many they count on.  For example, to calculate 7+3{\displaystyle 7+3}, begin with 7 and count on three: “Seven, eight, nine, ten.”   , Use the commutative property to make a ten, then add the remaining number.  For example, to calculate 3+6+7{\displaystyle 3+6+7}, first make a ten by adding 7 and 3, then add 6:3+6+7{\displaystyle 3+6+7}(7+3)+6{\displaystyle (7+3)+6}(10)+6=16{\displaystyle (10)+6=16}   , A double is an addition sentence that adds a number to itself.  Adding a number to itself yields a number twice as big as the original number, so if students know how to multiply by two, they can use multiplication to help them add.  For example, students can memorize doubles up to 10:1+1=2{\displaystyle 1+1=2}2+2=4{\displaystyle 2+2=4}3+3=6{\displaystyle 3+3=6}4+4=8{\displaystyle 4+4=8}5+5=10{\displaystyle 5+5=10}6+6=12{\displaystyle 6+6=12}7+7=14{\displaystyle 7+7=14}8+8=16{\displaystyle 8+8=16}9+9=18{\displaystyle 9+9=18}10+10=100{\displaystyle 10+10=100}    , A doubles plus one is an addition sentence that would be a double, except one number is one larger than the other. Once students have their doubles memorized, they can simply add 1 to the doubles sum.  For example, if a student knows that 6+6=12{\displaystyle 6+6=12}, they can recognize that 6+7=13{\displaystyle 6+7=13}, because 6+7=6+6+1{\displaystyle 6+7=6+6+1}.  Students can use skip counting when adding by twos, fives, or tens.  Students should recognize that any even number plus two will equal an even number, and any odd number plus two will equal an odd number.For example, 5+5+5{\displaystyle 5+5+5} is the same as skip counting by fives three times: “Five, ten, fifteen.”   ,  For example, to calculate 29+9{\displaystyle 29+9}, calculate:29+10=30{\displaystyle 29+10=30}30−1=29{\displaystyle 30-1=29}   ,  For example, to calculate 58+32{\displaystyle 58+32}, you can break up 58 into 50+8{\displaystyle 50+8}, and you can break up 32 into 30+2{\displaystyle 30+2}. Then you can use the commutative property to add compatible numbers first:50+8+30+2{\displaystyle 50+8+30+2}(50+30)+(8+2){\displaystyle (50+30)+(8+2)}80+10=90{\displaystyle 80+10=90}   ,  For example, to find 58+32{\displaystyle 58+32}, you could subtract 2 from 30, then add 2 to 58.58+32{\displaystyle 58+32}(58+2)+(32−2){\displaystyle (58+2)+(32-2)}60+30=90{\displaystyle 60+30=90}   , The result will be the answer, or difference.  Students can use their fingers or manipulatives to count on.  For example, to calculate 8−6{\displaystyle 8-6}, start with 6 and see how many you have to count on to get to 8: “Six, seven, eight.” You counted on 2, so 8−6=2{\displaystyle 8-6=2}.   When subtracting with pencil and paper you usually start from the ones place. When using the front end strategy, you work beginning from the other direction.  This strategy only works when you do not have to borrow from other place values. You will know that the problem requires no borrowing if, when you line up the place values of each number, all the digits you are subtracting are smaller than the digits you are subtracting from.  For example, to calculate 795−463{\displaystyle 795-463}, you would first subtract the hundreds place, then the tens place, then the ones place:7−4=3{\displaystyle 7-4=3}9−6=3{\displaystyle 9-6=3}5−3=2{\displaystyle 5-3=2}So 795−463=332{\displaystyle 795-463=332}.   You can also use this strategy to break up numbers into hundreds and tens, or larger place values, for easier subtraction.  For example, to calculate 42−24{\displaystyle 42-24}, break up 24 into 20 and 4:42−24{\displaystyle 42-24}(42−20)−4{\displaystyle (42-20)-4}(22)−4=18{\displaystyle (22)-4=18}   , A number multiplied by 0 will always equal 0.  For example, 5 apples zero times is zero: 5×0=0{\displaystyle 5\times 0=0}.  A number multiplied by 1 will always equal the number.  For example, 5 apples 1 time is 5: 5×1=5{\displaystyle 5\times 1=5}.  The shortcut is that, when multiplying any number by a multiple of ten, simply add the number of zeroes in the multiple to the other number.  For example:27×10=270{\displaystyle 27\times 10=270}27×100=2,700{\displaystyle 27\times 100=2,700}27×1000=27,000{\displaystyle 27\times 1000=27,000}   , The associative property states that you can change the order of groupings you multiply first.  For example, to calculate 27×5×2{\displaystyle 27\times 5\times 2}, multiplying the 5 and 2 first will make a ten, which makes the problem easier:27×5×2{\displaystyle 27\times 5\times 2}27×(5×2){\displaystyle 27\times (5\times 2)}27×(10)=270{\displaystyle 27\times (10)=270}   , To do this, whenever you are multiplying a number by 5, multiply by 10 instead, and then half the product.  For example, to calculate 27×5{\displaystyle 27\times 5}, change the problem to 27×10{\displaystyle 27\times 10}, then divide the answer in half:27×5=12(27×10){\displaystyle 27\times 5={\frac {1}{2}}(27\times 10)}27×5=12(270){\displaystyle 27\times 5={\frac {1}{2}}(270)}27×5=135{\displaystyle 27\times 5=135}   ,  For example, to calculate 125×8{\displaystyle 125\times 8}, you can factor 125 as 25×5{\displaystyle 25\times 5} and 8 as 4×2{\displaystyle 4\times 2}. You can then use the commutative and associative property to multiply the factors in any order or combination. Thus:125×8{\displaystyle 125\times 8}(25×5)×(4×2){\displaystyle (25\times 5)\times (4\times 2)}(25×4)×(5×2){\displaystyle (25\times 4)\times (5\times 2)}100×10=1000{\displaystyle 100\times 10=1000}   ,  For example, to calculate 8×45{\displaystyle 8\times 45}, you could half the 8 and double the 45:8×45=4×90{\displaystyle 8\times 45=4\times 90}8×45=360{\displaystyle 8\times 45=360}   , To do this, break up the number you are dividing into smaller numbers that can easily be divided by the divisor. Then, sum the quotients.  For example, to calculate 104÷8{\displaystyle 104\div 8}, break up the 104 into 64 and 40:104÷8{\displaystyle 104\div 8}(64+40)÷8{\displaystyle (64+40)\div 8}(64÷8)+(40÷8){\displaystyle (64\div 8)+(40\div 8)}(8)+(5)=13{\displaystyle (8)+(5)=13}   , The shortcut is that, when dividing any number by a multiple of ten, simply subtract the number of zeroes in the multiple from the other number.  For example:27,000÷10=2,700{\displaystyle 27,000\div 10=2,700}27,000÷100=270{\displaystyle 27,000\div 100=270}27,000÷1,000=27{\displaystyle 27,000\div 1,000=27}   , Whenever you are dividing a number by five, you can instead divide the number by ten, then multiply the quotient by 2.  For example, to calculate 1230÷5{\displaystyle 1230\div 5}, instead divide 1230 by ten, then multiply the answer by 2:1230÷5=2(1230÷10){\displaystyle 1230\div 5=2(1230\div 10)}1230÷5=2(123){\displaystyle 1230\div 5=2(123)}1230÷5=246{\displaystyle 1230\div 5=246}   

understand the value of 0.  understand the commutative property.  add by counting on.  make a ten when adding three or more numbers.  memorize doubles.  recognize doubles plus one.  use skip counting.  think of plus 9 as plus 10 minus 1.to do this, whenever you add by 9, add by 10 instead, and then subtract 1 from the sum.  break up larger numbers to make compatible numbers.compatible numbers are numbers that are easier to add together.  balance numbers before adding.to balance numbers, you can subtract from one number and add the same amount to the other.  count on from the number you are subtracting (the subtrahend) to the number you are subtracting from (the minuend).  use the front end strategy for problems that require no borrowing.to do this,  subtract the digits beginning with the largest place value, ending with the lowest place value.  break up the subtrahend into tens and ones.then subtract your group of tens, then subtract the group of ones.  understand the value of 0.  understand the value of 1.  use the shortcut for multiples of ten.  use the associative property.  use the factor of 5 as half the factor of 10.  break up numbers into compatible factors.compatible numbers are numbers that are easier to multiply.  double one number and half the other.this is another way of finding compatible numbers that are easier to multiply.  use the distributive property.  use the shortcut for multiples of ten.  use the divisor 5 as half the divisor of 10. 

 Always wash fresh produce before eating it. Run your okra under tap water, turning it as necessary, to clean all sides. Shake off the okra to dry or dab it dry with paper towels., Start by slicing and discarding the stems on either end. Then, slice the okra into thin, round slices.Use a chef's knife or paring knife to slice the okra.  Okra sometimes comes out a little slimy. To prevent this, soak your okra slices in vinegar after cutting them. Combine a cup of vinegar with a quart of water. Immerse your okra in this mixture. Allow it to soak for one hour., Do not cook wet okra. This can contribute to sliminess. Let okra air dry on a paper towel. If you need to cook your okra fast, you can pat it down with paper towel until it dries., Lightly salt as much water as you need to submerge all your okra. Place your pot over high heat and bring the water to a boil.Try drizzling some lemon juice in the water. Some people find this cuts down on sliminess and it can also add some flavor., Once your water is boiling, add your okra to the sauce pan. Cover the pan and set a timer. Okra takes between 8 and 10 minutes to cook.Okra should be soft and tender when it's done cooking.  Make sure you get all the water out. Use a colander to drain out all the water. Shake the colander if necessary to get out excess water. Okra is prone to sliminess, so keep it as dry as possible., Okra can be seasoned with a little butter, salt, and pepper. Boiled okra does not require a lot of seasoning, but if you prefer a particular flavor profile you can season the okra how you want. For example, you can add dried basil and garlic to your okra., Fried okra should be coated in flour, cornmeal, salt, and any spices you want. Mix half a cup of flour, half a cup of cornmeal, and half a teaspoon of salt together. Then, add a quarter teaspoon of any spices you want, such as black pepper or cayenne pepper.You should also prepare a liquid to coat the okra in first so the coating sticks. Beat one egg together with one egg with a tablespoon of milk.  Coat a pan with a light amount of cooking oil such as olive oil. Heat the the pan over medium high heat for a few minutes.To check if the oil is ready, toss a small bit of food into the pan. If it sizzles, the oil is ready to use.  One by one, coat your pieces of okra. Set them aside on a plate until they're all coated. Dip the okra in the egg milk mixture. Then, dip it in the flour mixture until all sides are evenly coated., Add as much okra to the oil as fits. Pieces of okra should not touch and have a little space around one another. Fry the okra for three to four minutes per side. Each side of the okra should be golden brown by the time it's done cooking., Use a slotted spoon to remove okra from the oil. Place your okra on a plate covered in paper towel. Allow the okra to cool for a few minutes before eating., 

wash your okra using tap water.  slice your okra.  soak the okra in vinegar.  dry your okra completely.  bring a pot of salted water to a boil.  cook the okra in the water.  drain the okra.  season the okra.  prepare a coating.  heat your oil.  coat your okra.  cook the okra.  remove the okra.  finished.  

 One way to eliminate thirdhand smoke is to get rid of all sources of smoke in your life. Smoke can linger on your clothes and hair even if you don’t smoke in the house, so don’t smoke in your car either.   Don’t allow any visitors to smoke in your home or car. Ask them to step outside if they must smoke. This includes cigarettes and electronic cigarettes.; , When you have visitors who smoke, ask them to wash their hands after smoking. They should wash their hands immediately after smoking so as not to spread any contamination. You should ask them to wash their hands again if they want to touch your small children.You may consider asking your visitors to change clothes after smoking so they don’t bring any contaminants into your home. You can ask your friends with long hair to pull their hair back when smoking to reduce the risk of thirdhand smoke in their hair.  When you travel, consider staying at smoke-free hotels. Ideally, you should stay in a hotel that has always been smoke-free. Hotels that have been converted to smoke-free facilities may still smell like smoke and have thirdhand smoke in the air or in furniture.If you are visiting a friend who smokes, choose to stay in a hotel instead of the home of a smoker.  Consider installing a HEPA air cleaner if the home has been lived in by smokers for a long period of time. You should wash the walls, ceilings, carpets, curtains, and blinds before using the air purifier. You should also repaint the walls and replace the carpet. If you try to use an air purifier without the cleaning, painting and replacing, it is not likely that any purifier could handle the load.Ozone air purifiers should only be used when no one is home. The rooms should be well-vented before re-entry. Ozone can destroy some of the odor and purify the air, but ozone is not completely safe either. Make sure to read the directions when using an ozone air purifier and use as directed. Air filters can cover the lingering smell of smoke, but it does not mean that the thirdhand smoke has been eliminated.  You can place air-purifying plants around your home to help clean the air. The plants won’t remove particulates, but they can remove various gases and volatile substances. These plants include:Garden mum removes ammonia, benzene, formaldehyde, and xylene. Spider plants remove formaldehyde and xylene.  Dracaena remove benzene, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene, and xylene. Be aware that Dracaena is toxic to pets. Ficus removes benzene, formaldehyde, and trichloroethylene. Peace lily removes ammonia, benzene, formaldehyde, and trichloroethylene. Boston fern removes formaldehyde and xylene. Snake plant removes benzene, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene, and xylene. Bamboo palm removes benzene, formaldehyde, and trichloroethylene. Aloe vera removes formaldehyde.  

refrain from allowing anyone to smoke in your home or car.  ask visitors to wash their hands after smoking.  stay at smoke-free hotels.  use an air purifier.  buy air-purifying plants. 

 Sometimes stadiums or music venues will put out job ads for a large event that they are having. Having this experience may open the doors for you to apply to future positions if you do well. Visit popular job boards like Craigslist and Indeed and search for tour roadie or crew member jobs. Alternatively, you can look up positions at local theaters like production assistant or stage crew and get experience with a local theater.   Jobs that are available at venues or stadiums include janitorial staff, lighting and sound engineers, event planners, security, set up and break down crews, ticket cashiers, and food staff.Sometimes when venues need general help they won't require any previous experience. Look for venues that need help as soon as possible as they will be more likely to hire someone with no experience.  There are several roadie specific job boards that contain listings for jobs related to roadies. Sometimes these websites will require you to create an account before you can view open positions.Make sure that you have an updated resume and choose jobs that meet your level of experience.   Some of the most popular roadie specific job boards include, Roadiejobs.com and Crewspace.com.  Try to find the contact information of your favorite band on their website, or look for the manager's information and contact them to see if they need any help on the road. Long hours and intense travel mean that many people can't live the roadie lifestyle. For this reason, you may be able to get a job on the road with your favorite band even if it seems unrealistic.   You can search for band's contact information using popular search engines, however many times response rates are low.Try reaching out to the band or crew manager via social media to see if there are any job openings.  Talk to friends that are involved in the music industry and ask them if they know of any jobs that are available in the field. If you know bar or venue owners, they may be able to make an exception for you and provide you a job with no experience. If you went for your formal education, past teachers or mentors could also point you in the right direction.   You can say something like, "I'm having a hard time finding a job. Do you know of anyone that needs a good lighting person right now?"  , Once you have the proper experience in the field that you enjoy, try to develop a team of crew members. Select people that have experience and knowledge in places that you don't. Many people are looking for lighting, sound, or visual technicians and will regularly contract work out to them.Create a business page and a website so that venues and bands can reach out to you. Network with existing contacts to see if there's anyone that's in search of your skills. Once you get a couple of jobs under your belt, see if your prior customers can refer you to other businesses that need your services. If you have a reliable and knowledgeable crew, it will be easy to take on projects that require a lot of different types of work. You may also want to obtain a business license for your crew. Since you won't always be on tour, you'll need to be able to supplement your tour work with work that you can do while you're off-tour. The more jobs you get as a freelancer the more reputable your work will become.  

apply to gigs at music venues or stadiums.  search for job openings on roading-specific job boards.  reach out to your favorite bands to see if they need help.  use your networking connections to get a job.  set up your own crew and do contract work. 

 Make sure you choose an outfit that's flattering on your body type. Something that genuinely fits is key. However, if you want to get noticed, it's okay to wear clothing that's slightly more sexual or revealing. You may want to wear clothing that's a little tighter than your normal style, if you feel comfortable doing so.   Do not pick something that shows everything off, but do choose something that compliments your best features. If you prefer a low-cut front, for example, don't also go for a lower cut back. If you're proud of your back muscles, go for something low-cut in the back but higher in the front.A suit can be great club wear, if you choose one that's not too dressy. A blue suit jacket, for example, worn without a tie can be a nice club outfit.You can also go casual, but make sure to pick something flattering. Fitted jeans can help you show off your legs or, if you're curvier, your curves. A tighter t-shirt can work great. If you want to add a splash of formality, wear a nice blazer over a fitted t-shirt.; , Wear shoes that you love. Uncomfortable shoes that are difficult to dance in are not the shoes you want to wear at the club. Choose something that goes well with your outfit and is stylish. Most clubs are dark. People aren’t usually going to be looking at your feet.Select a comfortable shoe like flats or sneakers. This will allow you to dance flirtatiously, getting a guy's attention.  Keep in mind that if you’re dancing, sweat is likely. Wear makeup and a hairstyle that is going to stay in place through the night. For makeup, you might want to change your normal daytime style to something more dramatic -- stronger colors, smokier, more shine, etc.You can also opt for waterproof makeup products, as this may stay intact more throughout the night. You can use hairspray to keep your hair neat throughout the night.  

wear something flattering.  choose shoes you can dance in.  do your hair and makeup. 

 Before you begin to make your borax and vinegar paste, make sure you have all your supplies. You will need some items for mixing your paste, as well as all the ingredients.You will need a spray bottle. Buy an empty spray bottle from the grocery store and use this to mix your ingredients. You will also need borax, vinegar, dish soap, and boiling water.  Add 1 tablespoon of Borax, 1/2 cup vinegar, 1/8 cup of dish soap, and 1 cup of boiling water to your spray bottle. Shake the bottle vigorously until all the ingredients are evenly combined. You may have to shake the bottle for a few minutes until the ingredients are mixed., Before applying this cleaner, you should sprinkle a little baking soda inside your oven. A thin sprinkling of baking soda will make the cleaner more effective. It will also remove any unwanted smells from the oven in addition to cleaning it., This cleaner will not work in small amounts. This cleaner is most effective if you use it in a very thick layer on your oven. Spray on almost the entire bottle to your oven, targeting areas that are very dirty in particular. 

get your supplies together.  combine your ingredients in a spray bottle.  use this cleaner with a little baking soda.  make sure to use a very thick layer of this cleaner.

 You will need to open a port on your router that points to the IP address of the computer hosting the VPN. Enter your router’s IP address into a web browser address bar. This is typically 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, or 192.168.2.1. Refer to your router’s documentation for details.   Navigate to the Port Forwarding section. This may be labeled Virtual Servers or Applications. Create a new port forwarding entry. Set the external port to something random, such as 23452. Set the internal port to 1723. Forward to port to the IP address of the computer running the VPN server.  You can access this directly by searching for “ncpa.cpl”. Click on the result in the search list.  Click File and select “New Incoming Connection”.  By default, the list will include users registered on your Windows network. You can add other users by clicking the “Add someone…” button. You can create new usernames and passwords this way.  This will allow users to access the VPN using any internet connection.  Depending on who you are giving access to your VPN to, you may want to disable “File and Printer Sharing” to protect the security of your files. If you are using the VPN to access your files remotely, leave this checked.  Connecting users will need to enter this when they make the connection to the VPN.  Open the Network Connections window again (ncpa.cpl). Your VPN connection should appear in the list, and will notify you if other clients are currently connected to it. 

configure your router.  open the network connections window.  press the alt button to show the menu bar.  determine which users can connect to the vpn.  check the “through the internet” box.  decide whether or not to share your files.  copy down the computer name.  check your vpn connection. 

 At the undergraduate level, philosophy majors usually study a mix of different philosophies from the historical and/or theoretical perspectives.Two-year associate programs in philosophy are somewhat rare since the study of philosophy can be applied to so many different areas of knowledge. As such, four-year bachelor programs taken at liberal arts institutions are more common. You will likely study both "continental" philosophy—the work of Greek and European philosophers—and "analytical" philosophy--mathematics, logic, and theoretical physics. Common areas of study include ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, and aesthetics.; , If you want to further your education in philosophy after obtaining a bachelor's degree, you can pursue a Master of Philosophy, also called a "Magister Philosophiae" (M.Phil.) degree.   Master's programs in philosophy usually take about two years to complete. For the most part, you will complete the same sort of work expected in a doctorate program. The primary difference is that you will not need to write a dissertation.  Obtaining a doctorate degree in philosophy can get somewhat complex since many different areas of study are awarded with a "doctorate in philosophy" (Ph.D.). You will need to do a little extra searching to find a doctorate program that focuses only on philosophy and no other subject.   Most Ph.D. programs focused on philosophy are labeled as degrees in "social philosophy" or "applied philosophy."  , Most students of philosophy will need to read through philosophical readings several times before they fully understand them. As you advance in your studies, you may work out your own system of reading. At the start, however, it can be helpful to work through a reading four times.   During the first reading, look at the table of contents, key points, and/or glossary, then quickly scan through the passage itself. Move quickly, reading one page in roughly 30 to 60 seconds. Underline terms and ideas that jump out at you in pencil. Mark any unfamiliar terms, as well. For the second reading, flip through the text at a similar pace, but stop to look up any terms or phrases you do not recognize and cannot define by context. Your focus should still be on identifying key terms and ideas. Check off paragraphs you think you understand in pencil, and mark those you do not understand with a question mark or "x." During the third reading, go back to the sections you marked with a question mark or "x" and read them in greater detail. Check them off if you reach an understanding, or mark them with a second question mark or "x" if you do not grasp their meaning. During the fourth reading, quickly review the text again to remind yourself of the main focus and key arguments. If you're reading for class, identify the marked passages you had difficulty with so that you can ask questions.  The only way to familiarize yourself with philosophy is to immerse yourself in the philosophical works of others. If you do not read philosophy, you will not be able to speak or write it.   When studying philosophy for a class or degree program, you should always do the readings assigned to you. Listening to others' interpretations of those readings in class is not a good substitution. You need to review and grapple with the ideas on your own instead of having others do the work for you. Reading on your own is also beneficial. As you become more familiar with different branches of philosophy, you can gradually begin selecting your own readings on potential topics of interest.  While most lasting works of philosophy offer truths and reasoning that can be used in modern times, each one also has its own cultural biases to take into account.   Think about who wrote it, when it was published, where it was published, its original intended audience, and the purposes it was originally developed for. Also ask yourself how it was received in its own time and how it has been received since then.  Some theses are obvious and explicitly stated, but many are not. You will need to consider the key passages and ideas you spotted during your first and second readings to help you determine the main idea the philosopher is trying to argue.   A thesis can be positive or negative, meaning that it can accept a particular philosophical idea or reject it. Identify the idea being addressed first. Then, use the writer's statements about that idea to figure out if the thesis is positive or negative.  Supporting arguments should back up the writer's thesis. You may already know a few if you had to work backwards to find the thesis, but you should comb through the key ideas of the work again to identify any you may have missed.   Philosophers usually use logical argumentation to support their theses. Ideas and patterns of thought that are clearly sound will be presented and used to support the thesis.  Not every argument presented will be a valid one. Question the validity of an argument by looking at the premises and inferences it is built upon.   Identify the premises and ask yourself if they are as true as the writer claims. Try to come up with a counter-example that proves the statement wrong. If the premises are true, ask yourself if the inferences derived from those premises are sound. Apply the pattern of reasoning to a different case and see if it holds up. If it does not remain valid, the inference is not sound.  Once you have examined all of the premises and inferences surrounding a thesis, you will need to evaluate how successful and true the idea is.   If all of the premises and inferences are sound and you can think of no logical argument against the thesis as a whole, you must formally accept the conclusion, even if you still do not believe it personally. If any of the premises or inferences are faulty, though, you can reject the conclusion.  Every paper you write will have a purpose. If you are writing an essay for a class, the question you need to address may already be provided. When this is not the case, though, you need to identify a single question or idea you want to tackle before you begin writing.   Make sure that you have a clear answer to your primary question. This answer will become your thesis. Your primary question may need to be divided into multiple sub-points, and each of these points will need its own answer. As you plot out these sub-points, the structure of your essay will begin taking shape.  As previously noted, your thesis will be derived from the answer you developed to your essay's central question. This thesis needs to be more than just a statement, though. You will need to show some line of reasoning leading up to it.  Anticipate counter-arguments to each point you make. Note these counter-arguments in your essay and explain why those objections are not valid or sound.   Only spend a fraction of your paper addressing these objections. The majority of the essay should still focus on explaining your own original ideas.  Before you actually write your piece, you should organize the ideas you plan to use. You can do so using any drafting or prewriting technique of choice, but outlines and cluster charts are often among the most helpful.Identify your thesis at the top of your chart or outline. Each major supporting argument should be given its own box in your chart or heading in your outline. Your secondary boxes or sub-headings should list points that further expand those main arguments—i.e., your premises and inferences.  When writing your essay, you should use concise, concrete language and write in an active voice.   Avoid unnecessary, flowery language meant to sound impressive and focus solely on providing meaningful content. Leave out anything unnecessary, for that matter. Irrelevant and repetitive material should be left out. Define your key terms and use them throughout your essay.  After you write your first draft, go back through and double-check your reasoning and your writing.   Weak arguments should be strengthened or cut from your paper. Poor grammar, disorganized thought processes, and cluttered paragraphs should be rewritten.  Making preparations in advance may not be possible when you enter into an expected philosophical dialogue, but usually, philosophical discussions that occur during your studies will be planned in advance.   Review the assigned materials for the discussion and draw your own conclusions based on sound reasoning. For unplanned dialogues, briefly review your knowledge of related concepts before actively entering into the discussion.  A philosophical dialogue would not be very interesting if everyone had the exact same ideas. There will be disagreements, but you should always be respectful of others and their ideas, even when trying to prove them wrong.   Show respect by listening thoroughly and trying to view opposing points as worthwhile ideas. When a conversation brings up a significant issue, the exchanges will likely become more passionate, and conflict can occur. You should still try to end the conversation on a positive, respectful note, however.  If the ideas being discussed are ones that you do not have strong opinions on or firm knowledge of, spend more time as an active listener than a speaker. Simply speaking is not enough. If the points you contribute are not sound ones, your contribution will not further the dialogue much.   Conversely, if you do have strong arguments to make, speak up. You should not try to override others, but you should definitely make your ideas and support known.  Insightful questions can be just as important in a discussion as sound arguments.   Ask for clarification on any point another person makes when it seems hazy to you. If you have a point that no one else has addressed yet, but do not have a firm stance on it, bring that point up as a question.

 Dampen a paper towel or some gauze. Squeeze out any excess water. Gently wipe the inner surface of your cat’s ear. This will prep its skin for the transdermal gel.Try not to stick the gauze into your cat’s ear canal.  You can either place it on your lap, the bed, a couch or a chair. Stabilize your cat with one hand.If your cat seems anxious, pet and talk to it in a soothing voice until it is calm.  This way you can prevent the medication from absorbing into your skin and body. Use latex gloves or a finger glove, i.e., a finger cot.If you are using a finger cot, make sure to place one on your index finger and one on your thumb.  Make sure to dispense the correct dosage. Follow the directions per the instructions on the bottle in order to dispense the correct dosage., Apply the gel onto the inner surface of your cat’s ear, i.e., the area that you wiped clean. Gently massage the gel into the inner surface of the ear with your index finger. Massage it in until it is completely absorbed.Do not apply the gel onto abraded or broken skin. Use a different ear each time you apply the gel.  Use a paper towel to do this to avoid getting any medication on your skin. Discard the gloves in a separate trash bag and place it in your trashcan outside. Then wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap.If you have other pets and/or children, place your cat in a separate room for 15 minutes. This way you can prevent your cat from spreading the medication to your pets and/or children.

 Before you look at what you want to do, think about what you're trying to achieve. This can give you a good starting point, a sort of light at the end of the tunnel.   Do you want to brainstorm for your business? Are you trying to come up with an idea for you next work of art? Maybe you're trying to come up with an idea for an article you have to write?; , If you have a teacher, boss, client, or someone that will be evaluating your work, find out what they're expecting or what they need. If not, just think about the limitations you must work within and what the final product should accomplish. While breaking requirements can sometimes result in a better experience and final product, knowing all of the limitations will give you a good framework to start working in.   For example, do you need to keep to a certain budget? Do you need to use only certain materials? Does the project need to be done by a certain time?  , You'll naturally be assuming some things about your project. What are people looking for? What are your limitations? What is acceptable or normal? What should it generally look like? List these assumptions so that you can play on them later.   For example, with an art project, we might assume that people are looking for a particular color scheme that fits with the theme of a gallery show. For a business project, we might assume that customers are wanting a particular something that our competitor's product does not provide.  Take a hard look at what you've done in the past, what you've done already, and what you have available to you in terms of resources. This will help give you some boundaries to work with.   What kind of tools do you have to use? What materials or people have you not made use of in a long time? What was something you tried last year and how could it be better? Ask others for their opinions.  Do some research on what people working on similar projects have been doing. Google is your friend in this adventure. You should not be looking at what others are doing in order to copy them. Instead, you should be seeing where their ideas fall short or what pieces of their project might fit into yours.  Once you see what run-of-the-mill folks are doing, find out what the innovators are doing. Seek out the cutting edge and fringe ideas or techniques that other people are experimenting with. You might want to similarly experiment! Such innovation can set you apart, making what you do unique, memorable, and appealing.  Get outside of your usual environment. This is a great way to break yourself out of the standard creation loop and think of things that you've never thought of before. Go for a walk, go to a local artisan or farmer's market, or work in a cafe for awhile. Any change of environment can help you think in different ways.  Always have a journal next to your bed. You'll also want to keep a waterproof note-taking option in your shower area. Good ideas often sneak up on us when we're doing these other activities, but then get lost as we get distracted with whatever else it is we're doing. By having a pen and paper nearby, you'll be able to quickly jot down the things you think of before they fly away!  , It's important to take breaks, to keep your mind clear of negative response loops. A lot of the time, when you're thinking and coming up with nothing, you get too focused on the fact that you're coming up with nothing, making it impossible to really think.   Try having a healthy snack, catch up with a coworker, or do a quick chore (such as cleaning up your mess from dinner).  During the brainstorming process, criticism isn't helpful. You'll need the freedom of minimal boundaries in order to get to new ideas. Leave criticism for once you have a long list of possibilities.   If you're brainstorming with other people, you might need to remind some people to keep negative opinions to themselves until the brainstorming activity is done.  Don't try to brainstorm with just a cold start. This is like breaking out into a full run without a light jog first! Do a quick exercise that gets your head in that space, such as making a menu for your next week's worth of dinners, or coming up with a wish list of things you'd like to accomplish in work, school, or whatever it is you're doing.  Put yourself in the shoes of your competitor, looking at what you're doing now and trying to figure out how to be better than you. How would they look at what you're doing and do things better? What would they change? Where would they go next?  , Giving yourself new roadblocks to reaching your goal, such as a lower budget, a new deadline, or a specific material to be used, can make you more creative and innovative. It may even give you an idea if you couldn't come up with one before.  Mind maps are one of the most popular brainstorming techniques. This is where you write down an idea (or several!) on a notecard. Pin the note card to a wall and then build on the idea. Write down every little thing you think of and start connecting the ideas.  Create three categories: easy ideas, tough ideas, and crazy ideas. Try to come up with at least five ideas for each category. Usually, in coming up with ideas we think we can't or shouldn't actually carry out, we find ourselves with ideas that we actually can use.  Write a poem that describes what you're trying to do. You can also write a theoretical analysis or review of the thing you're hoping to create. By outlining what you're hoping to get out of the project, you may have an easier time thinking of ways to do it.  Take something you've done before, a long time ago, and find a way to update it. You can also take old concepts that aren't yours and find a way to bring them into this era. For example, Twitter was basically telegrams for the internet. Some of the most popular products right now make use of classic designs.  Online idea generators can be really helpful in getting you started, even if it's just used as a warm up. Don't feel burdened by or tied to the ideas that it gives you, but try to use them as a jumping off point. Try this:   http://ideagenerator.creativitygames.net/  , Always ask questions. Ask questions of yourself. Ask questions of the people you're brainstorming with. Ask questions of your friends and family members. Questions lead us to really think through things that we might have glazed over in our minds. Ask detailed questions and questions that really get at the heart of the issue. And don't go for the short, obvious answer.   Why do I want to paint with oils? Why does my customer want this product?  , There are lots of little exercises, like mind maps, that can be really useful. But a lot of the time they're also a distraction and can hold you back from really getting work done. Don't waste too much time on brainstorming activities, and instead try to just get down to business as quickly as possible.  Free writing is where you start writing and you just don't stop. This also involves some free association, where you naturally follow the course that your thoughts take instead of trying to direct the current. Just write down a sentence that deals with the topic you're trying to brainstorm on and then follow your brain, writing down every word that ambles through your internal dialogue without stopping to think. You never know where it will lead you!  

look at your goal.  understand any requirements.  list out and evaluate your assumptions.  evaluate what you have to work with.  do some research.  look at what the innovators are doing.  go somewhere.  keep a journal next to your bed.  take breaks!,  shut out criticism.  warm up.  change your perspective.  introduce roadblocks.  make a mind map.  create idea categories.  write a poem, analysis, or review.  bring an old technique into the new age.  use an online idea generator.  keep asking questions.  don't waste time.  do some free-writing. 

 Once you’re ready to talk to your friend about how their bragging is affecting your relationship, you’ll need to choose the best time to talk. Be mindful that your friend probably won’t like being told that they brag too much.Pick a time that works for your friend. Be considerate of their schedule so that they’ll realize that you value them. Make sure that you have enough time to talk it out. For example, avoid inviting your friend out for a quick drink at happy hour to discuss the bragging.  When you’re ready to talk to your friend, make plans to meet them in a neutral location, such as a favorite restaurant that you both enjoy.Avoid talking to them at a place that is normally child-centered, such as a little league game.   Have the conversation when it’s adult’s only so that your friend doesn’t have to choose between your conversation and caring for their child. Let them know that you need to talk to them. Say, “Hey, I’ve been feeling some distance between us lately, and I’d really like to talk about it.”Assure your friend that you care about his/her child. You could say, “Brennan is such a great kid! His talent speaks for itself.” Pick a location that you both like, preferably one where you’ve spent many great moments of your friendship.  While you may want to loosen up with a drink before talking to your friend, resist the urge. You don’t want to say something you regret in the heat of the moment, so stay away from the drinks until you’ve finished discussing your concerns about the bragging.  Focus solely on how your friend’s bragging is affecting your relationship.   Tell your friend how you feel using “I” statements. You could say, “I feel like your bragging takes away from our time together.”Avoid saying things like, “All you talk about is your kids!” or “You never listen to what’s going on in my life.” While you may feel this way, your friend will tune out your concerns.  The conversation involves just the two of you, so don’t try to speak for other friends, even if they’ve made comments about the bragging to you in the past.   Avoid statements like, “Everyone says that you brag too much.” This will just put your friend on the defensive. Don’t gang up on your friend. Only talk to your friend one-on-one.  Since the goal is to continue being friends, make sure that you don’t say something that will cause more damage to the relationship.Don’t tell your friend that you find them annoying, even if that is sometimes true. Don’t accuse your friend of bragging to cover up their own insecurities. Even if you are right, this will only cause more hurt, and it’s not your place to diagnose your friends.  After you've told your friend how you feel about their bragging, listen to what they have to say about the situation. Be open to how they feel.Ask your friend how they feel. Say, "I really want us to stay close. How are you feeling right now?" Even if they are upset with you, knowing how they feel will help you move forward. Realize that they may bring up an issue they've had with your behavior.  

choose a good time to talk.  set a friend date.  keep a clear head.  limit the conversation to how you feel.  don’t bring other friends into it.  consider your words.  listen to your friend. 

 To help improve the health of your sinuses, place a humidifier in your bedroom while you sleep. A humidifier produces steam and moist air, which will help clear out the nasal passages.When your nasal passages are blocked, you need to focus on keeping your nasal passages and sinuses moist. Although many people think that if you have have a runny nose, that dry air is the trick, dry air only further irritates the membranes in your nasal passage. Humidifiers are especially good during the wintertime because the air in most homes is very dry due to central heating.Even placing a hot water bottle near the ear may have a similar effect and help to draw out ear fluid.  Taking a long, hot shower works very similarly to the steam treatments described above. The hot water from the shower creates warm, moist air that is useful in clearing out blocked nasal passages and relieving sinus pressure.You also achieve a similar beneficial effect by placing a warm compress on your face to help open up your nasal passages and relieve any pressure you might be feeling in your sinuses., Make sure that you drink lots of water (at least 8 full glasses a day) because this will thin out your mucus and can help prevent sinuses blockages, and thereby ease pressure.Thinned out mucus is much more likely to drain. Whenever you feel the beginnings of sinus pressure, make a concerted effort to stay hydrated., When you go to sleep at night, place a couple of pillows beneath your head so that it is elevated. This will make breathing easier and keep the sinus pressure from building up. 

use a humidifier.  take hot showers.  drink fluids.  keep your head elevated. 

 Is it a particular relationship that is making you feel useless? Are you feeling useless because of a certain situation you have no control over? Do you feel useless because you don't feel like you're contributing to society in all the ways that you could? Identifying the cause of the feeling is the first step towards changing your life.   One way to explore your feelings is to write in a journal. Think about these questions as you write, and try to figure out what's bothering you. Alternatively, try talking over your problems with a trusted friend. Sometimes saying what you're feeling out loud can help you figure out what's wrong.; , Figure out what you're good at by exploring different hobbies and reading books. Seek out what makes you happy and what you can contribute with those skills so that you're offering something to the world.One way to explore interests is to take community college classes. These classes are relatively cheap, so you can spend a semester deciding if you really are passionate about an interest. Many community colleges offer night and weekend classes if you work full time. Alternatively, try classes at your local museums if you're interested in art or history. Another way to explore interests is to pick up a book from the local library. The books are free, and you can take your time learning about your interest. If you want to meet other people with the same interest, look on social media websites like Meetup and Facebook to find people in you area with the same interest.  Buy someone a cup of coffee. Bring your loved one her slippers without being asked. Offer a parking place to someone who looks stressed. The little things you do to help people everyday can help you feel needed., Volunteering is not only a solid way to make you feel useful, but you'll also be helping people out along the way. Choose something you love for your volunteerism. If you love books, offer time at the library. If you like working with kids, offer to read to kids at your local YMCA after school., Focus on what's positive in your life. By focusing on what's good about your life, you may be able to overcome feeling useless or worthless. It keys you in to the positive side of things, so you have a happier outlook.One way to focus on what's going well in your life is to keep a gratitude journal. Write down five things everyday that you are grateful for in your life. Some people use social media like Facebook to the same effect--that is, they post five things they are grateful for everyday as a status update. Using social media can help you motivated with this project, as you'll likely receive positive feedback from friends.  Sometimes feeling useless can stem from low self-esteem. You may feel like you don't have anything to offer the world. However, take some time each day to acknowledge to yourself what you're doing right. You do make a difference to other people, and you should look for that in yourself every day.One way to build yourself up is to use your mirror to your advantage. Every morning, look yourself in the eye, and say something positive about yourself out loud.  In the same vein as talking to yourself positively, accept positivity from other people, especially when it is about something you do or who you are as a person. You may feel like you don't deserve the compliment, but people are usually sincere when they take the time to compliment you. Think about the contributions you're making that inspired those compliments.  If you are passionate about preserving our natural resources, go out and do something about it. Organize protests. Write letters. Talk to people. Fighting for what you believe in can help you to feel less useless because you are doing something to help your friends and country.  Steer clear of potential distractions like the computer, the TV, the phone, the cat, or the fridge. If you procrastinate, you won't accomplish anything. However, if you finish tasks you start, you're sure to feel more useful. Start with something small, like cooking dinner for your spouse, and work up to larger tasks, like cleaning out the garage.  Improve your self-confidence and value your time and your skills more. You're not going to get a sense of purpose if you're not caring for yourself enough. Don't sell yourself short, and take time out to rest and relax when you need to do so.   One way to value yourself is to say "no" to requests that you don't have the time or energy to do. If you divide yourself too thinly, you won't be able to contribute as fully to each task.  Be active in the way you listen. That is, pay attention to what the other person is saying rather than preparing what you are going to say in your head. Be interested in what the other person has to say and respond in a way that shows you heard., Acknowledge what the people in your life do for you. That acknowledgement shows them that you notice what they do for you and that you appreciate their effort.  Your presence is one of the best gifts you can provide for the people you love. It tells them you care about them., Instead of laughing at your boyfriend for crying, let him know you appreciate his emotional honesty. Instead of making fun of your friend for dancing silly in the kitchen, join in the fun., Some relationships will never work well no matter what you do. If another person is being emotionally abusive or just doesn't want to make time for you, it may be time to edge away from that person. You may feel useless in a situation like this one because you may feel like you've failed. However, it could be that you are just not compatible with the other person, not that you have failed to contribute to the relationship. Maybe the other person has issues he or she needs to deal with before she is in any kind of relationship, so you shouldn't place the blame on yourself.  You may not be able to solve the situation--your mother is still going to be sick no matter what you do. However, you can be there for her. You can show up when you're needed. You can offer support and encouragement. It may not be dealing with the problem as you'd liked to do, but you will be doing something, which can help alleviate your feelings of uselessness., You can pray, meditate, or just take a few deep breaths, but whatever way, take a moment to calm yourself down. Accept that you do not have control over the situation.  Your mother may be sick, but you can take the time you are spending with her to develop a better relationship with her than you've had in the past., Even if it doesn't change anything, it will help others realize that they aren't the only ones who are dealing with these feelings, which is a way you can provide support. It also opens up the discussion, so others have a chance to take about their feelings, as well., Long-term stressful situations can lead to depression, and feeling useless could be a symptom of depression, especially if it is accompanied by other symptoms.   Symptoms of depression include having trouble focusing, feeling pessimistic, not being interested in things you usually enjoy, feeling guilty, being extra tired, being consistently sad, and even experiencing physical symptoms like headaches or stomach aches.Feeling sad on occasion doesn't mean your depressed. Depression is a sustained period of not caring and feeling sad. When symptoms start to overrun your life, you may be depressed.  If you are depressed, you may need medication, or you might need to seek out counseling to help you work through some issues, which may help alleviate your feelings of uselessness. Remember, being depressed is not a sign of weakness. It can be caused by a traumatic event in your life, but it could also be a chemical imbalance that needs to be corrected. Also, certain medications, your genes, and other problems like illnesses can also lead to depression. 

try to identify the source of the feeling.  find your passion.  do something nice everyday.  volunteer in your community.  practice gratitude.  talk to yourself in a positive manner.  accept compliments.  contribute to causes you care about.  try not to procrastinate.  take good care of yourself.  listen better to other people.  be appreciative.  be there for the people in your life.  celebrate what makes the other people in your life unique instead of shaming them for it.  break free from relationships that are harmful.  do what you can.  if you're in the middle of a stressful situation, take some time to stop and breathe.  focus on what's going well, and work towards making that a larger part of your life.  talk about what you're feeling with others in the situation.  check yourself for signs of depression.  see a doctor if you suspect you are depressed. 

 You can try relieving the symptoms of a yeast infection at home by sitting in a warm bath or a sitz bath. A sitz bath is a small pan or bowl that is made to allow your hips and buttocks to be soaked in water. Soaking in a warm bath can help to reduce your symptoms and being relief to your vaginal area., Another option is to put a cool, damp cloth on your lower abdominal area or on your vaginal area to help reduce your symptoms. Let the cloth sit on this area until you feel relaxed and any soreness goes away. Replace the cloth periodically so the area stays clean., Though your vaginal area may feel itchy or irritated due to the yeast infection, you should try not to rub the area. Rubbing or scratching the area can make the infection worse. Instead, try to use other options to relieve your symptoms. If the area becomes very itchy or irritated, you may want to speak to your doctor. 

sit in a warm bath.  apply a cool, damp cloth to the area.  avoid rubbing the area. 

 Depending on the size of the object you plan to grind, you might use a grinding wheel, a sander, or even a sand blaster. A sander is best suited for minimal abrasion to break through a thin layer of copper. A grinding wheel will be more aggressive and help you cut through a thicker layer of copper, but the sandblaster will be ideal for removing copper from a larger object.   You should also consider the material underneath the copper. If you are dealing with a soft metal or plastic, a grinding wheel might do more damage than a sander or sand blaster.  Grinding removes the copper layer mechanically instead of chemically. This means that you will likely have to press pretty hard with a sander or grinding wheel. You should also be wearing goggles and a respirator.Inhaling metal shavings can be dangerous. Metal shavings can cut your eyes if they get in them.  Once you have removed the copper layer, you will notice grooves and marks left on the material underneath. This happens because once you break through the copper layer, you begin to grind the surface of the material. Smooth out the surface of the material by sanding those grooves down with a finer sandpaper, and wiping the surface clean.For example, you might use a 180 grit sandpaper to get out the initial scratches, and the move to a 300 grit sandpaper to smooth things out even more (a higher grit produces finer scratches).  If you are removing copper from the surface of another metal, you might need to polish that metal afterward. Most metals have specific polishes that you can buy commercially, such as aluminum polish or chrome polish. Apply the polish according to the manufacturer’s instructions to make your metal shine and protect it from the environment.  

select a grinding tool.  grind the copper from the surface.  smooth the material underneath.  polish any metal underneath. 

 For a nice warm foot bath, add 2 to 3 tbsp of salt to 300 to 500ml bucket of warm water.  Follow this habit at regular intervals till you don’t see the much anticipated results.  

prepare a salt water foot bath.  soak your feet in for up to 5 to 10 minutes. 

, When you squeeze the brake handle, each side of the caliper should advance toward the wheel the same. If one side has more movement than the other, you will need to ascertain the arms are moving freely and well lubricated. Tighten the spring on the side which moves the greatest amount by bending it with a pair of pliers, being careful not to nick the spring or break it.  

make sure the calipers are centered over the wheel.  ,  make sure the springs are equally tensioned on each caliper arm. 

 Start by visiting business.google.com. This is Google's business-specific website. In order to fully use the site, you will need to create a Google account or log into an existing one. This can be the account that you use for Gmail or Google Drive., Click on "start now" and then search for your business either by name or address. If you see your business listed already, you can claim it as your own. If you don't see it, click on "no, these are not my businesses" and you will be prompted to enter your own information., Input your address, phone number, and complete business name if it is not already present. Afterwards, you can add photos or other information, such as:   Up to 5 different categories to list your business Your hours of operation. What forms of payment you accept. What's really special about your business. A link to a video about your business if you have one., You can choose between having them call the telephone number listed in the ad or sending a postcard. The telephone method is much faster, and your ads will appear almost instantly if you verify using this method. The postcard method will take between 1 and 2 weeks and involves entering the verification number on the card., Businesses that are mobile or serve customers in their own homes can list themselves as an "area of service" business rather than as a physical storefront. To set yourself up in this way, log into your Google my Business account and go to "edit info." Click on "address" and then click the box for "I deliver goods and services to my customers at their locations" underneath the address box. From here, you can enter the cities or zip codes that your business serves. You can also input this information as radius around your location (within 50 miles of ___).   Some business listings may have to be re-verified if their address is changed., Regularly check over your information to make sure that it is up to date and accurate. Update your listing for news products/services, changes in your hours, and any other important information that may change over time. In addition, Google may draw information from third parties, like review websites, to add to your listing. Make sure this information is correct and delete or edit it if it is not., Google's business platform allows you to read reviews left by customers. Doing so can give you an idea of how you are doing and what you can improve. In addition, you can respond to these reviews as a verified business owner. In your responses, you can either work out a way to help a dissatisfied customer or thank a happy one for their business., Google also provides business owners with analytics that can help them identify their customers. The system tracks clicks on your profile for more information, to start navigation, and to call your business.

Adding videos will also help you earn more business., When a user searches Google for a certain service or product, Google comes up with a list of local businesses that meet their criteria. While the list used to show the top seven businesses in a group at the top of the page, they have now narrowed that number down to three. Users can click to see all results, but why do so when three good options are already listed? This is why it is important to work towards making that top three, especially if you have a lot of competition in your area., Arguably the most impactful way to move up to the rankings is to earn higher reviews than your competitors. The first step towards doing this is, of course, to offer spectacular products and services. This will drive customers to write reviews on their own. However, if you find yourself lacking in good reviews, there are a number of things you can do. First, respond to negative reviewers and try to work out some way to remedy their problem. Then, you can offer benefits to customers who review your business, like a small freebie or a discount.   Remember to always thank positive reviewers for their business by commenting on their review., Rankings are decided in a number of ways, but one of them is the popularity of the business's website (that is, how much traffic the site gets). Start by making sure that you have a professional website for your business and that the website is posted on your listing. Then, start creating original content for your website like articles, infographics, photos, and videos that are relevant to your business or customers. Try to syndicate this content to social media and other websites to increase traffic to your own site.   Create this content consistently and build momentum by drawing traffic back with more good content. Even if you don't make the top three listings this way, at least you will have built a highly-trafficked website.Incentivize other websites and businesses linking back to you. This is best accomplished through having good content on your site but your page rank and overall traffic will increase the more external places your links are posted.  Citations are listings for your business online. These can be on Facebook, Yelp, Yellow Pages, or any other service that lists local businesses. Having more citations can help you earn a top ranking.

If you are tall, try maybe a tube skirt and a blouse, or leggings and a dress top.; , Most schools have a set uniform and many are strict about them. Schools let girls wear stud earrings, so try a sparkly pair or some that match your eyes. Get in style shoes, although if you are tight for money then most clothes and shoe shops sell very cheap black ballet pumps. If your uniform is a skirt then don't wear it on your knees! The average length for teen girls is about 5 or 6 inches (12.7 or 15.2 cm) above the knee. You can also wear patterned tights or coloured ankle socks (if your school allows it.) If you wear a tie then make it short and pin some badges to it. Thin chain necklaces are a great way to add to the sparkle on your head area, especially If you have your hair up. Small rings, friendship bracelets and charity bands are cool too. Try wearing a vest underneath your school shirt/blouse and letting it hang out under your jumper.  Shower once everyday, or if you are sporty possibly twice a day. Wash your hair in the evening so it is dry when you wake up. Use deodorant and nice smelling soap/body wash. If you are allowed, you could shave your legs (you don't have to!)  , If you have straight hair, try a side fringe and a side parting or a scruffy bun with a fringe. If you have wavy or curly hair try a top knot or just leave it natural! If you fuss with frizzy hair to much, it looks even worse than when you started. All the steps so far have been about appearance, but that's not all you need to make people like you!  , Smile and laugh at jokes. It's good to make your own jokes once in a while as well, If you are upset about something at home or in school, tell people if they ask, instead of saying 'nothing', because then people will get the impression that there really is nothing wrong and you are just generally grumpy. People will like you if you relax and smile a lot.  Don't tell people to shove off or go away just because you are having a bad day and they try to talk to you. Help people with books, hold open doors and generally be helpful. If you are nice to them, they'll be nice to you.  Don't walk around the school grounds by yourself, find a group of people and walk around with them. If you are shy or uncomfortable in large groups, find one or two people who you think are nice and talk to them.  It's all very well being friends on a low level with everyone, but when it comes to the crunch then you need some real friends that you can rely on. It doesn't matter if they're boys or girls, as long as you like them and know you can trust them then they're a brilliant friend.  Find an activity that you enjoy in school (many girls like sports such as hockey, netball or tennis.) If you're not the sporty type, then try art or ceramic clubs. If there are other kids in your year doing this club, then you are bound to make friends with them.  If you find it hard in some subjects, ask for help or go to a homework club. It IS cool to work hard, and people will admire you for it.  Enjoy your time in year eight because its probably one of the best years of your school life. Just be yourself and everyone will like you for who you are.  

keep up to date with fashion.  accessorize your uniform.  be hygienic.  style your hair.  be happy.  be nice to people.  go where others go.  make a close group of friends.  join clubs and activities.  try to get good grades.  have fun! 

 Because most airlines have strict deadlines for claims, you should let the airline know the moment you realize your bags are not where they're supposed to be.For example, British Airways gives you 21 days to file a claim from the date of your flight to claim damages for baggage reported missing for more than three days, or expenses incurred as a result of missing baggage. However, you only have seven days from the date you receive your bag to file a claim for missing items, or for damage to the bag or its contents. The time is longer for international flights, but for domestic flights you may have only 24 hours to report the loss or damage of your bag or your claim will be denied.; , If you notify the airline that your bags are missing while you are at the airport, you should receive a reference number you can use to check the status of your claim.Make sure you provide the airline with a phone number where you can be reached, as well as the address where you will be staying. Don't put your home address or phone number if you're not at home. Typically you also will have the ability to check the status of your bag claim by checking online after you provide the airline with notification that it is missing. The airline representative who takes your report will give you more information.  You typically must provide a description of your bag, including its approximate size, color, and composition.Keep in mind that the details you provide also are intended to assist baggage handlers and other airline personnel in locating your bag. Be sure to include any particular details that set your bag apart from everyone else's and might make it easier to recognize.  If you had to purchase any items to replace those you'd packed in your lost baggage, the airline may reimburse you for those purchases.Some airlines provide a daily stipend to cover reasonable expenses you incur as a result of being without your bag. For example, Delta will give you a stipend of up to $50 a day for the first five days your bag is missing. Additional expenses may be covered depending on your situation.Airlines and travel guides typically recommend that you include toiletries and a change of clothes in your carry-on so you're prepared in the event your flight is delayed or your baggage is lost. #Calculate the value of your claim. The total value of your claim includes the value of the contents of your bag as well as the luggage itself.Keep in mind that you will have to provide proof that your bag and its contents are actually worth the amount you've entered. Without receipts, this can be exceedingly difficult – and you are unlikely to have receipts for items such as personal clothing you purchased months or even years before your trip. Typically your bag will be found after a few days. For this reason, many airlines such as Delta and American Airlines don't accept the claim form until your bag has been missing for five days., Creating a list of the items in your bag can assist you in calculating the value of your bag in the event the airline loses it.You also should consider taking an inventory of the items in the bags you plan to carry on with you, in case something is stolen. It can be difficult to remember exactly everything you had in your bag when you no longer have it. Keep in mind the relative value of the items you pack, and avoid taking something expensive when you have something less valuable that would fulfill the same need.  Photos can be used to back up your inventory and support your calculation of the value of your belongings.   Snapping a photo often is easier than making an itemized list of everything in your suitcase – just be careful if you've got some items covered by others or zipped away in pockets. Keep in mind that proving the value of your possessions can be very difficult without receipts. However, photos of the items in good condition can help prove a reasonable value.  Receipts are the easiest way to prove the value of something.If you've purchased something that has sentimental value as a souvenir of your adventure, consider carrying it on the plane with you if at all possible rather than including it in your checked bag. Particularly if you're going on a long trip, consider packing a soft-sided carry-on in your checked suitcase. The bag will lay flat and take up little room, but can be opened and used to pack the souvenirs and mementos you acquire over the course of your trip.  The airline will only pay up to a maximum dollar amount for your lost or damaged baggage, regardless of the total value of your claim.   For domestic flights, airlines are required to compensate you for the value of your bag and its contents, up to $3,300.If you're traveling internationally, your baggage is probably covered by the Montreal Convention, which requires airlines to compensate you up to around $1,750 for lost or damaged baggage. that total amount may vary depending on the exchange rate at the time of your travel. Other countries may have their own regulations that provide you with more or less compensation, depending on where you were flying and where the flight originated. In addition to the maximum dollar amounts, airlines may exempt certain items such as cameras or computer equipment in checked bags that can easily be damaged., The insurance you already have may provide additional coverage for the property you take with you when you travel.Your homeowner's or renter's insurance covers your property if it is lost or stolen, and may include luggage while you are on a trip. You should call your insurance carrier to make sure before you rely on this coverage. In some cases, your insurance company will pay you and then seek reimbursement from the airline. This generally is to your advantage, since you probably will get money to replace the lost items more quickly. Keep in mind that your homeowner's or renter's insurance policy likely only covers loss or damage of your property against "named perils" such as fire, vandalism, or theft. Read your policy carefully to determine exactly what is covered.  Travel insurance policies likely compensate you for lost or damaged baggage beyond the airline's maximum limits.If you travel often, you might consider getting a separate baggage policy that will cover all of your checked bags for a year. Some travel-oriented credit cards offer travel insurance as one of their perks. Check your credit card agreement to see if you have it and what the restrictions are. Keep in mind you typically must purchase your plane tickets on that card to use the coverage on your trip. Read your policy carefully and make sure you understand what it covers before you begin your trip. Report to your travel insurance carrier if the dates or cost of your trip changes to avoid having your claim denied., If you're traveling with something you can't live without or can't afford to replace, carry it on or arrange to ship it separately.   Keep in mind that valuable items such as computers, cameras, and jewelry typically don't fall under an airline's liability for loss or damage.Keep airline liability limits in mind as you pack your bags. If you start to go over the threshold, consider moving some items to a carry-on, checking two bags, or leaving some of the more expensive items at home.If you have little choice but to check a high-priced item, ask your airline if it provides additional baggage insurance. Some carriers allow you to purchase coverage for property that exceeds an airline's limits. For example, you can buy insurance from United for $1 per $100 insured, up to $5,000 in value. 

report loss or damage immediately.  get a file reference number and claim form.  provide details about your bag.  list essential items you had to purchase.  inventory the items you pack.  take photos of your packed bags.  keep receipts for any items you purchase on your trip.  understand the airline's liability limits.  check your homeowner's or renter's insurance policy.  purchase travel insurance.  don't check items that are fragile, expensive, or important. 

; ,,, Wait to add the grilling grid until you are ready to cook the food.  DO NOT GET LIGHTER FLUID ON YOUR SELF!! You have added enough lighter fluid when the charcoal briquettes are slightly shiny.  Using a long match or a long lighter, light the charcoal briquettes in the grill. You are ready for charcoal grilling when they are mostly covered in ash and glow red. In general, plan on it to take about 15 minutes for the charcoal briquettes to be hot enough for charcoal grilling.  Regardless of the type of food, the briquettes should spread out on the bottom of the grill slightly wider than the width of the food, to allow for even cooking. Use tongs or a spatula to spread the charcoal.   For thinner meat, spread the charcoal evenly on the bottom of the grill. For thicker meat, make the charcoal higher on one side than the other. You will start cooking the meat on the side with more charcoal. When the outside is cooked to your preference, finish cooking the meat on the side with less charcoal.  Using grilling gloves, carefully put the grilling grate in its place.  The exact steps to cook the food will depend on what you are cooking.

 Depending on what hemisphere you’re located in, the crescent moon will help you identify either south or north. The Northern Hemisphere is the portion of the earth that’s north of the equator, while the Southern Hemisphere is comprised of the area below the equator.All of North America and Europe are in the Northern Hemisphere. The northernmost portion of South America, two-thirds of Africa, and most of Asia are also in the Northern Hemisphere. Australia, Antarctica, the southern third of Africa, approximately 90 percent of South America, and some southern islands off the coast of Asia are in the Southern Hemisphere.  This method for finding your direction on only works if the moon is in either the waxing crescent or waning crescent phases, which occur approximately seven days in each calendar month. The crescent phases typically occur at the beginning and end of the month.If you’re not sure whether there will be a crescent moon on a given evening, there are a number of online calendars that provide the lunar phases for each month. Just do a search for “moon phases calendar” or “lunar phases calendar.”  , With your gaze fixed firmly on the moon, image a line from the two points of the crescent that tracks all the way down to the bottom of the skyline. If you are in the Northern Hemisphere, the point where the line meets the horizon is roughly south. In the Southern Hemisphere, the point where the line meets the horizon is roughly north.If you are having trouble following the imaginary line down to the horizon, it may help to hold a stick through the tips of the crescent moon as a guide.  

identify whether you’re in the northern or southern hemisphere.  locate the crescent moon.  draw an imaginary line from the moon’s “horns” to the horizon.

 There are a number of options for vegetarians and vegans when it comes to protein sources as well. Choose from some of the following options:   Tofu (8 grams of protein in three ounces) is probably one of the most well-known meat substitutes. Tofu is made of condensed soy milk and is an excellent source of nutrients, including all the essential amino acids our bodies need to function.Tempeh (16 grams of protein in three ounces) is a cake of partially cooked soybeans. It is a nutty, mushroom  plant protein that is still fairly unknown to most people.Seitan (36 grams of protein per half cup) is made from vital wheat gluten. It is often referred to as “the vegetarian wheat meat” because of its “meaty” texture., Chickpeas are low in calories, high in fiber, and a great source of protein, containing about 7.3 grams per half cup. They provide a nice crunch to your salad. (Try using them instead of croutons!), Adding nuts and seeds gives your salad a nice texture and some extra crunch. You have quite a variety to choose from as well:   Almonds (approximately 5 to 6 grams of protein per ounce) Chia seeds (4.7 grams of protein per ounce) Sunflower seeds (7.3 grams of protein per quarter cup) Sesame and poppy seeds (5.4 grams of protein per quarter cup), Beans are an often over-looked option for salads. However, adding beans can give your salad a heartier and more filling texture in addition to adding protein. Don’t be afraid to experiment with this flavorful option!   Black beans are somewhat sweet and go well with smoky flavors, like chipotle and bacon. Pair them with brightly-colored vegetables for a great salad.Kidney bean are best known for their use in chili, but they can also make a great addition to a spinach salad.White beans also work for salads. Try adding them to a Caprese salad for a unique dish.

 It can be easy to forget new assignments when trying to catch up on old ones. In addition to doing everything you missed while you were gone, make sure you complete anything new that's assigned the day you get back. This may mean you will have to make extra time for homework the day after returning to school.You may have to cut out certain activities if you get a lot of new work the day you get back. For example, you can sit out your softball practice one day to catch up on work. Write down any new assignments in your planner to make sure you keep track of everything.  It's important to take study breaks. If you're trying to do extra work, you'll burn out without giving yourself an occasional break. Every hour or so, commit to taking a five minute break. You can have a snack, text a friend, watch a video online, or do anything else that helps you unwind., Sleep is important to your well-being and ability to concentrate. If you missed school due to sickness, it's especially important not to neglect sleep upon returning. Strive for a solid night's sleep, even if you're struggling to catch up, so you have the energy to get work done in a timely fashion., Things like illness cannot be predicted. However, in some cases you may know you're going to miss class ahead of time. If you're missing class due to something like a vacation, ask for the work in advance. This way, you can complete the work before returning to school. 

do not neglect new assignments.  take breaks.  maintain your sleep schedule.  prepare beforehand whenever possible.

 She likes to regard herself as a “gangsta Nancy Sinatra” and “Lolita lost in the hood.” Aesthetically, this often means big eyes, a fair complexion, and a vintage look.Check out pictures of Nancy Sinatra as well as Lana Del Rey that focus on their faces. Look at their make up and see what features make it unique.  Create flawless looking skin to get your face ready for other products. Use a complementing primer, foundation, concealer, and powder to build a smooth, pale base that imitates Lana.   Always start by moisturizing your face and dabbing on a primer with a blending sponge. This will help the makeup last longer. Apply a light foundation using a foundation brush or blending sponge. Choose a shade lighter than your own skintone if you are not naturally pale. Do not try to change your skin tone all together, though. Simply opt for the palest version of your natural color. Use concealer on dark circles and imperfections. Blend out into the foundation with a small concealer brush. Use a fluffy brush to top your whole face with a translucent powder. Use a light hand and gently brush on a small amount of powder to set the look.  Lana regularly sports straight, dark eyebrows with little arch. Use a brow powder to darken and redefine the shape of your brows.   Choose a color no more than a shade darker than your hair’s root color. Too dark of a brow color could overwhelm the rest of the look.Use an eyebrow gel or powder and an angled brush. Start by defining the bottom line of your brow, keeping it straight at the arch. Once you have a baseline for the shape of your brow, fill in the area above it. Use small flicks of the brush in the same direction as your brow hairs to imitate the natural hair. Set with a clear brow gel to keep the natural hairs in place.  Lana is known for her big-eyed looks with simple shadows and large eyeliner wings. Create a softy, smokey eye look with bold black liner and oversized lashes.   Start with an eyeshadow that matches the color of your skin and apply all across your lids with a fluffy brush.Once your lids are neutral, take a cool gray or gray-brown shadow and buff it into your crease. Blend outward toward the tip of your brow, and concentrate the bulk of the shadow on the outer third of your crease. Take the same color used on the crease and apply it lightly along the lower lashline using a flat brush. Brighten your lids below the crease by patting on a pearl or satin-finish eyeshadow in a beige, peach, or nude shade. Use a flat brush, and concentrate most of the product on the center of your lid. Use a liquid black eyeliner to make a bold wing. Start by lining your lid using short strokes and connecting the dots in between each stroke. Then, draw on the wing by making a line that runs along the outer corner of your eye toward the thin tip of your eyebrow. Stop about halfway up the lid to the eyebrow. Connect the wing to the rest of your eyeliner by creating a triangle. Draw a straight line down from the tip of the wing down to the line you created on your eyelid. Then, fill in the triangle. Apply generous coats of black mascara to boost up your lashes on top and on the bottom. Apply a pair of false lashes along your upper lash line to get Lana’s exaggerated volume.  Lana doesn't often use an extreme contour, but she does shape her features slightly. Use a light hand to define your cheekbones and highlight the high points on your face.   Contour your cheeks with a contour powder or bronzer. Pick a color that looks tan on you, but not like a different skin tone.Apply the powder to the hollows of your cheeks and brush up toward your temples and into your hairline. Sculpt your forehead by bringing a slight amount of the contour color down from the sides of your head toward your ears. Strengthen your jawline by brushing the contour powder along your chin and jaw up to your ears. Blend down toward your neck. Highlight your cheekbones and nose bridge with a non-shimmering highlighter. Brush the highlight at the high points of your cheekbones and down your nose, as well as just under the brow bone. Use a cotton swab to place a very small amount of highlight just above your cupid’s bow. Use a light peach blush on your cheeks between the highlight and the contour. Lana wears peach and nude blushes instead of pinks and reds, so opt for something that doesn’t pop too much.  Pick a matte lipstick that best fits your look, and look at pictures for inspiration. Lana wears a variety of shades, including reds, soft pinks, nudes, and berries.   Line your lips with a neutral liner, or one that matches your lipstick color. Do not overdraw your lips. Instead, follow your natural lip line. Fill in your lips with the liner to help your lipstick last longer. Use your lipstick and a lip brush to apply color to your lips. Trace the edges of your lips with your lip brush before filling in the rest of your lip. Use concealer on a small brush to trace around the edges of your lip and create a sharp, defined line.  

learn about her look.  get a flawless base.  fill in your eyebrows.  get big, bright eyes.  sculpt your features.  shape your lips. 

 Skipping can also be cause by a worn chain, worn chainrings and worn sprockets.; , Disconnect the rear brake and undo the axle nuts.  The freewheel mechanism is contained inside the splined housing.  The process may vary for this step by manufacturer and hub design. Shimano freehubs are held on by a hollow hex bolt inside the housing itself. Remove the bearings on either side before undoing the bolt. , Check for any worn or broken parts, replace if necessary. The whole mechanism may need to be replaced if it is too worn or has other major damage. , If there is still skipping, check for other possible sources of the problem or get a new freehub body or even a new hub.  

make sure that the problem is caused by the freewheel.  remove the rear wheel.  remove the cassette.  remove the freehub assembly.  take apart the freewheel mechanism.  ,  clean and lubricate the whole mechanism.  put everything back together.  ,  test drive the bike to see if the fix was successful. 

 Moth eggs usually enter closest by way of clothing that has been worn outside.  Moths are attracted to wool, but they're especially apt to enter your closet if your clothing has stains from food and other items that they like to eat. Make sure you wash your clothes before hanging them up. Dry clean wool items before storing them.  Clothes you don't wear often, especially wool winter clothing, should be stored in an airtight place.   Protect wool coats and sweaters with plastic bags. Store winter clothing in plastic storage bags, plastic bins, or airtight metal containers.  Moths are attracted to humid spaces, so it's important to keep the air circulating and on the cool side so they don't decide to nest there.  Let your wool items get some sun, especially if you're taking them out at the beginning of fall or winter after they've been in storage.  Moths are repelled by cedar, so it's a good idea to hang wool items on cedar hangers.   You can also purchase ball-shaped pieces of cedar to hang in your closet, or fill a sachet bag with cedar chips and hang it up. Try placing cedar-scented items in the pockets of your wool items for extra protection.  Placing moth balls in your closet is an effective way to kill moths, but the chemicals moth balls are made with are toxic to humans, and they leave a strong scent in your closet and on your clothes. Try these alternatives:   Sachets made with dried rosemary, thyme, cloves, lavender, or bay leaves. Simply fill a small cloth bag with these ingredients, tie it with a string, and hang it up. Essential oils made from these herbs can be sprinkled in your closet or on your clothing as an effective moth deterrent.  Moth problems can usually be solved with these simple solutions, but if you find that moths keep returning, they may be laying eggs in a place you can't reach with a vacuum or sponge. Call a pest control professional to fumigate the area and kill the moth eggs.  

brush clothing made from wool, fur or feathers after you wear it.  keep your clothing clean.  store clothing properly.  keep your closet cool and well-ventilated.  air out your clothing often.  use cedar in your closet.  try moth balls or a natural alternative.  for extreme cases, call an exterminator. 

 If your suspect that your dog has mastitis, you should take your dog to the vet immediately. You should take your dog to the vet if the mammary glands show significant swelling and inflammation, or if the condition is preventing the puppies from getting the proper nutrition.Your vet will ask for a medical history and then conduct a physical exam of the dog.  One way to diagnose mastitis is to take samples from the swollen glands and analyze them. Your vet will take the samples and send them off to the lab. Your vet will probably start by getting a sample of the milk or pus from the glands and checking it for bacteria.Your vet may also want to to a sample of the firm mass collected in the breast area. To do this, they will insert a needle and remove a sample of the solid substance. Your vet may also take a culture to check for bacteria.  In some cases, mastitis can become severe and start infecting the blood. This can lead to serious side effects, including death. To check for this, your vet will need to perform additional tests. They may start with a blood count.The vet may also do a biochemical profile where they check the liver, kidney, pancreas, and sugar levels. They ay also do a blood count or a urinalysis.In some instances, the vet may do chest or abdominal x-rays.  

take your dog to the vet.  know what to expect from your visit.  allow the veterinarian to perform additional tests. 

 Think cute cropped-tops and shorts. Make sure that your clothes are always tasteful, though.; , For example, a flowy maxi skirt with a soft top and a belt.  Greens, purples, and almost EVERY shade of blue!  , If it doesn't work with your shape, Ariel still wears gowns that cinch in at the waist for a flattering figure.  Shell jewelry is fantastic. Also, sailor knots on a top or a rope belt can suggest the ocean as well.  This can be achieved with long, layered hair washed and towel-dried. Apply a wave-enhancing creme and let dry. Hair should be worn full and down, as if you had gotten back from the beach.  Take good care of your toenails and feet, just as Ariel would- they're too precious to mistreat!  , Wear concealer, top eyeliner, mascara, white eyeliner on your waterline and natural red lip color at most. In the nighttime, feel free to experiment with different looks and colors!  

when shopping, opt for cropped, fitted styles.  when ariel was on land, she had a classy style, so incorporate that kind of look in with your more summery pieces.  colors should be sea-inspired.  when choosing a formal dress, try out literally the "mermaid style" dress and see how it works for you.  nautical accents are strongly encouraged.  for hair, go for beachy waves.  wear sandals or other open toed shoes.  for daytime makeup, go natural. 

 These programs will reward you based on how much you play and can give you the opportunity to cash in for additional benefits. Compare the incentives of different casinos or sites, and choose the casino based on the benefits or freebies that are the best for you.   As a member, you may get additional offers in mail or online. During casinos' off-seasons, it's common for them to try to lure you in with free play, free food, or a free hotel stay (or all three).

If this is your first time, walk around and get to know the facility, especially if you are staying as a hotel guest. Generally, casinos are layed out with the action in the middle and the services around the perimeter. Notice where the rest rooms and emergency exits are located. Look at the floor and you will see the ugliest carpeting you have ever seen; that is there on purpose to keep you looking up, not down. But the floor will also show you where the main walkways are, should you become lost. Also notice the overhead signs that indicate different areas and how to get back to where you were.; , Though there are different types of machines all of varying, payouts, popularity, and method, how they work is generally all the same. There's just a few things you should know how to work:   You can pay with a previous payout ticket, your member card, or cash. Often (if not always), the previous payout ticket will go in the same slot the cash can be inserted. Most machines take $5, $10, $20, $50, $100 dollar bills, though some also take $1, too. These areas will be lit up and unmissable. If you see the Bill Acceptor not lit, or flashing blue, it is in need of service or what is called a Bill Drop . Press the HELP or SERVICE button to summon an attendant. Most machines no longer spit out coins. If you're looking for a coin tray, you may be looking for a while. New machines use the TITO system . Some casinos have reverted back to coin usage in the high limit areas, as it takes less time to play coins that it does to insert paper. But for machines of $500 denomination and higher, you will need a ticket to play. For certain variations of games, the methodology is spelled out on the glass above the screen. It'll tell you what type of game it is, what each spin pays out, and details on the jackpot. If it's there, read it before you sit down. Some machines will be blatantly better than others. Machines tend to be grouped by denomination, style and brand name. Video slots have a HELP or INFO button that will walk you through the various payouts, play lines, bonus games and special features. Each machine has a light on top of it called a 'candle'. The candle contains a color indicating its denomination, and also serves to notify the slot attendant if service is needed. The candle flashes in specific patterns for service needed, entry made into the machine, jackpot, door not secure, and other functions. Locate the "Cash Out" button. This is how you'll finally be freed from your semi-conscious state and released into the world of windows, clocks, and not-for-free soda. Press it and it'll tabulate your winnings and issue a ticket, which you can then take to the cashier or to the payout redemption machine -- if you win, of course. Keep in mind that tickets are bearer instruments; whoever holds it can redeem it. So guard it as you would cash. If you find one on the floor or other location, do NOT attempt to redeem it; turn it in to Security or other official. All tickets are numbered and time-stamped, and attempting to cash out one that isnt yours can get you in trouble, up to and including being ejected and barred from the location!  , With slot machines, you can bet a surprisingly high amount of money in no time. In fact, they can move faster than some table games. There are machines where you'll get by betting 50 cents and other machines that, in order to really be playing, you'll need to bet $5. Find an amount that doesn't make your stomach churn?   Generally speaking, if more money is needed to hit the jackpots, you should bet it (why play if you can't win?). So if you're not looking to dip into your grandmother's inheritance, the penny, nickel, or quarter slots may be more to your liking. And you'll get more playing time out of your dollar in the long run! Most casinos lay out these machines in sections. You'll see giant lit-up signs displaying "5¢" or "25¢" or "1¢." If the casino is a maze (as some seem to intentionally be), just grab a waitress or attendant to be pointed in the right direction. High limit slots, usually $5 and higher, are located in separate rooms or 'salons', with their own attendants and cashiers.  Sure, casinos employ a certain level of strategy in placing their slots, but each one varies and it's not something so simple as to be understood with a quick glance or paragraph. What's more, with technology nowadays, they can change a machine's payout at the click of the button. So before you go asking that cute hostess where you should play, think again.   While we're at it, the concept of a "hot" machine also doesn't pan out logically. Realistically speaking, a slot machine is a like a pair of dice. You may feel like after you roll four sixes in a row you're probably not going to get another six, but in all likelihood, the six is just as likely to come up again as every other number. With each roll, the dice starts back over. And the slot machine is the same. It's only over the course of an absolutely Titanic-sized number of turns that the casinos are getting their payout numbers.Unless you plan on making a career out of risking your money, there's no point in letting it factor into your decisions.  

join any "slot clubs" or "player perks" your casino offers.  know what you're looking at.  decide the amount that you're comfortable betting each pull.  don't buy into casino mapping.

 Early pregnancy tests can also be taken up to five days prior to your period, but results are not as accurate. Missing a period is usually considered a sign that you might be pregnant. Ovulation usually occurs about halfway between the start dates of two consecutive periods. Most women ovulate between 11 and 21 days into their menstrual cycle. During this fertile period, pregnancy can result from having unprotected intercourse or a failure in birth control methods. Usually a late or missed period is an indicator of pregnancy, though you can miss your period for other reasons (such as stress, hormonal changes, illness, etc.). When taken the day of your expected period, EPT pregnancy tests are 99% accurate.; , Using one of these tests too early can give a false negative result. This is because the test works by measuring the levels of a certain hormone (HcG) in your urine. This hormone is present only when the egg has been fertilized and it has become implanted in the lining of the uterus. HcG is present in your urine after conception, but at very low levels at first. If the test is taken too early, the hormone level might not have reached the level at which the test can detect a pregnancy. Try to avoid taking the test before the first day of your expected period if possible.  The time of day can make a difference when using a pregnancy test. Most pregnancy tests suggest that you use the test when you first urinate in the morning. This is because your urine is more concentrated in the morning and may contain more HcG. Doing this decreases the possibility of a false negative result that could occur later in the day. False negatives can occur if you drink a lot of fluid during the day and your urine becomes diluted.  There are two types of EPT Pregnancy Tests available. One uses simple lines to indicate pregnancy, while the other actually displays the word “pregnant” or “not pregnant.” Both have the same accuracy rating, so choosing between them is just a personal choice. While easier to read, the digital tests are more expensive. Each box usually contains two tests.  Each box contains two separate tests, so purchasing one box is sufficient for most women. It is important to be sure that the box is sealed and that there are no signs of damage that could lead to false test results You should also check the expiration date on the box to be sure that the pregnancy test has not been sitting on the store shelf too long and lost its ability to function properly. If your box is damaged or the tests are expired, purchase a new test.  When you are ready to take the EPT pregnancy test, open the box and remove one of the test sticks, which are wrapped separately. The wrapper should be removed from the test stick before use. Many women open the wrapper all the way and set it nearby so that they can place the used test on it while waiting for the results to appear. Otherwise, discard the wrapper.  The test will have a cap on one end. It should be removed after you are sitting on the toilet so that you do not need to lay the opened test stick down anywhere and risk contamination. Once you remove the cap, make sure you don't set the test stick down. If it becomes dirty, you may contaminate the test and get an incorrect result. Save the cap for later use. If you are going to show the test to a partner, you will want to re-cap it for sanitary reasons.  This end will absorb the urine. The end of the test stick that was under the cap needs to be held in your stream of urine for at least five seconds in order for the test to work properly. An alternative to holding the test stick in the stream of urine is to catch some of the urine in a disposable cup and hold the end of the test in the urine. Usually when a container of urine is used, the test stick needs to remain in the urine for about 20 seconds. If a cup is used, it is important to properly dispose of it.  Without touching the end that was in the urine to anything, you should lay the test stick down on the wrapper or a flat surface. The test stick is designed so that when it is placed flat, the testing end is not in contact with the surface. Placing the test stick on the wrapper can help you to prevent the absorbent end from touching anything. Alternatively, you can now place the cap back onto the test.  These next few moments may be nerve racking. Take a deep breath and try to relax. It can take two to ten minutes for the results to appear. Some women find it emotionally easier to set a timer and walk away from the test stick. When the results appear, you will need to interpret them. This is especially important if you use the non-digital test.  The words "Pregnant" or "Not Pregnant" will appear in the window.The results of this test usually appear within three minutes. The EPT tests with the results given in word form are easy to interpret, but are more expensive than standard line tests. While you wait for the results, an hourglass may appear in the window. The hourglass symbol will flash to show the test is working. When it stops flashing, your results should appear.  The tests that use the line indicator can be a bit more challenging to understand. For these, there are two small windows on the side of the test stick. The square one will show a single line within 10 minutes after taking the test. This line simply indicates that the test stick was properly used. The other window is round and it is the one that indicates if the test was positive or negative. If you are not pregnant, the round window will have a single line. If the test is positive and you are pregnant, it will show two lines that are crossed to form a plus sign. It is irrelevant if one line is darker than the other as long as the plus sign is visible.  It is important to remember that a negative test result could be false if the test was taken too early. If you want to confirm the negative result, wait a few days and then use the second test stick from the box. Instead of using the second test, you can also wait to see if you have your next period. If you re-test after missing a second period and get a negative result, contact your medical provider.  If there is nothing displayed in the test windows after 10 minutes, you should check the instructions in the box to make sure you did everything correctly. If you think that you did something incorrectly, you can use the second test from the box to take another test while following the instructions more closely. If there are no results with the second test, you should contact the company because the product may be faulty. If you experience this, you can call the company and they may send you another test.  Once you have found your results, put the cap back on the test so that anyone else who looks at the test stick will not come into contact with your urine.   The cap will not cover the results window. The results will remain in the window on the line test. The results on a digital test may disappear after a few days.  

take the test the day of your expected period for best results.  try to avoid taking the test too early.  take the test first thing in the morning.  choose which test you would like to use.  inspect the test and the box before using it.  unwrap the test.  remove the cap of the test once you are sitting on the toilet.  urinate on the end of the test stick that was under the cap.  lay the test stick down.  wait for the results to appear.  read the results of the test if it is the digital test.  assess the results of a test with lines.  remember that a negative test could be false.  troubleshoot if nothing appears in the test stick window.  place the cap back on the test. 

 Using any information you have available—such as plat maps, old survey deeds, etc.—you may be able to lay your own property lines using basic surveying techniques. Starting from any known corner, measure out the distances and angles listed on the survey deed or plat map. Without precise equipment and training in surveying techniques, however, the result will only be a very rough estimate of your property lines, unsuitable for laying fences, etc. If you want to get a crude idea of your property lines using this method, you will need to gather equipment including: A compass A calculator Whatever deeds, plat maps, etc. that you have available A tape measure or pacing count to measure distance  , If you want or need a precise verification of your property lines, a professionally-trained surveyor will have the equipment and knowledge for the task. Surveyors available in your area will be advertised in typical online and hardcopy business and contractor listings; your local county assessor or recorder’s office may also be able to recommend one to you.   Employing a surveyor is advisable if you are purchasing or selling land, building a fence or other structure on or near a suspected property line, if there is a land boundary dispute, or in any other situation where a precise determination of property lines is needed.Costs for surveying a property can vary widely depending on your location; a typical residential lot survey may cost several hundred dollars. Costs may go up if the property boundaries are unusual or difficult in some way. A surveyor should be able to give you a cost estimate before being hired. When hiring a surveyor, look for one that is licensed to work in your area.  After surveying your property, a surveyor will be able to provide you with documents including a certified drawing of the property, listing corners and occupation lines, the location of improvements (such as housing), etc.Since this information can be valuable in the future, you will want to keep all records received from the surveyor in a safe place, whether in digital or hard copy format (or both).   You may also need to (or want to) register the new survey with your county assessor or recorder. Contact your assessor’s or recorder’s office if you are thinking about having a professional survey of your property.  

use basic surveying techniques for a rough estimate of your property lines.  contact a professional surveyor for the most accurate determination of your property lines.  keep records of all surveying documents and information. 

 Before generating a list of game questions, you must first go through all of your study materials and review critical information. While reviewing, form questions and produce a list. , Once your list is created you are ready to craft several pieces of small paper. These pieces of paper will serve as the main game pieces.   Use card stock or heavy-duty paper for sturdy game pieces. Use sticky notes as another option to quickly create piece.  You created your main game pieces so now you must number them according to how many questions you developed. , Place all of your numbered game pieces into the container and be careful not to forget any. Be sure to shake the container once you’ve put all your game pieces inside to ensure the pieces are mixed sufficiently.  Keep your list of questions next to you as you pull pieces out of the container. Choose randomly from the container and read the number on the piece of paper. , Find the number on your question list that corresponds to the number on your game piece and read that question.  After answering each question, put the used game pieces aside so as not to repeat any.   If you are unable to recall the correct answers to any questions you can make two piles designating one for challenging questions and one for easy questions. When you play the game for again, you can just put the challenging questions inside the container and spend less time reviewing the questions you already know.  Continue draw the papers from the container until you’ve used them all.   To play again, simply fill up the container and start over.  

create a list of questions.  cut small pieces of paper.  number papers.  put papers in container.  draw paper from container.  answer corresponding questions.  set aside used pieces.  repeat steps until container is empty. 

 It's a yellow app sporting a white ghost.; , Do so by using the larger, round button in the bottom-center of the screen.   Tap the button for a photo Snap.

 You'll need to create several clues to the "finder" to alert them to the next place where they'll find the next clue.; , If you can, prepare yourself with several boxes (boxes that look like gifts work best) to hide each clue inside. You can also place the clue underneath safe Christmas decorations, tinsel, or something else. Only use stuff that is associated to Christmas, and plan out where each will go so that you can tackle the actual clue writing.  Think up several rhymes that will help guide your kids to their next intended location.   Use your imagination when thinking up ideas. The key is to keep your kids mind's thinking, yet still keeping them uninformed until the very end.  Make sure to disperse them into several rooms over long distances. If you have more than one floor, you can even have them chase up and down the stairs at times. Criss-cross the notes. If you can, have the clues hit into every room of your house.   Make sure you second-guess your own kid's intended route-markings, after you place the clues in their intended spots. Check to make sure the planned route you've set up for your kids can safely get them and you there, without crossing into a former location's answer. A light mark of a pencil can help make sure you haven't crossed into a previous location's clue a second time around. Clues that are in a room, can be placed in two different spots, but make sure they are easy to get access to.  This could probably be inside cabinets in the bathroom or inside a master bedroom, or wherever you decide it imperative for them not to look.  Either wrap up several gifts in a separate box, or if the gift is larger than one other gift box, have it in a place where you can be assured your kids can't accidentally notice the first time around and move it shortly before the scavenger hunt begins.  Enjoy the hunt, and get into the Christmas spirit!  

get out several sheets of paper and a colorful writing utensil.  plan out your clue locations.  write your clues.  spread the clues from all the clue-papers all around the house.  don't try to place your clues in spots where you don't want your children to be.  reveal the coveted surprise in the last room.  gather your children and let them try out your scavenger hunt. 

 You may want to save a new version of an existing document, while you learn to work with the paintbrush tool. Once you have mastered it, you will be ready to change colors, using all its features, on the final document.; , This will allow you to change the paintbrush work without changing the object itself.   You can create a new layer by clicking on the Window Menu on the top horizontal toolbar, and then clicking the "New Layer" button at the bottom of the box.  This is the box of options, listed vertically on the left side of the screen. Select the paintbrush tool by clicking on it, or clicking the letter "b" on your keyboard.  You want to make changes to your brushes and colors before you start to use the tool on your object. Scroll through the window to see your Adobe brush options, and select the size or style of brush you want by clicking on it.   You will see that some of your brush options choose the size of the brush that you can use for freehand drawing, while others are automatic brush strokes in a variety of styles. You can also download more of these pre-set brush strokes from Adobe's website or independent graphic design sites.  You should see 2 boxes with colors, with 1 solid and the other an outline. Click on the outline box to change your brush color in the color gradient box that pops up.   You do not need to set a color in the solid color box. This is a "fill" color, which is used to fill objects. In the case of brush strokes, you are drawing a line and nothing needs to be filled in.  Start to paint on it with your new color. Experiment with drawing using your tool brush, and select new brush strokes from the Brushes Window to see how they look on your object.   If you are working with geometrical objects, hold down the shift key as you use a brush stroke. This constrains your stroke to a 45, 90, 135 or 180 degree angle.  Open this box to gain access to your library of brush strokes. This includes "bristles," "artistic" strokes and "arrows," among other types of brushes.   Once you choose the type of brush that you want to use from the pop out menu, a box will pop up that shows you all of the types of brushes in that category.  Once you click on the stroke, you will see anchor points that allow you to resize the object. This is the advantage of using the paintbrush tool in a new layer, because you can change the brush stroke without changing the object.   You can also change the size of the brush stroke and the opacity of the object, by using the toolbar. This toolbar sits directly below the Menu toolbar on the top. Experiment with changing the brush stroke size and opacity when your stroke is selected.  The layers will be compressed on your final document. Once you have experimented with the paintbrush tool, begin to use it on professional documents.  

open an adobe illustrator document.  select the layer that you want to change in your layers window, or create a new layer on top of the object to place your brushes on.  find the paintbrush tool in your tools palette.  go to the windows menu and choose the "brushes" option, in order to bring up the brush window.  go to the bottom of your tools palette.  return to your object.  return to your brushes window and find the small box in the lower left hand corner.  change your brush stroke by selecting the stroke you have just made with your direct selection tool (black arrow) at the top of your tool bar.  create a new layer with each new brush stroke style you decide to use, so that you can change your strokes independently. 

 A rectangular solid, also known as a rectangular prism, is a three-dimensional shape with six sides that are all rectangles.In other words, a rectangular solid is simply a three-dimensional rectangle, or box shape.  A cube is really just a special rectangular solid in which the sides of all of the rectangles are equal.  The formula for the volume of a rectangular solid is Volume = length * width * height, or V = lwh.  The length is the longest side of the rectangular solid that is parallel to the ground or surface it is resting on. The length may be given in a diagram, or you may need to measure it with a ruler or tape measure.   Example: The length of this rectangular solid is 4 inches, so l = 4 in. Don't worry too much about which side is the length, which is the width, etc. As long as you end up with three different measurements, the math will come out the same regardless of how your arrange the terms.  The width of the rectangular solid is the measurement of the shorter side of the solid, parallel to the ground or surface the shape is resting on. Again, look for a label on the diagram indicating the width, or measure your shape with a ruler or tape measure.   Example: The width of this rectangular solid is 3 inches, so w = 3 in. If you are measuring the rectangular solid with a ruler or tape measure, remember to take and record all measurements in the same units. Don't measure one side in inches another in centimeters; all measurements must use the same unit!  , This height is the distance from the ground or surface the rectangular solid is resting on to the top of the rectangular solid. Locate the information in your diagram, or measure the height using a ruler or tape measure.   Example: The height of this rectangular solid is 6 inches, so h = 6 in.  Remember that V = lwh.  In our example, l = 4, w = 3, and h = 6. Therefore V = 4 * 3 * 6, or 72.  Since our example rectangle was measured in inches, the volume should be written as 72 cubic inches, or 72 in3.   If the measurements of our rectangular solid were: length = 2 cm, width = 4 cm, and height = 8 cm, the Volume would be 2 cm * 4 cm * 8 cm, or 64cm3.  

recognize a rectangular solid.  learn the formula for calculating the volume of a rectangular solid.  find the length of the rectangular solid.  find the width of the rectangular solid.  find the height of the rectangular solid.  plug the dimensions of the rectangular solid into the volume formula and calculate.  be sure to express your answer in cubic units. 

 At birth, a newborn’s skin may be reddish or pinkish.However, the baby’s hands and feet may be bluish (acrocyanosis) because blood and oxygen are not yet circulating fully to the extremities.As the newborn’s circulatory system opens, this bluish color will subside.   If your newborn’s skin is bluish all over (cyanosis), however, let your physician know right away.If your skin is dark, you can expect that your newborn’s will be lighter than yours at first.Newborns with fair skin may show some mottling, with blotches of reddish and whitish skin.; , There may be pink patches over a newborn's eye or in the middle of his or her forehead.These are called naevus simplex, commonly known as “angel kisses” or “salmon patches.” Usually, these fade within a few months, although they may be faintly visible afterwards.   Occasionally, a similar patch may be visible on the nape of a newborn’s neck. This is often called a “stork bite” and will also fade or become less noticeable in time.  Because birth can be a physically demanding experience for both mother and baby, a newborn may have some bruising. This may show as patches of blue or other colors on the baby’s skin at various places. This is not usually a cause for concern, however. Your physician will examine your newborn, including any bruising (if present), and make sure that he or she is ok.  At birth, a newborn’s skin may appear smooth and slightly puffy. There may also be noticeable swelling.Some amount of puffiness, especially on an infant's head or eyes (called edema) is not uncommon and will go away.However, let your physician know if you notice increased swelling after birth, especially in a particular area, such as the newborn’s feet or hands., 24-36 hours after birth, a newborn’s skin may still be pinkish, but it may also begin to look flaky.There may be some skin peeling (most common in the hands and feet); normally, it will go away without issue.   Your infant’s skin may still turn reddish when he or she cries, and turn slightly bluish or spotted if he or she becomes cold., A newborn’s skin may be covered in vernix caseosa, a white, cheesy substance. This may be present only at skin folds, such as on the legs.This protects the infant’s skin from amniotic fluid when in the womb, and will wash off during his or her first bath.Since the vernix caseosa washes away, you may not notice it for very long, if at all.  This is caused by the mother’s hormones that were passed to infant. The condition is harmless, and will clear on its own., Many infants will show “cradle cap” (Seborrheic dermatitis) at some point. The skin on top of the infant’s head will appear dry, flaky, and perhaps oily.Cradle cap is harmless and it will typically go away by the time an infant is one year old. You can care for cradle cap at home:Rub the skin of your baby’s head with baby oil, mineral oil, or petroleum jelly an hour before shampooing. This will help to loosen dry and dead skin flakes. Wet the baby’s scalp before shampooing, and brush gently with a soft-bristle brush. This well help to remove cradle cap scales. Wash and rinse your baby’s scalp, then gently dry it with a towel.  A newborn’s skin may be covered in fine body hair called lanugo. This most commonly shows on the shoulders, back, and sacral area (at the bottom of the spine).This is usually associated with premature infants, but can be present on any.Lanugo will disappear in the infant’s first few weeks of life.  Plugged pores in the skin of an infant (usually the nose, chin, and cheeks) are called milia.These spots may appear similar to small whiteheads; however, they should not be confused with common “baby acne.” Milia is a common condition, appearing in about 40% of newborns, and will disappear on its own.  These are purple-black or blue-black patches that may show up (often near the lower back) on infants of African-American or Asian descent.Mongolian spots are harmless and will disappear in time, typically within a year, though longer in some cases., This is a rash that may appear 1-2 days after a newborn’s birth. It looks like small yellowish spots surrounded by larger red patches. Though it may look alarming, Erythema toxicum is harmless.It should disappear within a week., This condition causes a newborn to be red on one side and pale on the other.It may occur when the newborn lies on his or her side, and it happens because the newborn’s circulatory and related systems are still developing.The coloring may develop suddenly, but usually goes away soon (within twenty minutes), after the infant is active or cries.   Harlequin coloring is most common within the first three weeks of a newborn’s life.  An infant’s bottom or genitals may become red and sore, causing discomfort and irritability. However, the condition can be easily treated at home. Usually, diaper rash will be avoided or disappear within twenty-four hours if:Diapers are changed frequently The infant’s skin is washed carefully A non-prescription diaper ointment is applied at diaper changes  , This condition, called jaundice, is common in infants and is not usually associated with a disease or problem. It may cause yellowing of the skin, or orange or greenish in some cases.It may show up 24 hours after birth and peak at about 72 hours. It appears because an infant builds up a substance called bilirubin, and can have a number of causes ranging from not getting enough breast milk to the newborn having an immature liver.Usually, jaundice will clear on its own within a few days, but frequent feeding (every 2-3 hours) and a phototherapy treatment are also be recommended:   Phototherapy treatments expose the infant to light, which helps to eliminate bilirubin. Your physician will explain what phototherapy to use, if one is deemed necessary.  Light tan spots (sometimes called café-au-lait spots) may appear at birth or develop in a child’s first few years.If many of these spots (or especially large ones) are present, your doctor will monitor your child, since they may be a sign of a condition called neurofibromatosis.  There may be moles present on your newborn, called congenital nevi.These can vary in size: they may be as small as a pea, or large enough to cover an entire limb. Your doctor will inspect and monitor nevi, since large ones have a greater risk of becoming skin cancer.  Port wine stains (large purple-red patches) are often harmless, but could be a symptom of an underlying issue such as Sturge-Weber syndrome or Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome., Fat necrosis is a movable lump underneath the surface that appears on some infants. Though fat necrosis is often benign and will go away on its own within a few weeks, your doctor will want to examine the lump to make sure that it is not related to another condition (such as renal disease or hypercalcemia)., If your newborn’s skin is bluish all over (cyanosis), let your physician know right away.This could indicate that your newborn’s blood is not circulating properly, or be a sign of a heart problem., 

note your newborn’s skin tone.  look for common color patches.  don’t be alarmed if there is some bruising.  watch for swelling.  expect some peeling and flaking.  look for a natural coating on the skin.  expect some “baby acne.” mild acne may develop in the first few weeks of an infant’s life.  care for “cradle cap,” if it appears.  be prepared for body hair.  watch for milia.  note any mongolian spots.  watch for erythema toxicum.  take note of harlequin coloring.  care for diaper rash.if a wet diaper is worn for a long time, or if urine and/or stool irritate the infant’s skin, diaper rash can result.  let your doctor know if your newborn’s skin is yellowish.  look for any light brown spots.  monitor any moles.  have your physician examine any large purplish blotches.  have your physician examine any lumps that appear on your infant’s skin.  keep an eye on your newborn’s skin color.  contact your physician if you have any concerns.if you feel that your baby is acting unusually, or if he or she develops unexplained skin conditions, talk to your physician, especially if you notice:  pain, swelling, or warmth in an area of your baby’s skin  red streaks extending from an area on his or her skin  pus  swollen lymph nodes  fever (38°c / 100.4°f or higher)  your baby is unusually fussy  

 For this style of kitchen island, you will need a desk or table which has two flat sides which act as the “legs”, similar to Ikea’s Malm desk. You can purchase a table like this from furniture stores or you can make one from two rectangles of sturdy wood, or thick plywood. They should be at least 2” thick.   The first rectangle will serve as the countertop and should be cut to the desired size. The second rectangle will be cut in half and used to form the legs of the table, shortened if they make the counter higher than desired.Join these together by cutting a 45° angle at the edge of both sides of the top and at one end of each of the two legs. You will then need to press these angles together, lining the inside of the joint with wood glue and screwing from the top of the legs into the center of the countertop at at least four points. Once completed, you can paint or laminate the main section of the island as desired.  Next, you will attach cabinets or organizers to the underside of the table in order to create interesting and usable space in your design. These will be chosen partially by the space (as the width of the island will determine the depth of any cabinets) and partially by your organizational needs.   You will need to be sure that they equal the length and width of the underside of the island. They also should be no taller than the underside. Use a pair of upper cabinets with organizational shelves sandwiched between them to maximize usability with your island. It will be best if the cabinets are double-sided, so that some items can be accessed regardless of where you are in your kitchen.  Attach these by screwing from the inside of the cabinets or shelves into whatever part of the main island they are touching, as well as each other if there is any wood thick enough.   Be sure to use only screws which go no further than halfway through the wood panel, as any further may split, warp, or puncture the outer surface.  You can paint the under-counter storage if you want, either the same color as the main island or a contrasting color. You can also add different countertops if you wish, by tiling the wood, adding butcher’s block or a granite slab.  

find or make the right type of desk or table.  find cabinets and organizers.  attach the cabinets to the desk.  add details and finishing touches. 

 It's fine to confess to having a bit of anxiety about dental work. Every dentist and orthodontist has encountered it before because it is a common anxiety. If you tell your orthodontist your fears, she can take steps to help put you at ease., If you have specific concern, it's fine to visit the office beforehand to talk to the orthodontist or staff ahead of time. Bring up your specific question, and ask how the orthodontist can address it.For instance, if you have a strong gag reflex, ask how the orthodontist can help.  If you are getting new braces, talk to your orthodontist about what's going to happen. Knowing each step can help put you at ease. 

tell the orthodontist you have anxiety.  discuss your specific concern.  ask the orthodontist to walk you through the procedure.

 You may think waiting until your child is old enough to enjoy nature is best, yet get them comfortable being outside and in nature from a young age. Allow a baby to crawl around in the grass, get them walking on trails once they’re comfortably able to walk, and expose them to nature and the outdoors as much as possible throughout their development. Make time in nature a normal part of life and not only for special occasions or certain activities.Some parents carry their children in a hiking backpack to allow their babies to tag along on hikes before they can walk.; , Allow them to experience nature and the outdoors on their own terms. Give them time in nature away from playgrounds for them to approach it how they like. Let them explore their surroundings on their own terms and use their imaginations on how to interact with it. With their imagination, they might turn overgrown weeds into a jungle, rocks into lava, or a log into a balance beam.Experiencing nature on their own terms and in their own way can help kids appreciate nature in a way that’s meaningful to them.  Nature provides lots of opportunities to use the senses. Have kids smell the flowers, taste local berries, listen to the birds sing, touch different textures of leaves and bark, and see beautiful sights around them. Get kids involved with nature by letting them explore on a multi-sensory level.Best of all, nature “equipment” is free. Get kids to climb on boulders, balance on logs, splash in lakes, and explore streams.Give children opportunities to use their senses and encourage them to use as many as they can!  , In the USA, the National Parks have a Junior Rangers program which inspires children to explore, learn, and protect the outdoors. Kids can become Junior Rangers by participating in activities and taking an oath to protect and share the parks with others. While this program is largely through the national parks, national monuments also participate in kid-friendly programs that are largely available throughout the USA.Visit national parks and lands near you or plan a vacation to visit national sites.  Put a towel down or hang a swing in your backyard for your kids to enjoy activities outside. They can bring a book outside to read, play board games on the grass, have a picnic, bring their figurines to play under a tree, or paint. Bring your own activities outside as well and lead by example.Have your kids do their homework outside or do crafts outside.  If you have space, plant a few plants and vegetables for your children to tend to and watch grow. Children will be excited about the growth of their plants and learn when plants are ready to be eaten. Children can learn to associate their garden with growth and food and make connections about plants and food.Choose some plants, flowers, and herbs and have your children plant them with you. Some plants grow easily such as baby tomatoes and pea plants.  Encourage children to look at clouds and learn about them. Talk about the different things you see in clouds and what they might be. At night, encourage children to look at the stars. Identify constellations and watch meteor showers, eclipses, and other events. Enjoy sunsets and sunrises and remind children that nature exists above them, too.Have contests for who can find the moon or identify what phase it is in.  Children are naturally curious, so direct their curiosity to explore rivers, ponds, hikes, leaves, logs, and blooming flowers. Plant some flowers and speculate as to what color they might come up. Watch a bird fly and discuss where it might be going. Get them curious to their surroundings and what’s happening to the birds, plants, trees, and other animals.No matter what your children’s ages, they can experience the magic of frogs croaking or crickets chirping.  If the weather in uncooperative yet you still want to engage with nature, grab some books and read with your kids. There are plenty of books about nature, plants, and animals. Read informative books about your local geographical area or read fiction books about children who enjoy the outdoors. Even if nature is not easily accessible, you can still inspire your child and help them learn about nature.For older kids, read “The Jungle Book” or “The Island of the Blue Dolphins.” To younger children, read “Little Cloud,”“The Giving Tree,” and “The Curious Garden.” Keep field guides and outdoor adventure books in your home to inspire trips to national parks and other special places.  Nature doesn’t have to exist only outside. Have your children pick up acorns, leaves, shells, and other items to decorate the home. Kids will enjoy collecting the items and putting them on display. Adding to the collection can become a family activity.For example, each child can choose one leaf to dry and press each autumn. Then, frame the leaves and put them in their bedrooms.  Kids don’t realize how trees help with the air or how we rely on rain to water the plants so they have food to eat. Talk about how nature is necessary for everyone to survive, whether it be creating the conditions for plants to grow so people can eat or for creating materials to wear as clothes. Even though most food is bought at a grocery store, explain to your kids where their fruits and vegetables come from and how nature plays a part in growing them.Telling children how nature is a part of their everyday lives can help them realize how important is it to protect nature and appreciate it.  Make as many positive associations with being outside in nature as possible. If a kid has a meltdown on a hike, have things available for their recovery so that they can turn it around and keep going. Control your own frustrations and help them cope with their ordeals.Bring along their favorite snack to eat or a comforting teddy bear if they start to feel tired or cranky. Take lots of breaks and make the breaks enjoyable by playing a game or taking silly photos.  Kids get tired, exhausted, hungry, and thirsty a lot quicker than adults. If you’re planning an all-day outing at the park, a hike, or a camping trip, come prepared. Take some baby steps in preparing them for a trip by starting with one night of camping before going on a weekend camping trip. If kids start to whine or get cranky, pull out their snacks or take a break.For example, hiking a steep climb may be too much for a child who hasn’t done much hiking, and may affect their opinion of spending time in nature. Take steps slowly so your child grows to love the outdoors, not resent them.  Choose an activity that’s easy to accomplish yet still feels special. For example, take a family walk outside on each full moon. Being out after dark can be exciting for kids and something to look forward to doing together. You can read a bedtime story outside, collect one stone or shell from each trip to the beach, or press a leaf each time you go on a hike.Have something easy to look forward to, such as having activities on the full moon or the first day of the month.  

start young.  give them unstructured time outside.  get them connected with their senses.  enroll them in outdoor programs.  take indoor activities outside.  plant a small garden.  look up.  heighten their curiosity.  read together.  fill your home with nature.  emphasize the connection between people and nature.  create positive associations.  don’t push too hard.  create family traditions around nature. 

 Think carefully about the size that you want. If you like to include a lot of details, you’ll probably need a larger notebook. But something smaller will be easier to carry, and it will take up less room in your backpack.   You’ll also have a choice of bindings. Spiral-bound notebooks lie flat, but composition books and similar notebooks with a sewn binding won’t damage your other books and papers, as spiral bindings sometimes do.If you like to keep all of your papers together, consider purchasing a notebook that has a folder attached or a pocket inside the front cover. If you choose to draw a biweekly calendar rather than listing your assignments, you may find that blank, grid-lined, or grid-dotted paper is a good choice.; , Also include any information that would help someone return your planner if you lose it. This includes your grade level, phone number, and/or student ID number.  This way, you’ll have it available for easy reference.  Do you like stickers, or are you more of a doodler? Do you hoard pictures and fun text from magazines and love to create collages from interesting materials?Do you like making daisies with White-Out and highlighters?   If you like comics, consider drawing a comic strip or your favorite superhero on the cover.Make sure that whatever you use will be durable. For example, if you glue sequins to the cover or use glitter, you risk losing your decorations in the deep, dark bottom of your backpack.  Once you have a plan, make a list of everything you need. Paints, markers, glue, colored pencils: gather it all together and set yourself up wherever you like to work when you’re creating things.  Decorating the outside is one of the best ways to make your planner just for you. And the more you feel like your planner expresses your personality and creativity, the more you’ll want to use it. Plus, you’ll get to show off your beautiful work!  , Lay the notebook flat so that you can see both the reverse side of the first page on the left and the front side of the second page on the right.  The sections can be vertical columns or horizontal rows, depending on what you’re more comfortable with.   Adjust the number of sections per page according to the size of your pages and how many assignments you have. Lay it out in a way that makes sense to you. The point is to set up so that you'll find it easy to use and will consult it daily. A planner that you don't like using obviously won't help you organize your homework and get assignments done.  For example, Monday, March 3; Tuesday, March 4; and Wednesday, March 5. This is where you will record your homework assignments from that day.   If you structure the sections horizontally, you can use the margin or make a column on the right side to keep track of when your assignments are due.  You can divide it up into days like you did on the right side, or you can just list everything in the order that it will occur.   You can add other sections to this page if there is anything else you need to keep track of. The more information you write down, the more you’ll use your planner as a reference. And if you’re using your planner regularly, you’ll be less likely to forget an important assignment.  Turn it so that it is horizontal in front of you.  Use a ruler if you like neat, precise lines. Make each square large enough to record your assignments.   If you are using a smaller notebook, you may only be able to comfortably fit one row. That’s perfectly fine. It’s better to have only one week on the page than to make the boxes so small that you can’t fit all the information you need.  Start with “Monday” above the first column, “Tuesday” above the second, and so on through Friday. The sixth and final column is for the weekend, so you can write either “Weekend” or “Saturday/Sunday.”  , For example, Monday, February 3rd to Sunday, February 16th.  Rotate it so that it is vertical again.  However, you may find that your assignments fill the available space.  You can make a page of goals for the next few weeks or the semester, a page for the school calendar, and a page with contact information and birthdays.  It will be easier to use your planner if you can flip straight to the section you need.  Make sure to write your assignments down every day. If you don’t have an assignment, make a note of it so that you’ll know later that you didn’t just forget to write it down.  

find or purchase a notebook.  write your name inside the front cover.  write or staple a copy of your class schedule on the first page.  think about how you want to decorate the outside.  collect your materials.  go for it!,  open to the second page.  divide the right page into three sections.  label each section with the day of the week and the date.  title the left page "after school" or “upcoming events.” this side is where you keep track of extracurricular activities, like band practice, sporting events, and dance class.  open your notebook to the second page.  draw a table with two rows and six columns.  label each column with a day of the week.  write the date range above the calendar.  lay your notebook flat so that you can see both pages.  title the left page “upcoming events.” if you have enough space on your calendar, you could also just write your extracurricular activities there.  add useful sections in the back of the notebook.  use sticky tabs or flags to label the sections.  write in your assignments.

 Often, you can look at Amtrak to locate stations.; , Because Amtrak does not travel at 450 mph (720 km/h), like airlines, it may take a few days to get where you are going. Make sure to take this into consideration.  Tickets can be purchased 3 ways: through Amtrak, by calling Amtrak directly (1-800-USA-RAIL, 1-800-872-7245), or at the station from an agent. Not all stations are fully staffed, however, so an agent may not be an option in your area. Also, it is recommended to purchase your tickets at least 3 days in advance to assure availability. Amtrak's popularity is on the upswing, and some trains sell out quickly.  If you are going on a longer trip, you may want to pack an extra bag that has some clothes in it for while you are on the train. In the western US, most trains have cars called Superliners that have 2 levels. They have restrooms downstairs; there are showers onboard, but they are only for passengers who book a sleeper room. If you booked a sleeper car room, you will have a small room to yourself. Plan to be on the train up to 4 days on longer trips (i.e. Chicago to San Francisco, Seattle to L.A., or Seattle to Chicago). Wear comfortable clothing. A t-shirt, jeans, and sneakers would suffice, but something a little nicer never hurts, especially in the evenings or at dinnertime. You may not be trying to win a fashion show, but a little goes a long way. A button-down or polo shirt combined with jeans or slacks would be a perfect match for staying comfortable without looking like you just rolled out of bed.  Arrive at the station at least 30 minutes before your scheduled departure. Trains can be several hours late, or a few minutes early. You don't want to arrive at the station with 3 minutes to spare and have to rush to the platform in time to see your train pulling off into the distance. If your station of origin (and destination) offers baggage service, you can check baggage, like an airline. Not all stations offer this feature, however, and BOTH your origin and destination city need to offer baggage handling for you to check bags.  Methods of getting on the train can vary greatly from station to station. At some stations, the conductor will scan your e-ticket before you board the train. At others, you get on the train and the conductor will scan your e-ticket onboard. The conductor will also give you a slip of paper called a seat check that has the number of people in your party, your destination, and your seat assignment on it. You must have the seat check in the slot above your seat at all times, otherwise your seat might be reassigned.  People that ride Amtrak trains are often the most friendly, casual, and laid back people in America. It is not hard to strike up conversations with random strangers, but don't be rude and persistent either. If somebody just wants to watch the scenery go by, let him be.  Trains are usually at a stop for about 2 minutes. Be ready to disembark from the train as quickly and safely as you can. The conductor will announce several minutes prior to a stop, which car the doors will be open at, and what the stop is. Make sure not to leave anything behind.  Think of all the manpower that went into your trip, from the Conductor, Engineer, and Dispatcher to the ticket agents, station agents, car cleaners, and maintenance personnel that make Amtrak possible.  Amtrak is only made possible by government subsidies that keep it running. Plan your next trip, because YOU vote for Amtrak with your wallet! If you use Amtrak and get your friends and your friend's friends, Amtrak will continue!  

find out where the nearest amtrak stations are to your home and your destination.  plan your trip.  purchase your tickets.  pack for your trip.  get to the station.  board your train.  enjoy your ride.  watch for your stop.  stand to the side and watch the gleaming animal that is/was your train pull quickly away.  write to your congressman/woman and urge them to continue to support amtrak. 

 Checking the zoo's homepage before you pick a day for your trip will keep you updated on the daily schedules and any special events you could see if you visit on specific days. Make sure these are included in the price of admission or be prepared to pay extra.; , Many animals will be most active in the morning right when the zoo opens and after feeding. Zoos will also receive new animals from time to time, so keep an eye out for new arrivals.   Take into account the weather. Some animals, such as elephants, might be more active after the rain. Take into account the time of year. Animals from warmer climates may not be able to tolerate the cold weather, and are placed inside for the winter. If you want to avoid large crowds don’t plan your trip on a major holiday. Instead plan to go on a weekday if you can. Try to see popular animals or exhibits early in the day, such as pandas, which almost always draw a line. , Plan your trip around the animals that your kids want to see. Do some research on their favorite animals. It will make the experience more memorable and also educational.   Checking out a book about your child’s favorite animal can excite them about the zoo trip while also reinforcing the experience afterwards. Respect your child’s sensitivities and avoid animals that they might be afraid of. For example, if your child doesn’t like snakes, be sure to stay away from the reptile house.  Based on your research and talking with your kids, list all the animals, exhibits, or events that you want to see, keeping in mind the timing of special events such as demonstrations, shows, or feedings.  Find a map of the zoo, either online, in a free zoo app, or from a kiosk once you get there. To avoid backtracking, plan the best route to take so you don’t miss any of the sites.  Most zoos have play zones for kids. Mark these on your map to let the kids blow off some steam.  Don’t forget to allot time for lunch. If you’re planning on buying lunch, find cafes or restaurants that your kids would enjoy. If you’re looking to save money, find a picnic area or even a bench to stop, rest, and eat a sack lunch.  If your children are hands-on, be sure to include a stop to the petting zoo on your route. Most zoos have a small area dedicated for this. Looking at animals all day that they can’t touch can be unbearable for some kids, so this can provide much needed some relief.  If it is a long trip, plan accordingly by giving the kids something to keep them occupied.   If you have a smartphone, you could download some mobile apps games or fun math games for kids to keep them from getting bored. Play some music they enjoy or a few interesting books or keep them engaged with fun road trip games like “How Many Trucks Do You See?” You definitely don't want a bunch of grumpy kids on your hands before the outing has even begun.  If you plan to bring a baby, don't forget to bring plenty of diapers, baby food, pacifiers, and extra clothing.  If possible, bring a wagon or stroller if your kids are too young to walk long distances or if they tire easily. Otherwise, you might find yourself having to carry them!  , It’s important to carry plenty of water, especially in warmer months. Bring a water bottle you can refill once you're there. The zoo will probably sell bottled water, but this can quickly get expensive.  Most of the zoo will be outside, so be sure to wear sunscreen and bring extra to use once you’re there.  Check the weather before you go, and bring an umbrella if it looks like rain. If you’re not wanting to carry around an umbrella all day, you can also pack plastic ponchos.  To make the most of your ticket price, get to the zoo when it opens and plan to be there all day. Getting there early will also help you see the animals when they’re most active and beat the lines for the popular exhibits.  The zoo might have a cafe but it's probably too expensive and the queues too long so it's a good idea to pack a lunch from home and get the kids to help out.   Don’t bring messy food. Chocolate is a definite no-no; fresh fruit, pretzels and sandwiches are your best bet since they are non-messy and will keep in a small cooler. Try to pack some snacks for mid-morning and early evening hunger pangs.  Many cities have a reciprocal agreement with the aquarium, other attractions, or even nearby hotels. If you are visiting a city and plan to see other major attractions check if there is a “city pass” or something similar. Some zoos will even have particular days or months when kids get in free with a paying adult. , If you plan to go to the zoo often, it might be worth buying a membership. These typically come out cheaper than buying individual tickets every time you go to the zoo. Zoo memberships also often have reciprocal deals with a city’s aquarium, so you could get access to both venues.  

check the zoo website for a schedule of events.  find the best time to go to the zoo.  ask your kids to help you plan.  create a list of sites you want to see.  map out your path through the zoo.  locate play zones.  locate restaurants or picnic tables.  locate the petting zoo.  find the best directions to the zoo.  bring baby essentials.  bring a stroller or wagon.  pack water.  pack sunscreen.  bring an umbrella in case of rain.  get there early.  pack a lunch.  search for money-saving deals.  consider buying a zoo membership. 

; , The game with either say "Score Twenty." or "Score Nineteen." The number will vary. Foreign versions will have different numbers.   You are now in action testing mode. You can press any of the three controls and it will make a sound. You can also blow or speak into the microphone to make Shout It work.  You will hear Buddy Rubino say "Master." Depending on the pitch of the device, lower pitched units will take a minute to beep and higher pitched units will take up to 30 seconds.  Then, the game will enter rapid fire mode. It will play every sound from the game.  Once the sound test mode is done, the device will return back to game mode. Pull the game to start playing.  

press the reset button and hold pull it and bop it.  let go of the reset button.  press the levels button.  wait, and you'll hear five beeps.  wait for the return to normal. 

 Upload or scan it into a computer and use imaging software to change it from colour to black and white. (If you have Photoshop, convert to black and white then save as a 4 color gif, which will provide a "posterized" effect.) Adjust the brightness and contrast until you have three distinct tones. If the picture turns out too complex at this point, find or take a simpler one for your personal skill level.; , After doing this, put a piece of strong cardboard of the same size behind the paper and tape the image onto it, so that the chocolate doesn't flop and slide everywhere later.  The best way to do this is by using a double boiler. A small pan containing the chocolate is placed in a larger pan with boiling water, and the chocolate is stirred constantly until it melts. Putting it in the microwave doesn't give the chocolate the nice smooth texture that you'll need to make the portrait. A double boiler with dark chocolate is shown for demonstration purposes.  Once the white chocolate has been painted, place the portrait in the fridge to cool and harden. , To avoid touching, melting or breaking the chocolate, place a piece of cardboard on top of the portrait. (You should now have the portrait sandwiched between two pieces of cardboard.) Hold the cardboard together firmly at the edges and flip the portrait. Detach the cardboard from behind the portrait and peel off the greaseproof paper. Place the piece of cardboard back on, flip the whole thing right side up again, and there you have it, a custom chocolate portrait!  

find or take a photograph of the face you wish to make a portrait of.  trace the image on grease proof paper (such as wax paper), outlining each of the three colours.  melt the white chocolate.  pour the melted chocolate in a piping bag and start working on the lightest colour of the portrait, using the outlines you drew as a guide.  repeat the previous two steps with the milk and dark chocolate until you have filled in all of the page.  ,  turn the picture upside down. 

 There are some who postulate that the Universe is as old as time itself. Time and space are inextricably linked and matter and energy occupy the fabric of space-time.  The Planet Earth rotates once each day (i.e., once every twenty-four hours), and the inhabitants spend approximately twelve hours in substantial darkness when half of the planet is hidden from the Sun, and twelve hours in substantial light when half of the planet is exposed to the Sun.        The excessively hot core of the Planet Earth is enveloped by a viscous layer known as the mantle which is in turn enveloped by the hard crust. Also, the Planet Earth is orbited by the Moon, and it (along with the Moon and other uninhabited planets) orbits the Sun (i.e. one of many stars) in one of many galaxies.       The Moon encircles the Earth once every twenty-eight days whereas the Earth and the Moon encircle the Sun once every three hundred and sixty-five days and a quarter of a day. The eight major planets orbiting the Sun are categorized as: the inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, and the outer planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Saturn is a ringed planet located in sixth place from the Sun and its ball and ring may be viewed as symbolic of acceptance and fulfillment.       There are approximately thirty days in a month and there are twelve months in a year. The four seasons of the year are winter, spring, summer and autumn. The winter months are the coldest whereas the summer months are the hottest. The seven identified colors of a rainbow are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet and a prism can separate white light into these colors. A rainbow is a natural example of how unity may coexist with diversity.       Existence may be divided into living things and non-living things. The Planet Earth is a beautiful habitat for plants, animals and people. The Planet Earth features mountains, valleys, plains, volcanoes and basins occupied by water.       The heat from the Sun causes water to evaporate into the air, which cools to form clouds, and this water falls to the Planet Earth from clouds as rain. Gravity exerts somewhat of a depressive force on objects, attracting materials towards the core of the Earth, and it also exists around and between objects, and keeps celestial bodies in their respective motions. Plants consume energy from the Sun, and internalize water and nutrients from the ground. Plants also grow towards the Sun or a source of light.       Celestial sights and sounds that appear and perform from time to time are lightning that dances and thunder that sings with suspected fury. Natural disasters which pose a threat to life and property include earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, tornadoes and wild fires. Air, water, food, and sleep are necessary for the survival of each individual human being and heterosexual reproductive activity is necessary for the survival of the species.       Herbivores are animals which consume plants exclusively, carnivores are animals which consume animals exclusively, and omnivores are animals which have the capacity to consume plants and animals. Human beings are omnivores and are situated at the top of the food chain. Plants are constrained by their attachment to the Planet Earth whereas the mobile capabilities of biological entities range from the ability to swim in water, to moving around on land and flying in the air. The Sun is a spherical gaseous object which emits immense quantities of light, whereas the Moon is a rocky spherical object, with a reflective surface, which houses and empties itself of the light from the Sun. The Moon waxes full and wanes empty which entails phases ranging from non-existent to partial to peak brilliance and the full moon is the phase of the Moon which entails the maximum reflection of light.      ; , The body is a vehicle, which houses the vehicle of the brain, whereas the will occupies the brain, and is the driver of both vehicles.  Homo sapiens are regarded as the crown jewel on the biological horizon in a manner reminiscent to the way in which: the great white shark is deemed the chief predator of the seas, the lion is regarded as the king of the jungle and the eagle is christened as the presidential navigator of the air.       Governments serve as the parents and leaders of the citizens of a nation and there is a concomitant duty to establish and preserve order in society through laws and law enforcement agencies which operate to protect life, dignity and property and to promote stability and upward mobility. The brain governs the body in a manner somewhat analogous to the way the laws of nature govern the cosmos. Human beings belong to the most advanced category of organisms in terms of the possession of a holistic awareness of the existence of all of space and all of time and the ability to communicate with respect to the content of such an awareness.       Words are thought packages which can be used to convey ideas, feelings, instructions and questions from one mind to another. The will is the decision-making aspect of a person which flies freely when a person is awake, and voluntarily initiates those activities of the brain and the body which are not reflexive. The will translates events from the personal mental universe of dreams to the common physical universe of destiny. At an advanced stage of emotional development the fate of the brain and body are hijacked from the hands of the emotions into the hand of the conscious decision-maker.       In the reproductive process, the mature female person houses the unborn human being for approximately nine months and endures the suffering as the body of the young person separates from her body during childbirth. A person’s skull is permanently united with his or her ribcage at the top of his or her body whereas the skull of an infant separates from his or her mother’s pelvis during childbirth. An umbilical cord connects an unborn human being to his or her mother and this is the structure through which nutrition is obtained prior to delivery.       This attachment is severed subsequent to delivery and forms an obsolete mouth of the pelvis (i.e. the navel) and the child proceeds to obtain nourishment from the breasts on the ribcage of his or her mother. Therefore, the pelvis may be viewed as a house of separation, liberation and hunger whereas the ribcage may be viewed as a house of togetherness, captivity and generosity. For generations, human beings have celebrated existence, life, and love with the artistic display and enjoyment of delightful food, engaging music, and rhythmic dancing.       Birth ceremonies, marriage ceremonies, and death ceremonies signify the three most momentous events of a person’s life. Death is symbolic of separation, marriage is symbolic of union and birth is symbolic of growth. Plants are constrained by their attachment to the Planet Earth similar to the way in which a person’s skull is attached to his or her ribcage.       Animals are free to move around similar to the way in which the attachment between an infant and his or her mother is severed. People are free to fly due to the human capacity to formulate instructions with the inner and outer voice. There is also a steady inhalation and exhalation mechanism which involves the automatic and possibly free pulling inward and pushing outward of air from a person’s head.       There is a natural mental signal to exclusively pursue pleasant sensations and to avoid all unpleasant sensations. Concomitantly, laughter is the expression associated with feeling high and tears are the expression associated with feeling low. Pleasure is usually a means to an end but in human beings the pursuit and enjoyment of pleasure and elevation may constitute an end in and of itself. The Universe has certain natural quality benchmarks to be met in the sense that organisms must qualify to survive and reproduce.       There is a natural predisposition to reject the members of a species perceived as inferior and to accept the members of a species perceived as superior. Love is the act of recognizing and maximizing the inherent value of an entity. Love is generally regarded as the most uplifting and magical emotion that a person can experience. Love is typically expressed by way of carefully observing a person, maintaining physical closeness, exchanging passionate words, arduous actions and meaningful gifts. If a person’s natural inertia, or reluctance to work, is not regulated, then it may result in wasted time, un-utilised energy and a lower standard of living for him or her.       Each person has the capacity to assess what is possible at a given moment, and to personally decide upon a course of action or inaction or upon a choice of words or silence from among his or her options. A person’s internal nature emotionally rewards personally constructive behavior and emotionally punishes personally destructive behavior. Each human being has a name, or a group of symbols, which are representative of him or her. Each person also has an innate ambition for his or her name, as well as for himself or herself to be held in the highest possible esteem.  Human beings have a natural desire to be sophisticated and impressive physically and mentally and there is also an innate desire to appear and perform more impressively than others of the same gender.  Relationships tend to be the most fulfilling aspect of life and the play of being hungry for each other should be balanced with the work of being happy to help each other survive and thrive. Romantic relationships are characterized by an intense physical, mental, and emotional connection between two people as each endeavors to solicit and retain the full attention of the other. With regard to competing for a romantic partner, it is quite obvious that if another person is more attractive than a particular person, then there is a greater chance of this particular person being ignored by some potential romantic partner due to the presence of the more attractive person.       The five standard senses used for an evaluation of things in the physical realm are seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, and tasting. The eyes feature the unity of love and the ears feature the separation of fear. The nose protrudes as a mountain on display and the mouth is a receptive basin. The skin captures the oneness of existence. Sights and sounds have a duplicating feature which allows them to be recorded. There are pleasant and unpleasant sensations which may be experienced with each sense organ. Artificial ornaments which have been utilized in the protection and advertisement of the human body and his or her status of wealth include clothing, jewelry, houses and cars, whereas natural ornaments include a person’s skin, hair, teeth and nails.       The skull of a human being is conferred with the prestige of an elaborate mane. Hair is coveted as decoration for the face, and the eyes are also completely encircled with hair referred to as eye lashes which are in turn partially encircled with hair referred to as eye brows. Strands of hair emanate from the skull in a similar manner to the way in which rays of light emanate from the Sun and the brows of the eyes regally spread across the forehead like the wings of a bird in flight. The colors and textures of eyes, skin, and hair, range from dark to light.       The texture of skin and hair ranges from hard to soft. Exposure to the Sun darkens the complexion of the skin whereas the lack of exposure to the Sun lightens the complexion of the skin. Hair and nails are rooted in the body but are dead materials which continue to grow as long as a person is alive and may be cut without the sensation of pain. The skull may be viewed as a house of knowledge, the ribcage as a house of strength, and the pelvis as a house of beauty. It has been observed that males tend to have greater capacity with regard to physical strength whereas females tend to have greater capacity with regard to physical beauty.       The capacity to acquire knowledge is more or less balanced between genders and there is an innate capacity to interpret situations that is called intuition. The skull and spine of human beings assume more of an upright posture, and it is apparent that the average height of males exceeds the average height of females.       Health and fitness are universally appealing and men tend to flaunt muscles whereas women tend to flaunt curves. A skull has a more or less standard structure, however, the ribcage and pelvis of a person may be structured as a pear, hourglass, ruler or an apple. A pear is structured with a narrow ribcage and a wide pelvis, and depicts a love in tandem with fear relationship. An hourglass is structured with a wide ribcage and a wide pelvis separated by a slender waist and depicts a fear in tandem with fear relationship. A ruler is structured with a narrow ribcage and a narrow pelvis and depicts a love in tandem with love relationship. An apple is structured with a wide ribcage and a narrow pelvis and depicts a fear in tandem with love relationship. The spine is rooted in the pelvis, the ribcage is attached to the middle of the spine, and the entire spinal column supports the skull. Two limbs are attached to the ribcage and two limbs are attached to the pelvis. The upper limbs (i.e. the arms) culminate with two hands, each having five fingers, and the lower limbs (i.e. the legs) culminate with two feet, each having five toes. The legs are united whereas the arms are separate. The 2 legs, the 2 arms, and the 1 spinal column amount to 5 which may be segmented as 3 groups in this instance.       The tripartite structure of the human anatomy may be viewed as a primary grouping of the pelvis and the legs, a secondary grouping of the ribcage and the arms and a tertiary grouping of the skull and the spine. Each of the lower limbs has the upper leg, the lower leg and a foot and each of the upper limbs has the upper arm, the lower arm and a hand. The skull, the hands and the feet feature the contrast of light with darkness and feature a characteristic of wholesome growth such as hair on the scalp of the skull and nails on the hands and feet. Each hand consists of four regular fingers and one opposable thumb. The five fingers may be considered as: the two lower fingers (i.e. the pinky and the ring finger) and the two upper fingers (i.e. the middle finger and the index finger) and the thumb. The thumb may be viewed as the head finger or the finger of wholeness. The hands are able to grasp, and the fingers, toes, hands, and feet, may be utilized for the quantification and measurement of things, events, and qualities. Each of the five fingers may be represented by the five elements of earth, water, wind, darkness and light.  Reality refers to all that exists and happens and includes the awareness of such.  The three branches of science are: chemistry, which explores the composition of what exists in relation to space, physics, which explores causes and effects of events in relation to time, and biology, which explores the makeup and processes of organisms as conscious entities that are mortal.       The six directions of space are Up, Down, North, South, West and East, the three aspects of time are past, present and future, the three states of matter are solid, liquid and gas, and the light of awareness is contrasted with the darkness of ignorance. In solids the particles are tightly packed, in liquids the particles are more loosely arranged and in gases the particles are scattered. Matter is made up of atoms and the main subatomic particles are protons, which are positively charged, electrons, which are negatively charged, and neutrons, which are neutral. A person is an awareness occupying his or her brain, which is housed by his or her skull, which is closely connected to his or her ribcage, and this is distantly connected to his or her pelvis. The pelvis may be viewed as symbolic of space by virtue of a mother’s pelvis which houses an unborn human being, the ribcage may be viewed as symbolic of time by virtue of the heart which occupies the ribcage and beats with a repetitive tempo, and the skull may be viewed as symbolic of matter by virtue of the brain which occupies the skull and houses the energy of the will.       The heart is a strong and rhythmic pump, which consists of four chambers, and which circulates blood around the body, and the brain may be divided into the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere, and is the control center for the body. The scalp of the skull is typically hidden by hair and represents darkness and ignorance whereas the face is exposed and represents light and knowledge. The face of a mature female is usually more exposed than the face of a mature male. The symbol of occupant depicts masculinity and the symbol of house depicts femininity.       A child is an interwoven wholeness growing out of the blissful union of his or her father with his or her mother. The pelvis may be viewed as a feminine house of beauty shadowed by ugliness, the ribcage as a masculine house of strength shadowed by weakness, and the skull as a neutral house of knowledge shadowed by ignorance.       The buttocks reject the death-suggesting waste of harm from the pelvis, the breasts of a mother offer the life-sustaining food of help from the ribcage, and the head transcends categorization as masculine or feminine and signifies neutrality. The bodies of females tend to resemble the shape of a pear due to a wider pelvis, the bodies of males tend to resemble the shape of an apple due to a wider ribcage, and the body of a child may be symbolically represented as a mango or a skull by virtue of the way in which the Sun is centered at the helm of the Solar System.       The skin of the mango is symbolic of the outer protective skull, the watery pulp is symbolic of the grey matter of the brain, and the seed is symbolic of the energy of awareness. A female who has reached the age of puberty typically operates according to a 28-day menstrual cycle which begins with a 5-day purging of old material from the lining of the womb in a flow of blood and this cycle repeats itself until late adulthood and is suspended during pregnancy. The schedule of the Moon orbiting the Planet Earth and the schedule of a mature female’s menstrual cycle are concurrent and the Moon influences the tides of the ocean.       3 is typically interpreted as the number of wholeness and growth as the feminine and masculine opposites of duality transcend their boundaries to unite as one in magnificent celebration. A child partakes of life hidden in the mother’s pelvis prior to birth before partaking of life exposed in the supposed domain of the father after birth, and the awareness is hidden from the physical body by the maternal brain when asleep and exposed to the paternal physical body when awake.       Therefore, a mother of space (i.e. the pelvis) and a father of time (i.e. the ribcage) has been juxtaposed (connected by the neck) with a child of matter and energy (i.e. the skull). The 3 dimensions of space, the 3 tenses of time, the 3 states of matter and the contrast between darkness and light amount to 11 aspects of existence. This structure describes a family of 4 which may arguably be construed as a family of 3 because matter and energy are scientifically interchangeable.  This may be encrypted in characteristics of nature as well as provide guidance to the species from nature as represented via natural appetites and this feature of nature may be purely natural or may involve divine design. Sophistication of form and/or function usually necessitates prior design. Life is uniformly characterized by the existence of opposites.  Be mindful that the relationships in nature are comprised of the feminine aspect, the masculine aspect, and the transcendent aspect of wholeness in a manner analogous to the significance of the colors black, white and gray. The color black absorbs energy whereas the color white reflects energy. The color gray is a balanced mixture of the color black and the color white.       In sexual relations between a male and a female, the male is the solidified donor and the female is the liquefied recipient and this is analogous to the celestial relationship between the Sun which gives light for the Moon to reflect. The color black takes whereas the color white gives thus suggesting that the color black is a feminine characteristic whereas the color white is a masculine characteristic. The union of a male and a female facilitates wholesome growth. The relentless masculine Sun and the elegant feminine Moon apparently serve as parents to the transcendent explosion of life known as the Planet Earth. Analogically, the house and occupant relationship is featured in reproductive activity between a female and a male, in an unborn child residing within an expecting mother and in an entity of life residing within the cosmos.       In human beings, the two female egg-producing glands are the ovaries, which are located separate from each other, whereas the two male egg-producing glands are the testes, which are located together. The union of moving toward an object of pursuit may possibly be interpreted as the masculine force of love, the separation of moving away from an object of avoidance may possibly be interpreted as the feminine force of fear, and wholesome freedom transcends a fixed direction. Psychologists have documented the survival instinct, the pleasure principle, the will to superiority, the sex drive of social inclination and the identity crises as universal natural influences on the behavior of humanity. Therefore, the trichotomous forces may be delineated as feminine fear, masculine love and wholesome freedom. The inherent articles of fear are proposed as death, pain, inferiority, isolation and self-ignorance and the inherent articles of love are proposed as life, pleasure, superiority, connection and self-knowledge. An awareness of this psychological heritage of humanity facilitates more opportunities for empathetic interaction between people.       The masculinity of the male gender is epitomized by the male reproductive organ which is high, sensitive and erect whereas the femininity of the female gender is epitomized by inner and outer lips which hearken of a hereditary or artificially induced fullness that may appear in the lips on the face of a person decorating the skull, the breasts of a woman decorating the ribcage, and the buttocks of a person decorating the pelvis. The male reproductive apparatus also features a sac of reproductive material and the female reproductive apparatus features a miniature erect sensitivity. A banana is reminiscent of a penis and a strawberry is reminiscent of a clitoris. Additionally, a mountain is illustrative of a penis and a basin is illustrative of a vagina. The pelvic bone of some females is legendarily enamoring with outward curves of beauty whereas the triumph of masculinity is the higher propensity for muscle development constituting dominant masculine strength in some males. For reproduction to occur in nature between human beings, the strength of the male reproductive organ must be strong enough to access the inner recesses of the female reproductive passage and the initial occurrence of such a connection results in drops of blood from the torn hymen of a female.       The arousal of a male due to the sight of a ripe and attractive female may be analogous to a tree ascending to the perfection of the Sun or the rain of the clouds. If a female is fertile ground for the male deposit of sufficient quality then life may perpetuate. In human beings, the sublime bliss of peak sexual stimulation may be enjoyed alone or in concert with another. The fusion of the individual male spermatozoon on an odyssey with the individual female ovum of destiny generates a third transcendent entity of new life not resident within the singular gametes in reproduction amongst human beings. The natural categories of superiority are inferred to be attractiveness, strength, knowledge, highness and fullness and the natural categories of inferiority are inferred to be repulsiveness, weakness, ignorance, lowness and emptiness. There is also an innate tendency towards the pride of showcasing traits of superiority and the shame of hiding traits of inferiority in human beings.       Love may be intuitively viewed as masculine solidity due to the closeness of pursuit, fear may be viewed as feminine liquidity due to the enhanced flexibility of avoidance and freedom may be viewed as gaseous wholeness due to the possibility of maximum expansion with the light of pride affording exposure to virtues and the darkness of shame affording concealment to vices. The tenets of love and fear are time-oriented with regard to what happens in life and the tenets of pride and shame are space oriented with regard to the configuration of what exists in life.  

consider the composition of the universe and the cycles of the solar system.  consider physical, mental, emotional and ethical reflexes and the freedom of the will to make decisions from among options.  consider the science of attraction.  consider the way in which a human being is a microcosm of the macrocosm of existence.  consider that there may be a symbology and numerology of nature. 

 Though you can write your own short story whenever you want, you'll be able to write more effectively if you have read a wide variety of short stories, from classics to contemporary pieces. Once you've read enough short stories, you'll have a better sense of the elements of a short story, and a deeper understanding of what will appeal to an audience. Pick your favorite stories and pay attention to how they start. See what works and doesn't work in an opening.   Read the short stories of classic writers such as Edgar Allan Poe, Anton Chekhov, and Guy de Maupassant. Read the short stories of writers from the earlier part of the 20th century, such as Isaac Babel, Ernest Hemingway, Flannery O'Connor, or Jorge Luis Borges. Read the short stories of more contemporary masters of the short story, such as Alice Munro, Raymond Carver, and Jhumpa Lahiri. Join a writing workshop, either in school or in your community, and read the works of other writers who are still honing their craft. Sometimes, the works of true masters can be overwhelming, and reading the work of writers who are starting out can make you feel like your task is more surmountable.  Your amazing opening won't work if you don't know how to follow it up with a strong middle and end. Though short stories vary in their narration and subject matter, and some stories are traditional while others take a more experimental track, you should be aware of the key aspects of a good short story:   Plot. The plot is "what happens" in a story. Stories that are plot-driven are heavily dependent on what happens next, such as the detective stories of Poe. Some short stories follow the pattern of having rising action, a crisis, and falling action, while others start in the middle of a crisis, or end with a crisis without telling the reader what happens next.  Your plot doesn't have to be as structured like a detective story, but there should always be a sense that there is something at stake, whether it's whether a character can come to understand that her husband is unfaithful, or if a character can win a much-anticipated spelling bee to please her father.   Character. Your story should have at least one character that your readers can care about and root for. Typically, your character should be sympathetic so your characters can better understand his motives, but if the character is original, well-realized, and fascinating, your readers will love reading about him whether he's sympathetic or not. Dialogue. Dialogue can be considered the poetry in the prose and should be used sparingly to convey a character's voice. However, there some writers, such as Hemingway or Carver, who write excellent stories that are very heavy in dialogue. Point-of-view. Point of view is the perspective that the story is told from. It can be told in the first person, second person, or third person. First person is directly from the perspective of a character, second person addresses the reader as "you," and third person creates a distance between the narrator and the characters. Setting is where and when the story takes place. Setting can be crucial to a story, such as the setting of the Southern works of William Faulkner, or it can play a more minor role.  Though there are many different ways to write, it will help to take some time to consider the story you have in mind. Maybe you were inspired by something you saw, or have always been fascinated by a strange story about your grandfather's childhood. Whatever your reason for writing the story, it can help to ask yourself a few questions before you begin:   Will your story work better in the first, second, or third person? Though you can experiment with these perspectives once you begin writing, thinking about which point of view will be more appropriate in advance can help you start strong. Where and when will your story take place? If your story will take place in a town you don't know much about, or in a time period that you don't know very well, you may have to do some research before you can begin to write your story with confidence. How many characters will there be in your story? If you have a sense of the main players in your story, you'll have a better understanding of how long and detailed the story should be. Don't underestimate the power of writing without a plan. If you're inspired, just put a pen to paper and see what happens. If trying to plan out your story before you start bogs you down, just dive right in and figure out the details as you go along.  Relax and write the first thing that comes to mind. You don't have to figure out which character or form of narration you'll be using. Just start writing without stopping to think for a few minutes and see what happens.   Write for at least ten minutes without stopping. Once you're done, you should read over what you've written to see how your opening sounds, or to see if you can find a good starting point somewhere in the pages you've filled. Don't stop to correct your work for grammar or punctuation. This may slow you down and will make you self-conscious about your ideas. You can perfect your writing later.  Though flashbacks take the risk of being sentimental or confusing the reader, they can draw the reader in, and make your reader wonder about how the story moved from the past to the present.   Pick a moment that was memorable to a character. It can be a truly dramatic moment in the character's life, or it can be a significant memory that is developed later in the story. If you choose to start with a flashback, make sure that your readers know when you've transitioned into the present, or you will lose or confuse them. Start with a moment when a character acts in a surprising way. Move to the present, and leave your reader to wonder why the character would have acted this way.  Don't be afraid to start with a bold voice that says a lot about the main character and tells the reader what to expect in the rest of the story. The opening of a story sets the terms of the story and helps the reader interpret the events that take place, so a clear, bold statement can help hook your readers.   Melville's novel Moby Dick simply starts with the statement "Call me Ishmael." From there, the narrator talks of his love of sea voyages, and about how much the ocean means to him. This statement draws the reader in and makes him feel more comfortable with the main character. Though this is the opening of a novel, it would work just as well for a short story. Amy Bloom's story, "The Story," opens with the line, "You wouldn't have known me a year ago." This simple-but-direct opening draws in the reader and makes him want to know more about this character, and why this character has changed. Chekhov's "Lady With a Little Dog" begins with the statement, "It was said that a new person had appeared on the sea front: a lady with a little dog." This story continues to discuss Gurov, another guest on the sea front, who begins to take an interest in this woman, and eventually delves into their passionate love affair. The statement is simple yet effective, and leaves the reader wanting to know more about this woman. The right line of dialogue can also grab your readers and provide insight into the person who is saying it, but be aware that starting a story with a line of dialogue is tricky.  Your character doesn't have to speak to the reader right away. Instead, you can let your reader see your character in action, to show the kind of person your character is and what is at stake for him or her in the story. Here are some ways to start with characterization:   Begin with your character's quirk. Maybe your character likes to eat a meal with two forks, or maybe your character showers with his shoes on. Tell your readers what makes your character unique. Reveal what your character is thinking. Invite your readers into your character's head to let them know whether she's wondering about the gender of her baby, or worried about her mother's new memory lapses. Show the character interacting with others. Letting your readers see how the character interacts with her mother, or an old friend she ran into on the streets, can provide insight into who he is and what he'll do next. Describe your character's physical appearance. Your character's appearance can say a lot about him or her. Don't bore your reader with the ordinary details. Instead, show how your character looks to other people, or describe an aspect of the character's appearance that most people will overlook. A typical short story is around 15-25 pages in length, so you don't have to worry about developing ten believable characters. Work on having an engaging protagonist, and a few other interesting characters, but know that not all of the minor characters have to have depth.  Tell your reader what is at stake in your story from the very first line or paragraph. In a short story, you only have so much time to develop your ideas, so if you start with the dramatic tension of the story, you can work backwards to explain why it's so important. Here are some ways to do it:   Tell your readers a secret. Say, "Mary had been sleeping with her sister's husband for the past three months." As you tell your readers more about this situation and how Mary is being forced to deal with it, your readers will feel included in the drama and will be waiting to see how it unfurls. Introduce a conflict. Say, "Bobby hadn't seen his brother Sam in over twenty years. He wondered if he would have the nerve to show up to their father's funeral." These two sentences already set up the central conflicts for the reader: that Bobby and his brother have stopped speaking for some reason, and that Bobby may have to confront him. As the story unfolds, the reader will want to know why the brothers stopped talking. Hint at something significant from the character's past. Say, "The second time Anna left her husband was just before her eightieth birthday." Without giving the story away, you can show your readers that the story will describe why Anna was leaving her husband again, and why she did it the first time.  Another way to start a story is to develop the setting. If the city or home where the story is set is significant, you can let your readers know about what it looks, smells, and sounds like before you develop the characters or plot. Here's how to do it:   Focus on sensory details. Tell your readers what a place looks, sounds, smells, and even feels like to the touch. Is it freezing in the story, or is it the hottest summer on record? Anchor your readers. Without being too obvious, let them know where you are and when the story is taking place. Though you don't have to announce the year and location, provide enough information for your readers to figure it out. Show how the setting relates to your characters. Pretend like you're a camera zooming in from bird's eye view to the home of a character. Start by looking at the whole town, neighborhood, and then show how your main character fits into this environment, or is a product of this environment. Don't bore your readers. Though describing the setting in just the right amount of detail can grab your readers, if you're starting out as a writer, this may not be the way to go. Your readers may be impatient and will want to know who or what your story is about, not just where it's set.  As you choose your opening, beware of falling into a trap by starting your opening in a way that is too predictable, confusing, cliched, or just overwhelming. Here's what not to do:   Avoid clichés. Don't start your story with a trite image or an overused line like, "Sarah's heart was torn to shreds." This will make your readers think that the rest of your story won't be very original either. Avoid the "information dump." You don't have to tell your readers who the story is about, where your story is set, what conflict is at stake, and what your main character looks like all in the first two pages of the story. Think of writing as helping your readers climb a mountain. You want to give them enough information so they can move forward, but if you give them way too much information, then they'll be bogged down and will fall. Avoid starting your story with a lot of questions or exclamation marks. Let the story speak for itself instead of trying too hard to convey excitement. Don't confuse your readers with fancy language. Above all, make sure your readers know what the heck is going on in your story. You can sacrifice a few beautiful lines of imagery or too-clever dialogue to help your readers understand what's happening.  Now that you've written your opening as well as a draft or two of your story, you should reflect on the story as a whole to see if the opening still fits. You should make sure that the opening hooks the reader, sets the tone for the rest of the piece, and puts the reader on the right track. Here's what you should do:   Read your story twice. First, read it to yourself without marking it, and then read it with a pen to mark any places where you want to cut passages or where you'll need to add information to bring the story together. Once you do this, you'll have a better sense of whether the opening is working or not. See if you can start later in the story. The first few pages of a rough draft of a story can often just be the writer's way of clearing his throat before he can cut to the heart of the story. You may find that your opening provides too many unnecessary background details and that you're better off starting on page 2 — or even page 10. Read your story aloud. When you read your work aloud, you may notice things that you wouldn't have caught while reading the words on the page. You'll be able to tell if your story flows naturally and if it has dialogue that is compelling and believable from the very beginning.  Once you feel confident about the rough draft of your story, you should be ready to ask for feedback. Remember that asking for feedback too early in the writing process, before you even really have a sense of what you're writing about, can discourage you from pursuing your ideas. Having the right opinion can help you revise your opening, as well as the rest of your story. Tell your readers that you're focusing on the opening but would like an overall opinion as well. Here are some places to turn for feedback:   Ask a friend who loves reading short stories and is able to give constructive feedback. Ask a friend who is a fellow writer. Turn your story in to a writer's workshop and pay attention to the feedback that you get, especially about the opening. Remember that your opening won't be effective if the rest of the story doesn't come together. Once you feel confident about your story and want to try to get it published, try sending it out to a number of literary journals. Even if your story is not accepted, you may receive valuable feedback from editors.  

read as many short stories as you can.  understand the components of a short story.  reflect on the story you want to write.  start with your intuition.  start with a compelling flashback.  start with a strong declarative statement.  start with characterization.  introduce the stakes of the story.  develop the setting.  avoid the pitfalls of short story openings.  reflect on what you've written.  ask for an outside opinion. 

 House wrens create a number of nests, including dummy nests, in order to claim territory and ward off competitors. They also use dummy nests to cover the eggs and hatchlings of competitors, making it impossible for them to incubate their eggs or feed their young. Dummy nests consist of loose sticks, whereas an active nest has a lining of feathers and often eggs. Removing dummy nests makes it easier for other species to nest in a box. It is illegal to remove an active house wren nest. Make sure it is a dummy nest before removing. Removing dummy nests requires constant monitoring because house wrens will return and repeatedly try to rebuild them. Use a birdcam to watch the nestbox. Do not drop sticks from dummy nest on the ground near the nestbox. House wrens will reuse the sticks if left nearby.; , House wrens often return to nestboxes with old nests, perhaps because they indicate a safe location from predators and competitors. If you want to make sure house wrens do not nest in a certain location, be sure to clean out any old nests at the end of the season.House wren nests are usually empty by fall.  If a nestbox has a dummy nest inside, place a cap over the hole to discourage house wrens from returning. This can be done with a rubber drain stopper or a piece of cork. Plugging a nestbox for a few weeks may convince local house wrens to move on to new territory and open up space for new tenets. Although this may drive the house wrens away from one particular nestbox, it may also encourage them to move on to another one with birds actively nesting in it.  House wrens love tiny nestboxes, particularly the tiny ornamental birdhouses that can be found in many backyards. Multiple small boxes placed close together have a tendency to create large populations of house wrens and drive out other species. On the other hand, bigger boxes placed over a large area tended to facilitate the growth of other bird species. It is believed that house wrens prefer the smaller floors of little nestboxes because they offer a better space for building their compact nests.  Slot, Gilbertson and Gilwood boxes have openings that make it easier for house wrens to fill them with sticks and create dummy nests. They also tend to have a smaller size that house wrens are drawn to. Use nestboxes with openings that make it difficult for house wrens to create dummy nests.House wrens prefer a home with a diameter of roughly 1 1/8 inches. Making a hole smaller than this may prevent their entry. Avoid gourd nestboxes, which also seem to attract house wrens.  

clean out dummy nests.  remove old nests.  plug the nestbox hole.  use larger nestboxes.  try nestboxes with smaller holes. 

 One of the most important steps to take for reducing the risk of getting an infection while staying in a hospital or clinical setting is washing your hands properly — at least with soap and water, but preferably also with alcohol-based gels or wipes.Washing your hands is not only important after going to the bathroom, but also, after you touch any other surface or person outside the bathroom. Surfaces to be particularly careful of are doorknobs, light switches, bedside railings, curtains, bedside tables and medical equipment and paraphernalia.   Consider using the paper towel you used to dry your hands with in the bathroom as a barrier over doorknobs and bedside rails. Once you're back in bed, throw the paper towel in a nearby garbage bin. Make sure there is a dispenser of alcohol-based hand sanitizer within reach of your bed. Once you return to bed from the bathroom, sanitize your hands again.; , Touching other patients, even for compassionate reasons, isn't a good idea in hospitals or other long-term care facilities. They may be harboring antibiotic-resistant bacteria or super pathogenic viruses on their skin or clothing that can infect you and make you very ill. Conversely, you may transfer similar pathogenic microorganisms to them and put their lives at stake. Talking and listening to other patients is fine and often passes the time faster, but never contact other patient's wounds or bandages and don't shake their hands. Also, avoid sharing towels, washcloths, razors or clothes   If you or any surrounding patients are coughing repeatedly, then consider wearing a surgical mask when in close proximity. Viruses and bacteria travel and become airborne within droplets of saliva and mucus. Common HAIs include Clostridium difficile (C. diff), MRSA, Acinetobacter, Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), hepatitis, Klebsiella norovirus, and more.MRSA stands for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria because they are resistant to several common antibiotics.MRSA bacteria developed in hospitals decades ago due to overuse of antibiotics. Now, there are only a few powerful drugs that can contain MRSA bacteria.  It should go without saying that you shouldn't touch medical equipment because you may disrupt the function or change the settings (which can put your life at risk), but medical devices and paraphernalia are also commonly contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms. In fact, some of the most deadly vectors of infection can survive for weeks on medical equipment and in patient rooms.As such, keep your hands to yourself and your curiosity in check by not touching any medical devices, intravenous paraphernalia or nearby diagnostic equipment.   Each year more than 18,000 American patients die from MRSA infections that they contract while in hospitals.In addition to bacteria, serious viruses to be concerned about in a hospital setting include MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)., Even if you're diligent about washing and sanitizing your hands while in the hospital, it's a good idea to break the habit of touching your face, particularly your mouth and eyes. Bacteria and viruses on your hands are unlikely to lead to infections there (unless you have cuts or abrasions), but your eyes and mouth are entry points into your body where pathogenic microorganisms can take advantage and multiply if the conditions are right. If they can penetrate the mucous membranes of the eyes and mouth, they can also gain access to the bloodstream and infect other parts of the body.   If you don't already wear glasses, consider wearing clear plastic eye protection to prevent yourself from touching or rubbing your eyes. Women need to take special precaution against transmitting germs while applying their eye makeup and lipstick. Within a hospital setting, it's safer to go without makeup.When using alcohol-based hand rubs and sanitizers, products with at least 60% alcohol content are preferred., Always remember that your immune system is designed to fight off pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses, so that is ultimately your best ally in preventing hospital infections. The main problem is that most people who enter a hospital or clinic are sick and have compromised or weakened immunity, which makes them particularly susceptible to infections. As such, make sure to eat lots of fresh produce and keep well hydrated. Fruits and veggies are loaded with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and other compounds that can kill bacteria and viruses.Drinking lots of water keeps your blood volume up and mucous membranes moist, making it difficult for pathogens to penetrate inside your body.   Preparing fresh fruit smoothies before you head into the hospital for a procedure is a good idea, or have your family bring them to you on a regular basis. Snacking on raw veggies (broccoli, tomatoes, cucumbers) is another great way of getting important nutrients into your body. Your immune system will benefit by avoiding refined sugars while in the hospital (soda pop, candy, ice cream, desserts, most baked goods). Supplements that can boost immunity include vitamins A, C and D, zinc, selenium, echinacea, olive leaf extract and astragalus root.Remember not to take supplements of any kind without consulting a doctor first. They may interact with medications or medical conditions.  Research suggests that bathing hospital patients daily with a mild antibacterial soap can reduce skin and bloodstream infections dramatically.Hospital nurses and support staff are typically very busy and probably don't enjoy constantly cleaning ill patients, but ask or remind them politely to help you with such tasks on a daily basis. This is particularly important if you're unable to get to the bathroom to urinate or defecate. Changing adult diapers is not enough by itself — it should be followed by daily baths.   The antiseptic soap of choice is chlorhexidine gluconate, and it comes in several forms, including bars and wipes. It's available over the counter, so consider buying a few bars if you anticipate a longer hospital stay. Some medical experts believe it's helpful for surgery patients to shower with chlorhexidine soap both the night before and morning of their surgery., Don't make the assumption that all hospital staff are equally trained or conscientious about preventing the spread of infections — they aren't. Take it upon yourself to politely remind or ask all staff who approach you to sanitize their hands in front of you at your bedside.Some health care professionals might take mild offense to such as request, but be polite and remind them it's for everybody's safety. Hospital staff get busy and touch lots of people and equipment in a short period of time, so they're usually not being lazy or irresponsible, just harried and stressed.   Hospitals that place dispensers of alcohol-based hand sanitizer at more locations (patient rooms, hallways, nursing stations, near elevators) see dramatic increases in the staff's compliance with basic hand hygiene — often from less than 50% compliance to 80% or more.Hospital staff often wear latex surgical gloves to protect themselves from patients, but sometimes forget that the gloves need to be changed on a very regular basis in order to ensure the patient's safety. It's not rude to request that a staff member change his gloves in from of you, but always be courteous. If you feel self-conscious about it, you can keep it light and say something like — "I'm a little paranoid about germs. It would make me feel a lot better if I could see you change your gloves."  , If you notice any spills in your hospital room (or anywhere else in the hospital), notify the staff of it so they can properly clean it up. This is particularly important with body wastes (feces, urine) and other fluids (blood, vomit, saliva, mucus) because they tend to harbor various microorganisms that can lead to infections.However, spilled food and drink can also provide a breading ground for bacteria and mold. The hospital staff should have strict protocols in how to deal with spills, and not just use a standard mop and bucket.   Remember that patients and visitors should never clean up a spill in a hospital, even if you're just trying to help out and be nice. Let the professionals do their job and keep yourself safe. Body fluid/waste spills are much more common in intensive care, emergency and geriatric wards of a hospital, so be extra cautious if you are in such areas.  Observe if the procedures performed by the hospital staff are done using the "aseptic technique." The aseptic technique simply means that procedures and materials used on you are always clean and sterile.For example, any diagnostic instrument used on you should be either new, freshly sanitized or covered with a clean wrap, cover, tip, etc. Instruments or tools should not be used on you directly after another patient without some form of sanitation. The use of fresh gloves, masks, paper on examining tables and so on is also part of the aseptic technique.   If you have an intravenous catheter in your arm, try to keep the skin around the dressing clean and dry. Tell the nurse immediately if the dressing works loose or gets wet, as that's a breach of the aseptic technique protocol. Ideally, hospital staff shouldn't wear rings, watches and jewelry around patients because they are difficult to sanitize. Feel free to ask them to remove such items while attending to you.  

disinfect your hands frequently.  don't touch other patients.  don't touch medical equipment or machines.  keep your hands away from your eyes and mouth.  try to eat nutritiously and drink lots of purified water.  ask for daily bathing with antiseptic agents.  ask all staff to sanitize their hands before touching you.  notify the staff of any spills, especially body fluids.  make sure the hospital staff practices the aseptic technique.

 There are two primary cataloging systems: the Dewey Decimal Classification system (DDC) and the Library of Congress Classification system (LCC). In 1876, Melvil Dewey developed the DDC system. Today, it is the most common cataloging system in the world. This system provides the perfect amount of details for small libraries and book collections. If you are looking for a system that generates a more detailed call number, consider using the LCC system. In 1891, the Library of Congress developed its own system of classification. In order to keep track of its enormous collection, it needed a system that was more specific than Dewey’s. The LLC system is used by major research libraries., The DDC system organizes books by main class, division, and section. Every call number also includes a Cutter Number to identify the author and the edition date.   Main Class: 800 (Literature) Division: 10 (American Literature in English) Section: 3.54 (American Fiction in English) To get the call number, add up the three numbers: 800+10+3.54=813. Following this number, you may add a Cutter Number to identify the author (the first letter of the author’s last name) and the edition date. When this information is added, the call number becomes: 813.54 M 2007., The LCC system catalogues books by class, subclass, and topic area. Every call number also includes a Cutter Number to identify the author, a Cutter Number to identify the title, the edition date.   Class: P (Language and Literature) Subclass: R (English Literature) Topic Area: 9199.3 (Provincial, Local, etc.) Cutter Number, Author: M3855 Cutter Number, Title: L54 Edition Date: 2007 Additional Information: c.2 To construct the call number, list the components sequentially like so: PR9199.3.M3855.L54.2007.c.2.

 Use a comb to divide your bangs from the rest of your hair. Comb through your bangs to remove any snarls or kinks.   If you are in a pinch, use your fingers instead of a comb.  Pull your bangs straight up from your head. Twist the hair away from your face. Twisting your bangs will ensure that your braid will rest along your hairline instead of across your forehead. Divide your bangs into three equal sections and then proceed to braid your hair. Stop once the braid is 4 to 5 inches long.  With one hand, hold the braid in place against your head; with the other hand, insert one bobby pin downwards through the braid. Retrieve a second bobby pin and insert it into the braid so that it forms an “X” with the first pin. This will prevent the pins from slipping.        

section off your bangs.  braid your bangs.  secure the braid in place. 

 The Pythagorean Theorem describes the relationship between the sides of a right triangle.It states that for any right triangle with sides of length a and b, and hypotenuse of length c, a2 + b2 = c2., The Pythagorean Theorem only works on right triangles, and by definition only right triangles can have a hypotenuse. If your triangle contains one angle that is exactly 90 degrees, it is a right triangle and you can proceed.   Right angles are often notated in textbooks and on tests with a small square in the corner of the angle. This special mark means "90 degrees."  , The variable "c" will always be assigned to the hypotenuse, or longest side. Choose one of the other sides to be a, and call the other side b (it doesn't matter which is which; the math will turn out the same). Then copy the lengths of a and b into the formula, according to the following example:   If your triangle has sides of 3 and 4, and you have assigned letters to those sides such that a = 3 and b = 4, then you should write your equation out as: 32 + 42 = c2.  To find the square of a number, you simply multiply the number by itself, so a2 = a x a. Find the squares of both a and b, and write them into your formula.   If a = 3, a2 = 3 x 3, or 9. If b = 4, then b2 = 4 x 4, or 16. When you plug those values into your equation, it should now look like this: 9 + 16 = c2.  Enter this into your equation, and this will give you the value for c2. There is only one step left to go, and you will have that hypotenuse solved!   In our example, 9 + 16 = 25, so you should write down 25 = c2.  Use the square root function on your calculator (or your memory of the multiplication table) to find the square root of c2. The answer is the length of your hypotenuse!   In our example, c2 = 25. The square root of 25 is 5 (5 x 5 = 25, so Sqrt(25) = 5). That means c = 5, the length of our hypotenuse!  

learn the pythagorean theorem.  make sure that your triangle is a right triangle.  assign variables a, b, and c to the sides of your triangle.  find the squares of a and b.  add together the values of a2 and b2.  find the square root of c2. 

 Another easy way to get out fold from a vinyl shower curtain is to place it in your washing machine with a load of towels. The heat and water in the machine will help to massage out the folds in the vinyl, with little manpower or work on your end.      ; , Select the gentle cycle and turn on the washing machine. You will then need to watch the machine until it hits the rinse cycle. Once the machine hits the rinse cycle, remove the curtain from the washing machine.It will be dripping wet at this point, but that’s okay as you are going to let it dry over your bathtub.  Take the dripping shower curtain and gently hang it up over your bathtub using the shower curtain rings. Make sure the bottom of the shower curtain is inside the bathtub, not on the outside, so the dripping water will go into the tub.  Once you have hung up the shower curtain, let it dry overnight. The weight of the dripping water as well as the exposure to air should flatten out any folds in the curtain. 

place the curtain in the washing machine with a load of towels.  choose a warm water setting.  hang the shower curtain over your bathtub.  allow the curtain to dry.

 Generally clothing that is rolled takes up less space than folded clothing. You may also wish to investigate "bundling" techniques when packing. Pack smaller items in ziplock bags, press down to remove any excess air. This compresses items into a smaller package.    Always place liquids inside resealable bags. These will contain any leaks that might occur. Leaks are inevitable when flying, due to pressure changes, so don't take any chances.       How much makeup do you really need? Mineral makeup can make it easier to have one or two items do many different contouring, highlighting and concealing jobs all at once, rather than carrying all the different containers.  Remove anything that seems as if you could live without it. Then take a photograph of it all on your smartphone. That way, you'll have a permanent visual record of what you've packed; no need to remember any lists when repacking at each hotel, campground or resort.  

roll your soft gear.  if toiletries are readily available at a reasonable price at your destination, consider buying them there, and only take a few days supply with you.  lay everything you're taking out on the bed. 

 This is a classic steak marinade that brings out the best flavors in the meat. The combination of sweet and savory flavors will make your mouth water. Mix together the following ingredients to make your marinade:   2 medium shallots, minced 1 tablespoon dried thyme leaves 3 tablespoons (packed) dark brown sugar 1/4 cup soy sauce 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1/3 cup vegetable oil  , Marinating the steak in salt and pepper overnight causes the flavors to seep into the cut of meat, so you'll taste savory heat all the way to the center of the meat when you cook it. Here's what you'll need for this marinade:   1 1/2 teaspoons of salt 2 teaspoons freshly ground pepper 1 teaspoon garlic salt 1/4 cup water 1/4 cup vegetable or canola oil 2 tablespoons of white vinegar  , This marinade is perfect for steak, but you can also use it for chicken or pork. It's easy to throw together. Mix the following ingredients well, then pour the marinade over raw steak:   1 1/2 cups steak sauce 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1/3 cup Italian-style salad dressing 1/3 cup honey 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

 Squeeze your feet into the new leather shoes.  Heat each shoe in turn with a hairdryer, bending your feet back and forth as much as is possible. Blow with heat for 20-30 seconds at a time.  Keep the shoes on as they cool.  Put on thinner socks or pantyhose. Try on the shoes. If you can feel enough of a difference, the shoes are stretched. If not, repeat the process.  This conditioning will restore any depleted moisture caused by the heat.  

put on a really thick pair of socks.  sit somewhere comfortable.  remove the heat.  remove the thick socks.  apply leather shoe conditioner or saddle soap. 

 As soon as you get stung, get the stinger out of your skin. This is the most important thing you can do! Some people suggest that scraping the stinger out with a credit card is better than pinching it out, but this is more likely to slow down the removal. Some scientists don’t think this is even true, and that removing the stinger as quickly as possible is the best thing you can do.Get it out with your fingernails, if possible. Otherwise grab tweezers or whatever else you have handy.; , The cold water will be soothing and the soap can help wash away any residual dirt or venom. Lather up well and rinse the area thoroughly., Even if you’ve been stung by a bee before without any problem, be on the alert for signs that you’re having an allergic reaction. Allergies can develop or worsen over time. Severe reactions (anaphylaxis) can by life-threatening. Watch out for any of the following signs of anaphylaxis:Difficulty breathing or wheezing Swelling of the lips, tongue, face, or throat  Dizziness, fainting, or a drop in blood pressure Skin reaction like hives, flushing, itching, or paleness A fast, weak pulse Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea Restlessness and anxiety   , If any of the above symptoms are present, call for emergency help right away. While you’re waiting for help to arrive (or on your way to the hospital), take Benadryl or another antihistamine. If you have an EpiPen, use it.   After you’ve been treated, see your doctor for a prescription for an EpiPen – a shot of epinephrine that you keep on hand in case of another reaction.  

remove the stinger as quickly as possible.  wash the area with soap and cold water.  watch out for symptoms of an allergic reaction.  call emergency services if you’re having an allergic reaction. 

 None of the rest of this is going to do you any good if you can't get hold of yourself now. At this point the slightest case of misty eyes will keep that swelling going. Take deep breaths and make yourself concentrate on something else. You can fall apart again when you're alone.; , First thing you should do is wash your face with very cold water. Keep your eyes open while you splash. (If you have contact lenses, you should take them out for at least a few minutes.) This is calming, too, if you're having problems with step 1. Pat your face dry.  It's healthy for you. It'll help get rid of your headache and replace the fluid you lost from all those tears.  Visine (or any other eye drops that treat red eyes) is a must. Use a drop on your nose and lips, too, since it'll constrict the blood vessels.  If you're really puffy, take ibuprofen (Advil) right away. It'll reduce the swelling and help the headache you probably have. Then make a cold compress--a frozen gel pack wrapped in a damp washcloth is ideal--and apply it to your eyes, nose, and lips. Keep it shifting; if you leave it too long in one place you'll only make it redder.  If you wear contacts, now is the time to clean them and put them back in if you want to. If you have glasses as an alternative, however, opt for those. Thick-framed glasses especially distract from anything that's abnormal behind them. If you're a guy, this is your stop--go forth and be your stoic self. If you're a girl, move on to step 7.  It's best not to go through your entire makeup routine. You're not going to a party (at least, you shouldn't -- you're in no shape for that). You're facing other human beings only briefly and out of necessity. The idea is to look like you weren't expecting to see anyone, and you have nothing to hide or worry about. You're perfectly fine!   Concealer: With the lightest shade you have, put a dot just below your lower lash line (i.e., the part that's probably plum purple). Blend it horizontally where you'd put eyeliner. If the rest of your under-eye region is discolored, touch that up with a slightly darker shade of concealer if you have it. Put a dab on the tip of your nose and on each side of the base, too. Lashes: Put a light coat of mascara on your lower lashes. Curl your upper lashes firmly, but don't apply mascara there. This will keep your eyes looking natural and un-made-up, but will cause your eyes to look more open. Lips: If your lips are still punched-in-the-mouth puffy and red, put a dab of nude lipstick on, or spread on a tiny dot of concealer and then apply lip balm.  Put on a brave smile and eyeglasses if you have them. If your ex's friends spot you on the street, they'll carry back the message that you look to be doing fine without him!  

settle down.  wash your face.  drink some water.  treat redness.  treat swelling.  use eyewear.  let makeup help.  meet the world.

 Ground balls are those that aren’t caught, but instead hit the ground. If you are out of range to catch the ball, get into the habit of approaching the ball to position yourself to secure a grounded ball. Once you are facing a ball’s path of direction, take a modified athletic stance. Bend your knees so that you are close to the ground, position your glove with your fingers facing the ground, and have your free hand hovered above your glove to secure the ball.          Avoid catching the ball on a short hop. The short hop is when the ball first hits the ground and bounces in an unpredictable way. Avoid rushing the ball to avoid catching the ball on a short hop.Stay on the balls of your feet to quickly reposition yourself to catch the ball.  The key to a successful dive that won’t cause injury is all about your approach. Keep your eye on the ball the entire time. Begin by running towards the ball while lowering your body by bending your knees with each step. On your last two steps extend your arms outwards to align your glove with the ball’s flight path. Take a leap off the ground with your glove side's foot to become airborne.   Rotate your glove hand so that the palm of the glove is facing upwards.Have your free hand out to support the catch. Don’t dive out if you are in range to normally catch the ball. It’ll take experience and practice to properly judge the distance of the ball.  Every catcher messes up in the field and there are certain things you can do to recover from an error. First, you need to locate the ball and do so quickly. To avoid “losing” the ball, keep your eye on the ball at all times. The key is to pick up the ball and throw it to the proper fieldsman.   Bend your knees as you pick up the ball and be prepared to turn and throw. A key to recovering from your mistake is to not let it get you down. You need to think fast in the field with no time to spare to reflect during a play., Footwork means the way use your feet to approach a ball. This skill is important for improving your game. Practice “square up” position, which means sprinting to a ball in order to catch the ball straight on. Other footwork techniques you can practice to catch a ball are:          Side shuffling means to move sideways towards the ball while facing forward. Alternate pushing off with each foot as you move and avoid crossing your feet. Charging means a direct sprint towards the ball. This usually ends in skidding to catch the ball. Crossover and sprint is a good approach to reach a ball to your sides. Cross one foot in front of the other and take off in a sprint. 

catch ground balls.  dive for the ball.  recover a botched catch.  improve your footwork. 

 Mountain bikes are made to take a beating and survive. Even city or small town dwellers like them, as they can turn off on dirt paths, crush over curbs, and get a little muddy without worrying about the bike breaking down. That said, a mountain bike's true purpose is to safely bomb up and down trails covered in roots, rocks, and sticks, and they will handle it accordingly.   Trail Bikes are great, all-purpose mountain bikes that can handle light and difficult trails as well as pavement and dirt roads quickly. All Mountain Bikes are made for hard, technical trails and serious riders. If you plan on hitting the trials, spending a little extra money will almost always be worth it for safety and comfort.  Stand with your feet 6 inches apart and measure from the inside of your foot up to where your leg meets your waist, between your crotch and inner thigh, in inches. Multiply this number by .67, then subtract 4" to 5" from the answer to get the estimated length of your top tube, which is the part of the frame running from the handlebars to below your seat.Use the top-tube for your measurement when possible, as seat tube (pedal to seat) measurements are tricky to determine and change from manufacturer to manufacturer.If you have a 33 inch inseam, you need a 17.5" top tube, since:33" x .67 = 21.75" 21.75" - 4" = 17.75   Specialty bike makers Lapierre & Neil Pryde have different geometry. Multiply your inseam by .62 instead of .67 if you really want one of these bikes.If your bike shop gives frame size by seat tube length, multiply your inseam by .185. The number should be the distance between the top of your seat tube and the middle of the crankshaft, the circular piece attaching the pedal to the bike., Because the angles your different tubes are joined at affects the distance between the seat, pedals, and handlebars, these measurements will change from bike to bike and rider to rider.Taking measurements is a good starting points, but you need to get the bike you feel most comfortable on. Try out different brands and a size above and below your measured size. You cannot tell if a bike is the right fit if it is the only one you try.   Your hands should rest comfortably on the handlebars so that your fingers feel free. You want your elbows slightly bent, not locked or pressed up on the handlebars Most mountain bikers prefer their handlebars 1-2" lower than their seat height, as it lowers your center of gravity. You should be able to reach the shifter and brakes without losing your balance on a properly sized bike., All mountain bikes have shock absorbers on the front wheels, allowing you to get over obstacle easily and maneuver in tricky terrain. However, serious bikers need to consider double suspension:    Hardtail: Another name for single suspension, these bikes only have shocks on the front wheel. They are lighter and cheaper options, and transition better to pavement riding.  Full-Suspension: Made for technical, tricky trails, these bikes are heavier but far more maneuverable and useful for serious mountain bikers., Bigger wheels are becoming more and more fashionable, but you cannot swap out smaller wheels if your frame is made for bigger ones. In general, you have three options for wheel size.    29 inch: These behemoth wheels are great at rolling over rocks and roots, have provide more grip to the trail. They carry momentum well downhill, letting your go faster, but they are harder to accelerate.  27.5 inch: A hybrid wheel, they have some of the speed of a classic 26" with the increased movement over rocks and roots found in a 29".  26 inch: The traditional wheel size, these are light and speedy wheels that still function well on the trail. Until 5-10 years ago, they were the standard mountain bike wheel. 

buy a mountain bike to ride hard over a variety of terrain, not ride quickly.  take your inseam measurement to determine frame size.  let comfort take precedence over the calculated measurement.  decide if your want double or single suspension.  get a frame built for bigger wheels for increased comfort and ease on hard trials. 

 In general, arguments in favor of washing a horse’s sheath focus on hygiene and reducing the chances of infection. Bacteria tend to colonize around the smegma. The exact nature of the secretion and the likelihood of infection vary from horse to horse. No matter what, an excessive build-up can lead to irritation and inflammation in any horse. In turn, the sheath can swell up, which can restrict the horse’s ability to procreate or even urinate. Some owners report that excessive smegma actually attracts flies, which carry disease., Many experts argue that a horse’s sheath “self-cleans”, so washing it by hand might actually be harmful. It could disrupt your horse’s normal physiological system or you might end up damaging its sheath in the process. Others argue that it is not necessary to wash a gelding because they have been castrated, thus reducing the horse's natural production of smegma., In the end, regardless of which side of the debate you support, you should discuss this issue with your vet. When it comes down to deciding whether or not to clean your horse's sheath, you’ll need to consider your situation — your specific horse. Some horses are more susceptible to smegma or bean build-up. This can be the result of glandular or hormonal issues. Some beans will naturally shake loose and others won’t. If left alone, these can be considerably dangerous and may even require surgery to remove., Cut them as short as possible and/or file down any sharp edges. Since a horse’s sheath is incredibly sensitive, you’ll want to eliminate the possibility of scratching the horse. Keep in mind that the horse’s instinctual response to discomfort in its nether regions will be to kick and buck, which can lead to serious injury — for you and/or the horse.  Do not use thick rubber washing gloves. This might offend your sense of propriety, but it is more important that you retain your tactile senses. You’ll need to be able to feel for any built-up smegma secretions or beans., They can hold the reins, which will keep the horse facing a specific direction. They can also brush the horse to calm them while you do the dirty business. If you are alone tie the horse safely and securely.  This helps you feel for your horse’s movements so you can move out of the way quickly in case he moves to kick. Many horse owners and vets also claim that a trusting horse will be comforted by your hand too., It is safest to stand with your hip and shoulder near the horse's front legs. Since horses kick with their back legs, you want to stay as far away from them as possible., Since you need a hose and want to avoid being trampled, you'll want to clean your horse's sheath in an open area - perhaps in your barn. Don't stuff yourself and your horse in a small stable stall. You won't have anywhere to turn., Start from the belly and work towards its penis so that the horse isn't surprised. Use room temperature water, if possible. Hot water and cold water can be uncomfortable for your horse. Your goal here is to sluice off dirt and other contaminants from the outside of the sheath. Discard the used sponge after completion, Lubricate your hand and the sheath with either KY Jelly or a commercial sheath cleaner. In order to remove the smegma or “beans”, you’ll need to lubricate the region. This will also make the process less stressful/painful for the horse., Take a soft sponge or a pad of cotton wool and wipe gently along the outer edge of the horse's sheath. Remove all smegma, dirt, and any other foreign materials that may have built up. Use room temperature water to rinse, while wiping. Do not wipe too aggressively. Work the sponge or pad of cotton wool in small circles as you move along the sheath. , Push it as far as your can before inserting your hand. At most, your horse's sheath will slide 1 or 2 inches back. This will reduce the pocket that forms around the penis and will making cleaning easier. Not all horses will allow you do to it. If you do this frequently enough, your horse will become used to the sensation and won't resist., It will probably be a rusty color. This is normal. The smegma (dried excretions) will usually flake and peel away in your hand. Bring out as much as possible and use a lot of lukewarm water to rinse., Insert your little finger into the urethra and feel for a hard lump. If it is there, slowly roll it out of the tip of the horse’s penis. Some call this harvesting beans. You will feel it before you get to your first knuckle. Beans rarely form deeper than this and if they do, they require surgery to remove., Check for thick skin, grayish skin color in normally pink areas, and lesions. If you see any of these, you should consult your veterinarian. These can be the result of improper genital care, but may also be symptomatic of other dietary, bacterial, and viral issues., If you used soap, make sure it is all washed off. Left-over soap residue can cause problems of its own like skin irritation., You’ve just completed a gross job. Use a strong anti-bacterial soap and wash your hands and forearms several times. 

understand the pros.  understand the cons.  consult your veterinarian.  cut your nails.  put on thin latex gloves.  ask someone to help restrain your horse.  place your free hand gently on the horse’s back.  stand towards the front of the horse.  perform the cleaning in an open area.  use a soft sponge and hose to gently wet the sheath and penis.  use lubricant.  wipe away grime from the sheath.  gently push back the sheath with one hand.  remove smegma from around the penis with your other hand.  check for beans (lumps of smegma) in the urethra.  check for abnormalities.  use a sponge or hose to gently rinse the sheath and penis.  clean up. 

 This is one of the easiest ways of labeling hard surfaced objects. Label makers and label tape can be found at most general retailers and office supply stores. In all, you'll need:   Batteries (for label maker; optional) Label maker Label tape Scissors (optional), Your label maker may be a plug-in model, but if not you'll need to insert batteries into it first. After that, release the spool for the label tape, insert the tape, and fasten the spool back in place.Depending on your label maker, there may be many different spool configurations. Generally, this involves releasing a tab or removing the spool from a slot. If you have bought your label maker brand new, it may already come equipped with label tape, in which case you won't need to insert your own.  The way you input your label text into the label maker will also depend on your model of label maker. In most cases, this involves using a small keypad on the maker to input and confirm your label message.   Oftentimes, after you input and confirm your label message, the label will print directly. In some cases, however, you might need to select a "Print" option. Some label makers might also ask you to select a label size from a list of options. Choose the size that best suits the item you are labeling., Many label makers come equipped with sharp teeth where the label emerges. This makes it easy to tear your labels free. If your label maker lacks this feature, you may need to cut the label free with scissors. After that:   Take your label and hold it close to the item you are labeling. Peel the backing off the label to expose the adhesive beneath. Smooth the label onto the item's surface to prevent labels from pulling free and becoming a choking hazard. Use your nails or a hard edge to chase bubbles to the label's edges and remove them. If a label does not stick cleanly to the surface you are trying to put it on, you may need to make a new label and try again.  

gather your supplies.  prepare your label maker.  input the text for your label and print it.  apply the label to your children's items.

 Be warned, as the spider jumps and scales walls (But they cannot climb upside-down, so make sure to put overhangs on your walls). Instead of the regular approach, start with a running hit to knock it back.  You may take some damage from this. However, you also have the choice of another running hit followed by a critical.  Collect the experience and whatever item(s) it may drop, like string or spider eyes. You will be able to ferment the spider eye and use it in potion making, or eat it in an emergency. It will poison you for 4 seconds, but it won't make your health go lower than half a heart, and your health will regenerate if your hunger bar is full.  

let the spider come to you.  proceed to charge forward and continue left-clicking in the general direction of the spider.  look around to make sure there are no other mobs around. 

 Screenshot extensions are the most convenient way to screenshot web content, but if you need to take a screenshot of the Firefox window itself, you'll want to use the Windows shortcuts. This is also the quickest way to take a screenshot when you can't install extensions.  The screen will dim for a moment, and the screenshot will be created as a file in a folder called "Screenshots". The Screenshots folder can be found in your Pictures folder.    PrtScn may be labeled differently on your computer, such as "Print Screen", "Prnt Scrn", "Prt Sc", or other variations. It can usually be found between the ScrLk and the F12 keys. On a laptop, you may need to press Fn as well.  Pressing the PrtScn key will copy an image of everything currently displayed on your monitor to your clipboard. You can then paste this screenshot into a program like Paint or Word to save it as a file.   After taking the screenshot, open paint by pressing ⊞ Win and typing "paint". Press Ctrl+V to paste the copied screenshot into the blank Paint document. Save the file to save the screenshot to your computer.  If you just want to take a screenshot of your Firefox window, make sure it is active and press Alt+PrtScn. This will copy the image of the Firefox window to your clipboard, allowing you to paste it into Paint.  If you've saved your screenshot using the ⊞ Win+PrtScn command, right-click on the file and select "Edit". This will open it in Paint.

 While planks primarily target your abdominal muscles, they also increase the strength of the muscles in your arms and chest, which prepares you to do other strength-training exercises that target your arms specifically.To start a plank with a stability ball, kneel behind the ball. Make sure your knees are about hip-width apart. Place your palms together on the top of the ball with your arms fully extended. Roll the ball away from you until your forearms and elbows are resting on the top of the ball. Keep your legs straight so that your body forms a straight line from your shoulders down to your knees. Breathe deeply and hold the plank position for several seconds or breaths. Then pull with your abs to roll backwards from the ball and return to starting position. Do 10 to 15 repetitions of this exercise to complete one set. You can build two to three sets into your workout as necessary. You can increase the difficulty of this exercise by rising all the way to your toes rather than stopping at your knees. Reverse planks, in which you balance your feet on the ball rather than your elbows, are a slightly easier version.  Make sure you have mastered regular push-ups before you try doing them on a stability ball. Push-ups are a good overall bodyweight exercise that will strengthen your arms as well as the muscles in your back and chest. The further down your shins you hold the stability ball, the more difficult the exercise will be.From a face-down position, place the ball under your shins and extend your body in front of it with your hands on the floor. You may want to have a partner help you get into the starting position. Your hands should be a little more than shoulder-width apart. Slowly lift your body until your arms are straight. Then lower your chest, bending at the elbows. Control the movement both when you are pushing down and when you are raising up. Avoid simply letting gravity control your movement as you lower your body. If your shoulders are weak or you're recovering from a shoulder injury, then you should avoid doing push-ups.  The pike is a more difficult exercise that primarily targets your abdominal muscles, but also engages your arms and chest to a significant degree. Use this exercise if planks are no longer challenging, or if you want some variety.To start this exercise, lay face-down on the ball, with the ball under your stomach and your hands on the floor. Your arms should be extended straight below your shoulders with your legs together. Slowly walk forward with your hands until the ball is just under your thighs. Breathe deeply and tighten your abdominal muscles. Lift your hips up, keeping your knees straight, and roll the ball towards your hands in a slow, controlled motion. In the finishing position, you will be in a modified handstand with your arms straight and your head, shoulders, and back aimed toward the floor as though you are diving into a pool. Your body comes to a point at your hips, with your arms straight behind you and the stability ball under your ankles and the tops of your feet. To make the exercise safer and more accessible, reduce the range of motion on the hip lift so the final position looks like an upside down letter V. Slowly roll the ball out until your body is flat to return to the starting position. If you're new to this exercise, you may want to start with only 5 repetitions in a set, working up to 10 or more reps. Due to the danger of a head or neck injury, it's a good idea to have a spotter for this exercise, particularly if you've just started doing it.  

include planks to build strength for push-ups.  do push-ups on the stability ball.  advance your plank to a pike.

 Keep the affected area in particular clean and soft.Clean off soap completely from your body and scalp. Don't use abrasive soaps or harsh chemicals. Use moisturizers. Avoid harsh soaps and use a moisturizer. Use warm water — not hot.  This is one of the more difficult areas to clean and treat.If the skin of your eyelids becomes red or scaly then you can wash them nightly with baby shampoo. Use a cotton swab to wipe away scaly skin. Apply a warm compress to soothe the skin and wipe away scaly skin as well.  This is not quite the same as a full dandruff treatment, but it may help with light removal of skin particles from the hair itself.Apply a few drops of mineral oil or olive oil directly to your scalp. Leave the drops in for one hour. Comb or brush out your hair and wash it with warm water.  

wash your skin regularly.  clean your eyelids.  remove scaly skin from your hair. 

 Gently place this on your face and let it sit for one to two minutes. This will open your pores and prepare the skin on your face for exfoliation. Exfoliation is one of the most effective means to get rid of dead skin. Be careful that you use a warm and not scalding hot towel.; , After using the warm towel, the next step is to wash your face using a mild cleanser (such as Cetaphil) — the same as the one you likely already use on a daily basis as part of good skin care. Cleaning your skin can further help to open the pores and better prepare the skin on your face for effective exfoliation.   After washing, gently pat your skin with a dry towel. Be gentle and do not rub too vigorously, to avoid causing any damage to your skin. You may try standing in front of a fan to dry your body, especially hard to reach areas.  There are two types of exfoliation: physical, and chemical. Physical exfoliation is when you physically use a product that scrapes away dead skin cells by the pressure exerted upon them. Examples of tools for physical exfoliation include exfoliating pads and microdermabrasion kits.Skin-care professionals do not recommend microdermabrasion without the consultation of a doctor or dermatologist first, as you could damage or irritate your skin. Skin-care companies such as L'Oreal, Ponds, Clinique, and Neutrogena are now producing at-home microdermabrasion kits. These generally consist of an abrasive cream or scrub with a special tool for application.Sometimes they come with a microdermabrasion cloth with fibres that are rougher than normal and meant to remove dead skin cells.An example is Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion and Peel System., There is a variety of chemical exfoliating products available. Your best bet is to consult a professional in aesthetics or a dermatologist for advice in choosing the right product for you.If you are unable to afford a professional consultation, carefully read the labels of the products and choose one that is suited to your skin type.   After washing your face and gently drying it, carefully apply the chemical exfoliating product. Spread it all over your face, being sure to cover the full surface area. Gently massage the chemical exfoliating agent into your skin. Try delicate circular motions with your fingers. Do not rub too hard, as you do not want to damage your skin inadvertently. Many people exfoliate their neck as well. Some examples of chemical exfoliating agents include a glycolic acid peel or a lactic acid peel. The acidic nature of these peels is part of what makes them so effective. Chemical exfoliation tends to work better than physical exfoliation (in particular for long-term results) because it is able to access deeper layers of the skin. Chemical exfoliation works by breaking chemical bonds, which in turn releases dead skin cells and allows them to shed much more easily.  Then gently pat it dry. Leave it for about five minutes to air dry and then finish by applying a moisturizing lotion.   Moisturizing lotions are recommended as part of general skin care. They help to prevent early signs of aging and give your skin an overall healthy glow.  Basically, all areas of your body are okay to follow this same process of exfoliation (other than sensitive areas and mucous membranes); however, the most common area people use it for is the face and/or the neck. This is because these areas are most visible to the public, and often the highest cosmetic concern for people.   Look for exfoliating body scrubs that are made to work on the rest of your body and not your face.  Not all exfoliating solutions are products bought in a store. In fact, it's easy to make your own exfoliating creams, peels, and rubs at home, if you prefer a more natural approach. Below are two easy-to-use recipes:   Sugar and Oil Scrub: Combine equal parts brown sugar and any cooking oil (like olive oil, grapeseed oil, etc.) for a highly economical, highly effective skin scrub. Rub into the skin to exfoliate, then rinse with soap and water. Add a tablespoon of honey and a few drops of lemon for extra nutrients. Greek Yogurt and Papaya Enzyme Face Conditioning Mask: Mix 1/2 cup of Greek Yogurt and three tablespoons of mashed up papaya. Apply to face or body, and leave for 15 to 30 minutes. Peel off and rinse face when done. 

soak a towel in warm water.  wash your face with a gentle cleanser.  try physical exfoliation.  try chemical exfoliation.  wash your face with water after you are done exfoliating.  understand that you can also exfoliate other areas of your body.  try an all-natural solution using home ingredients. 

 Light plastic chairs will move around when you are cutting so securing the chair is vital to making this a success.  Weigh down the legs with bricks or rocks if your chairs have feet. You can also push the chair up against the wall to make sure it doesn’t tip over.       Weigh down the chair seat to keep the chair in place. If your chair doesn’t have feet you can also keep the chair in place by placing weight on the seat.  Any time your work with power tools you should make safety a priority. This includes wearing work gloves and keeping children and pets clear of the area.  One way you could approach this project is to create the same number of patterns as you have chairs and cut right through them instead of tracing or transferring.   Use heavy duty tape to adhere the pattern to the chair. The pressure from the handsaw could move the paper so it’s important you secure it.  While the pattern or design may be ultra cool, you want to make sure the chair is still functional. Consider how you will sit down in the chair after the design has been cut to ensure either the chair won’t break or be unusable.  Depending on the size of your design and chair you should size up what you will be cutting to match up the right blade.   Make sure your hand saw equipment is up to par. You don’t want to approach this project with a dull blade so make sure you are working with a sharp blade and a hand saw that works well.       Select a slow cutting speed. You may be excited about creating the design but a fast speed could make you more prone to errors.  Make sure you’ve fully punctured the plastic and you won’t be tearing or twisting the plastic chair to remove the cut out pieces.   Sand the cut out area if you see rough spots. Be careful when using sandpaper as you don't want to scratch the chair.        

secure the chair to the ground.  don’t forget about wearing protective gear such as eyewear.  consider leaving the pattern design on the chair and cut through it.  make sure the design won’t compromise how you sit in the chair.  choose the appropriate blade for the handsaw or jigsaw for cutting.  gently push cut out pieces through the chair. 

 Use a moderate sound and a smooth bow. With good ear training, perfect fifths are easy to hear, while out-of-tune fifths can be picked out by recognizing the dissonant vibrations and a sound that is not quite right., Adjust your D string until the A and D strings produce a perfect fifth.  Assuming your A string is in tune, press the D string near the nut to slightly sharpen the pitch, and adjust as needed. If a perfect fifth results from doing this, then the D string is flat. Likewise, if you need to press the A string near the nut to obtain a perfect fifth, then the D string is sharp.  As with tuning by harmonics, this relies on your ear to make sure that your strings are actually in tune - otherwise, the errors accumulate as you get lower.  A perfect fifth of the G and C strings may be a bit difficult to hear at first, especially if your strings are not high quality or if you are tuning in an orchestra with other cellos. Use harmonics if needed.  

play the a and d strings at the same time.  check if the d string is flat or sharp.  continue with the lower strings.

 Before you completely bail out on your bad date, be patient with them and cut them some slack. It could be that they’re nervous, just like you, or that they just don’t know what to talk about.Remember that first impressions aren’t always true. Give your date some time (and potentially more than one date) to get to know who they really are., Try to let yourself relax a little bit more into the date. It’s anxiety-provoking to meet someone new, so your nerves could be playing into your impression of how the date is going. Focus more on your date rather than your own inner dialogue, worries, or judgments. Listen closely to your date, or focus on the activity you’re doing together.This may help make the date better.  If your date is shy, he or she may have difficulty opening up to you on the date. Take the pressure off and get the conversation started, but avoid rambling about yourself. Instead, show your curiosity and interest in them. Ask them fun and unexpected questions or find things you have in common.Ask them questions they can't answer with a "yes" or "no," like:What's your family like? What's your biggest goal in life? What's your favorite place? Why?  , Your date may start talking about something that makes you uncomfortable or is inappropriate, like a past relationship or politics. Redirecting to a previous topic may be easier and more polite than starting a completely new conversation.You can say, "That's interesting, but I'm more curious about what you were saying earlier about your project at work. Tell me more about that."  , If your date doesn't get the hint, you may have to be more direct with them. You can be polite while still being clear that you're uncomfortable with whatever your date is saying or doing.   If your date is talking about something inappropriate and you want it to stop, you can say, "I'm sorry, but talking about sex makes me feel uncomfortable on a first date. How about we talk about your job instead?" If your date is doing something inappropriate, like drinking too much or being rude to the waiter, you can say, "I am feeling uncomfortable with how you just talked to the waiter. That's not okay. Please stop."  , Since you're on a date, naturally your date may try to talk about intimacy or may try to touch or hug you. Know what your limits are and stay in your comfort zone with intimacy. Physical touch may be inevitable on a first date and could bring you two closer together, but avoid anything you're uncomfortable with. Be direct when you need to if your date keeps trying to touch you.If your date is making you uncomfortable with touch, you might say, "I appreciate you wanting to hold my hand, but I'm feeling a little nervous. I'd like to talk more and get to know you a little better first."  , Remember that you two just met! It’s perfectly normal that you may be awkward around one another. In fact, acknowledging that it’s weird or that you’re nervous may help turn the bad date around.If you’re feeling like the date isn’t going like you hoped, chances are they are too, so speak up.   You can say, “I’m a little nervous right now, aren’t you? It’s so different talking to someone online and then meeting up in person.”  , Your date may try to impress you and sometimes this could lead to little white lies or bigger lies about who they are. Keep an eye out for any inconsistencies in what they say and call them out for it.You can be gentle and remind them that you just want to get to know who they really are.   You might say, "Hey, it's okay if you don't really speak Spanish. You don't have to impress me. I appreciate honesty."  , Changing the setting of your date or taking a break from the conversation may help to ease the tension of a difficult date. Some ways you can leave the date temporarily without leaving include:   Taking a short bathroom break. Texting a friend to get advice/tips to help. Suggesting doing something else fun or different from what was planned.  You don’t have to stay out on a difficult date forever. Take notice of any warning signs or red flags that this person is not someone you should be spending time with. There is no rule that says you have to stay out on a date just to be nice, particularly if the person is being rude, offensive to your beliefs, or aggressive. Some red flags to take note of include:Your date starts using terms of endearment for you after you just met. Your date says something sexually inappropriate or uses sexual innuendo. Your date makes inappropriate comments about your figure, race/ethnicity, or religion. Your date violates your physical boundaries or makes you uncomfortable.  Pay attention to your instincts once any red flags come up and/or if you just aren’t enjoying the date anymore. You may want to continue to give someone the benefit of the doubt, but take a moment to really listen to your feelings and evaluate if you can put up with your date anymore tonight or ever. Only you know who and what is best for you., If you’re really not interested in the other person, you won’t be able to fake your way through the rest of the date. Your date will notice that you’re not really listening to him/her. They likely won’t want to continue a relationship with you if you’re not interested, so just be genuine and honest with them.   You can say, “I’m just not feeling a spark with you. You seem like a really nice person, and I’ve enjoyed chatting with you over dinner, but I’m going to go home now. I’m sorry it didn’t work out.”  , Sometimes it may be too confrontational, uncomfortable, or dangerous to be overly direct about ending the date. Instead, keep it focused on you or something you need to do. Some excuses that might be useful include:"I'm sorry, I didn't realize how late it was getting. I need go home now. I have an early morning at work." "I'm sorry, I'm just not feeling that well. I think something I ate disagreed with me. I need to go home before I get sick on you." "I'm sorry, I just got a call from my best friend. I forgot she and I had plans later tonight. I need to go."  , When you leave your date, ensure you're own personal safety and that you don't get followed. You may want to let someone know the date has gone badly and make sure you have safe transportation home. For example, you can:Call or text a friend to let them know who you were with, when you're leaving, and when you expect to be home. Or ask them to come pick you up directly. Let the manager of the bar or restaurant you're at know what's going on. Ask them to call you a cab or walk you to the car. Ask them to distract your date if you need to leave undetected. Stay on the phone with someone as you leave until you're safely inside your home.  Make sure that your expectations of the person you’re trying to date are realistic. Honestly assess if you’re trying to connect and enjoy your dates, or if you automatically write them off as “not good enough” because of a bad cologne, being too short, or not having an interesting job. Let go of your expectations and give people more of a chance. Remember that everyone has value, you just have to find it., Try to stay positive and remember that with time and practice, you’ll start to find and enjoy better dates. Don’t give up. Keep dating and think of difficult dates as opportunities to work on your conversational and flirting skills.Rejection is a normal part of dating. Be happy that you were able to reject someone earlier rather than later and save yourself from a difficult relationship., Dinner dates or movies can be time-consuming. It's awkward to try to get out of those dates as they happen. So, actively try to plan shorter dates. You could try:   Meeting for coffee. Meeting on your lunch break.Meeting for frozen yogurt or dessert. Meeting at a dog park with your dog.  Remember why you’re going on dates in the first place to give yourself some motivation. It can be difficult to do if you’ve gone out on several difficult dates, but chances are you’re trying to date people because you want a healthy and fulfilling relationship with someone. Try to remember that and keep that in mind, even after you’ve gone on some difficult dates and aren’t having fun anymore. You can think about and write down:What you want from a relationship. What you want from a partner. Why dating and relationships are important to you.  If you find that you’re constantly going on the same type of date and not having success, reevaluate and add variety. For example, maybe most of your difficult dates have occurred when you’ve scheduled dinner, a movie, and drinks. Instead, add some variety to your dating experience and try doing something you find more fun or enjoyable. That way, if you don’t end up liking your date you’ll at least have a pleasant time on the date.Schedule activities that are time-limited, too, which will help keep the date from lasting forever if it’s difficult. You could try:   Going to a BYOB painting class. Taking a guided tour or hike. Going to your local zoo or aquarium.  Plan dates that are at safe locations where you feel comfortable. Never let a date pick you up from your home until you know them better. Get to know the owners or managers of where you typically go on dates. Have safe transportation lined up and always tell a friend who you're with and where you're going., Instead of forcing yourself to go on more dates that may end up being bad, take some time off from dating to spend time with people you enjoy. Schedule dates with friends and family you may not have spent time with in awhile. Being around people who support you will help you feel more comfortable and relaxed, even if your dating life isn’t going so well. It may even reenergize you to put yourself back out there to date again. 

be patient with your date.  let yourself relax.  ask open questions.  change the subject.  shut it down.  stay in your comfort zone.  acknowledge the awkwardness.  call out inconsistencies.  take a break.  take notice of red flags.  listen to your intuition.  be genuine.  make an excuse.  have a safe way out.  evaluate your expectations and patterns.  stay positive.  plan shorter dates.  reconnect with your purpose for dating.  add variety to your dates.  plan safely.  spend some time with people you like instead.

 You might examine the industry as a whole or an industry segment which targets a particular subset of the general market. For example, you could be investigating the petrochemical industry as a whole, or a narrower niche, like US petroleum refineries. In either case, you’ll need to identify the companies that offer services or products similar to those which your company offers.You might also need to conduct some cross-industry research. For example, a game developer may need to compile statistics on the console gaming market, PC gaming market, and handheld gaming market.; , Government databases contain huge volumes of statistical information on various economic sectors. Some of the best government sources in the United States for industry statistics include the Market and Industry Analysis Statistics published by the United States Census, the Department of the Treasury, FedStats.gov, EconomicIndicators.gov, and the Food and Drug Administration. All publish useful reports and statistics.   For other countries, consult federal databases and agencies within your nation, or conduct an internet search with keywords like “government statistics ” to locate relevant information.  At least two independent research reports with data on your market should be consulted. Contact private data-collection agencies or industry interest groups for a published report or market analysis relevant to your research.   You can also consult experts within your own company. Just bear in mind that their views may be biased or unreliable.  There may be more than one trade association for your industry. For instance, if you’re in the computer industry, you might consult or request recent industry-wide reports from the Computer & Communications Industry Association, the Association for Interactive Marketing, or the Information Systems Security Association. Whatever your industry, consult trade groups and industry publications to identify info which can provide background info on your industry analysis., Check academic databases such as Google Scholar for published studies on your area of interest. The Encyclopedia of Emerging Industries and the Encyclopedia of American Industries, both published by Gale Research, are also good sources., Make special note of annual revenues in the industry, number of involved companies, workforce statistics, etc. Find statistics about the size of the customer base and buying trends. Cross-check your information against other sources to ensure accuracy. Your industry analysis will be examined thoroughly when you present the final business proposal to investors or stockholders, so ensure your data is solid and sourced properly.  To do this, you’ll need to know the relevant market size. The relevant market size is the company’s potential sales if it were to capture the entirety of its market niche. For instance, if you’re selling electric cars, your relevant market size is not all automobile drivers, or all people in the world who travel distances which make driving desirable, but rather the total of all electric car sales in a given year.   Be sure to carefully analyze any underlying assumptions that your market analysis relies upon. This is particular important for a new product or a product that is undergoing rapid acceptance. Relevant market sizes should be calculated in both dollar amount and unit amount. In the foregoing example, the relevant market size might be $200 million per year, or 30,000 electric cars.  Ask important questions which will help you consider industry trends up through the present. You should consider the impacts of globalization and technological innovation in addition to the more obvious factors like competition from other companies and consumer preferences. Regulatory conditions and the state of the economy at the global, national, and local levels should also be taken into account. Other questions to think about include:   How has the market size changed in the past year? the past five years? the past ten years? What is the expected growth of the relevant market? What factors will affect market growth? Are new demographics affecting the market? Are demographics changing?  , If you’re going into or expanding a microchip production line, for instance, you’re going to need several million dollars in equipment and machinery. On top of that, you’ll need computer engineers and programmers to produce and design the chips. Other firms will be competing not only for your customers, but for your employees as well. All of these are things to consider when addressing barriers to entry.  Indicate their past business moves, their forthcoming products, and their marketing strategies. Include sourcing, manufacturing, and regulatory analyses. The company analysis should be as complete as possible; competitive advantages or disadvantages can arise from anywhere.   Does your competition engage in billboard, radio, TV, internet, or print ads? How many of each kind are effective? Address whether or not your company could meet or compete with their level of marketing. Think about recent innovations or mistakes the competition has made. Learn from their failures, and improve on their successes.  Using the framework you’ve built, with info regarding the competition, the barriers to expansion or implementation, industry trends, and availability of consumer attention, you can introduce how your company is positioned within the industry and compares with other companies. Include statistical information about your business and be honest about all the advantages and disadvantages that your firm faces.  Open with a paragraph about the industry’s history. Write one or two paragraphs about the size, products, and geographic scope of the industry, including both manufacturing centers and consumer centers. Next, introduce your own company’s position within the larger industry context, and foreground how industry trends make the implementation of your business proposal desirable.   Determine what lifecycle stage the industry is in. Is it:Emerging? (very new industry growing at less than 5% per year) Growing? (a state of steady growth a bit over 5% per year) Shaking out? (a state in which companies are merging or consolidating, and/or other companies are failing) Maturing? (growth is slowing to less than 5% per year) Declining? (a state in which there has been no growth for a prolonged period)    , Indicate expected growth in the industry, trends in products and technology, and factors influencing competition. Describe the competitive landscape in a general way. The rest of the business plan will elaborate on the state of the competition.   Healthy industries are high-growth and generally profitable, with a stable customer base and few barriers to entry. Industries that should be avoided are those that are declining, generally unprofitable, highly competitive and regulated, or difficult to enter., The analysis should describe who the major customer groups are and the unique properties of each. What is the age of your target customer? What is their race and ethnicity? Their needs and wants?   Put yourself in the customer’s place. Think about what they see and experience when they first hear about or encounter your product or service. Consider how they think about their choices. In addition to considering your current customer base, think about how you can expand your product or service to attract new customers or pull customers away from your competitors.  Lay the strategy out in greater detail in the rest of your business proposal. Include a detailed timeline and specific goals, like revenues and market share, that you hope to attain. Address marketing strategies, product development ideas, and workforce issues which could position your company for growth within the industry.   You could close with a call to action. A statement like “Given the current state of the market, it is advisable to implement the following business proposal” followed by a rough outline of your proposal can function as a smooth transition into the rest of the plan.  Pare the report down to an appropriate and manageable size. An industry analysis report typically runs two to three pages. Tweak the length of your report based on how it will be presented. If it is part of a business plan, it is better to keep the analysis short and to the point. If your report will be presented independently, you have more freedom to devote lots of space to raw data and detailed descriptions.  

define the scope of your analysis.  research your industry with independent government agencies.  compile independent research.  look at trade association data.  consult academic research.  compile relevant data using the sources above.  demonstrate there is an ample market for your business proposal.  consider industry trends.  think about barriers to entry or expansion.barriers might be in the form of market competition, but it could also manifest as a lack of money or talent, or as restrictive regulations and patents.  provide descriptions of the major competitors in the industry.use statistical information about their revenues, work force strengths, and products in detail.  situate your company within the industry.  begin your report with a broad description of the industry.  provide a market analysis.  describe customers’ outlook and demographic info.  use the analysis to prescribe a strategy for the near future.  edit the report. 

 Instead of asking questions every time your teacher finishes their sentence, limit them to one or two insightful and relevant questions. If you want, you can prepare these questions before class. They could be insights from last night’s homework, or general clarifying questions. By limiting your questions, you are allowing other students the opportunity to ask the teacher questions, as well.When the teacher announces something, wait a few seconds to see if others have the same question before you ask your question. If you have more questions, speak with your teacher after class or schedule a time to talk with your teacher instead of asking too many questions during class.; , Volunteering to help your teacher clean the chalkboard, pass out worksheets, or send a message to another class once in a while is fine. However, limit these opportunities to once or twice a week. Let other students volunteer their time to help the teacher with smaller tasks.Instead, volunteer for the tasks that you enjoy doing, and leave the other ones to other students. For example, if you like passing out worksheets, then just volunteer to pass out worksheets. Let other students clean the chalkboard, send messages, or take attendance.  Unless you have poor eyesight or poor hearing, it would not hurt to sit in the middle or the back of the classroom from time to time. Sure, sitting in the front of the class every day makes you look engaged and ready to learn, but you do not want to monopolize the front seats.By sitting in the middle or the back of the class, you are giving others the chance to sit in the front of the class. Remember that the teacher can see you no matter where you sit, and you can still be engaged even from the back of the classroom.  A lot of students get labeled “teacher’s pet” because they go out of their way to impress the teacher. They try their very hardest to please the teacher by bringing them gifts, complimenting them, or by taking their side versus the class’ side. These are not bad things to do, but try to limit your compliments and gifts to rare occasions.For example, only give your teacher gifts during holidays, or when it is their birthday. Compliment your teacher when they truly deserve it, for example, when you find their lesson particularly interesting.  

ask questions in moderation.  let others volunteer.  sit in a different spot.  don’t go out of your way. 

 Generics are often just as safe and effective as branded counterparts, often have identical ingredients list, and are sometimes even made by the same manufacturers. Further, any product that is regulated by the FDA or Consumer Product Safety Commission must meet the same standards, whether it is name brand or generic.   For instance, baby wipes - including generics - are regulated by the FDA, since they are intended for cleansing and moisturizing skin and are considered a cosmetic product.That said, many products - both branded and generic - commonly sold for babies do contain ingredients you should watch out for.  There are some products you should be especially wary of, whether branded or generic. In general, the products that you use regularly on your baby - such as lotion - should be free of potentially harmful ingredients. For instance, you want to avoid synthetic fragrances, parabens, and phenoxyethanol - some of which are even contained in brands that are markets as "natural".When possible, use chemical-free moisturizers. For instance, shea butter and olive oil can often be used to moisturize instead of artificial baby lotions.  The important thing to remember about baby oil is that is should never contain mineral oil. Unfortunately, both branded and generic options often do. Instead of using these options, simply use coconut or olive oil instead of baby oil., Cosmetics designed for babies frequently contain toxic chemicals that should be avoided. This is true for generic baby products as well as branded ones. While these products are not intended to be consumed, they can be absorbed through the skin.Products you should use sparingly include shampoo, wipes, lotions, bubble bath, and even baby oil. Use only enough soap to wash dirty areas. Use a washcloth with warm water and a bit of mild soap to wash the places where bacteria is likely present, such as the diaper region. Baby soaps generally have minimal additives, and are generally safe in small amounts. This is true both for generic and brand name baby soaps. However, the potentially carcinogenic chemical ingredient propylene glycol is somewhat common, and should be avoided in any product.  Consult your pediatrician before using any type of sunscreen on a baby that is younger than six months old.Beyond six months of age, sunscreen use is important to protect your child, though many sunscreens should not be considered reliable or safe. That said, generics are equally as safe as branded products as long as they meet certain criteria.In general, avoid spray sunscreens. These often do not provide great coverage, and risk being inhaled. Further, an SPF value over 50 is simply unnecessary. More specifically, oxybenzone and retinyl palmitate should be avoided. Oxybenzone is surprisingly common in sunscreens, both generic and branded.  If you're unsure of an particular product or ingredient's safety, don't hesitate to research it yourself online. The FDA's website is a great website to check, and can alert you if a certain product has been recalled.Additionally, the Environmental Working Group has compiled a database of cosmetics products and has rated them for toxicity and safety.   Use the EWG app to search specific products, including generics. Though it often recommends expensive options, the app is useful to check any product for especially dangerous ingredients., Other important criteria to help guide your safety considerations are country of origin and specific manufacturer. These are important because they reflect the regulatory standards the product had to meet. While these criteria alone cannot be considered sufficient to deem a product safe, products manufactured in North American or Europe likely had to meet strict regulatory protocols, whether they were branded or generic.Though people often associate branding with safety, a generic product from a country with a strong regulatory system can often be assumed to be equally safe.  

realize most generic products are comparable to name brand products.  beware of packaged baby lotions.  use coconut oil or olive oil instead of baby oil.  minimize your use of baby cosmetics.  select sunscreen carefully.  check products for safety online.  consider manufacturer and country of origin. 

 Though you can moonwalk in anything, even hiking boots, you should have as little traction as possible as a beginner. Wearing socks will make it much easier for you to practice your moves and to glide across the floor.          When you become a pro, you can even master this move with sneakers! That may seem impossible at first.; , Once again, smoothness is key, and while you can try it anywhere, it helps to be on a smooth, flat, non-stick surface, such as a hardwood floor or a smooth-tiled floor. Most dance floors will work, of course, but so will most kitchen floors. Stay away from rough or uneven surfaces or carpeted areas.          If you don't have any smooth surfaces in your home, then you're better off using shoes on a rough surface than socks. When you're an expert, you'll even be able to practice on a carpet.  Then, lift your right leg and place the toes of your right foot facing the floor, approximately a foot behind your left leg. Keep your arms at your sides -- you can worry about them later. Keep your left foot flat on the ground.  You can do this by increasing the width between your legs and feet until you feel stable. A good rule of thumb is to have them about 3-6 inches (the width of one of your feet) apart. As you get more comfortable with this move, you can do the moonwalk with your legs closer together. You can lift your arms a bit if that helps you keep your balance as you move backward.  Do this as you lean back on your right leg so that your left foot finishes behind the right leg. During this, the heel of your right foot should still remain in the air, with the toes pointed down on the floor. Put all of the weight into your lifted leg, so the leg that is flat on the floor feels weightless.  Now you are in the same position you started with, only your feet have changed positions. Your right foot should now be in front of your left leg instead of the other way around. To do the moonwalk correctly, only one of your feet should be in the air at any given time. Always one; never two, and never zero.  The moonwalk can really be mastered by perfecting these movements over and over, until it looks like you're really walking on the moon and when your feet are really moving back and back smoothly, without any kinks.  Add a head movement to help create the illusion of "moonwalking." As you slide your leg back, move your head forward as if it's being left behind in the movement. Then pull it back to the body as you switch to the other foot.          You can also swing your arms with every step, or hunch over your shoulders and grab your hat (if you're wearing one) like Michael Jackson did. You can use your whole body to show that you're walking on the moon, not just your feet.  

put on a pair of socks.  find a smooth surface.  place one foot directly in front of the other and stand on the toes of your back leg.  keep your balance.  slide your left heel back and "into" the floor.  snap the heel of your left foot up off the floor as you simultaneously snap the heel of your right foot down.  repeat the previous two steps, switching the roles of your left and right foot.  add some frills. 

  Take a A4 sheet of paper and fold it into 2 halves lengthwise. Take a ruler and measure 2.5 cm mark this as point A and then go down leave again 6.5 cm down and then draw a small, horizontal line of 2.5 cm and then connect the the 2 lines and fold along it.; ,  Draw a semicircle. Below the cap, draw a not so accurate semicircle taking the main crease as the diameter and mark the centre and then cut along the circle till the centre and then fold it backwards and forward.   Draw 2 parallel lines straight down from the face, 2 cm apart. Then cut along the lines.   Draw a vertical semicircle taking the main crease as the diameter. Mark the center and then cut along the curved line. Crease the body along the center fold.   Take a small piece of paper. Then fold the paper length-wise and then draw the half of the beard on paper and cut it fully. Then put it inside the card sticking it in line with the face (On the bottom). Then with the cotton, put glue on the beard and then stick the cotton spreading it (the cotton not the glue) covering the face . Make a slit opening at the mouth.  

make the cap.  mark the face.  cut out the body.  draw the body.  cut the beard. 

 The goal in Go Fish is to collect as many "books," or sets of four cards of the same rank, as possible. The person with the most books at the end of the game is the winner.   An example of a book would be having all four queens in a deck: the queen of hearts, the queen of spades, the queen of clubs, and the queen of diamonds. A book doesn't have to be composed of face cards. You could have a book of nines: the nine of hearts, the nine of spades, the nine of clubs, and the nine of diamonds.; , Players collect complete books by taking turns asking each other for a card they need to make a set of cards complete. For example, if a player is dealt a two of clubs and a two of hearts, she will ask another player if he has a two. In this way she adds cards to the book until it is complete.  If a player is asked for a card she has in her hand, she is obligated to hand over all cards of that rank. If she does not have the card, she replies, "Go fish." The player who requested the card then "fishes" a card from the pile of extra cards called the "draw pile." This gives her an extra chance to obtain a card for one of the books she is building.   If a player receives the card she asked for or draws it from the pile, she gets another turn. If a player doesn't end up with the card she asked for, her turn is over.  Players continue to go around the circle, asking for cards, drawing cards and creating books, until either someone has no cards left in his or her hands or the draw pile runs out. The person with the most books is the winner.  

know the objective.  know how to build a book.  know what it means to "fish.",  understand how the game ends. 

 Pacing usually comes as the expression of anxiety and/or restlessness. The best way to alleviate such distress is to foster both regular physical activity and mental stimulation. Fortunately, these activities often go hand-in-hand.You might try to:  Walk your cat on a leash. Play with your cat for 30 minutes per day. Provide cat trees, paper bags, or cardboard boxes for your cat to explore.  Sometimes cats just need a friend. Bringing a new, younger dog or cat into your household could provide the stimulation your cat needs to end their pacing at night.If the new pet is another cat, you’ll want the new cat to be:Younger. Smaller. The opposite gender. Fixed.  Give your cat something fun to watch. Put birdbaths and/or bird feeders outside your window, so that your cat can get a good view. This version of “kitty TV” entertains your cat and provides excellent mental stimulation, which can help alleviate pacing at night. 

encourage physical activity.  introduce a companion.  provide visual stimulation. 

 Whether you're standing up in front of a crowd or talking one-on-one to a person, you need a set speech for how you're going to ask people for money. Even though you are memorizing a speech, you should remember that you're talking to real people who want to hear from you and what you think.Keep it short and to the point. Focus on giving information about your organization and what you need from the person. For example, something like, "Hi, I'm John from the Sunshine Organization. Our mission is to help families in need. For instance, we've helped families who've been hit hard by the downturn in the economy and find themselves without a place to stay. We provide cheap or free temporary housing to these families based on their needs. Currently, we're in need of new mattresses, as ours are not holding up anymore. We could really use your help in the form of a donation. Your donation would mean so much to these families." Don't forget to practice. Like anything you do for the first time, it can help to practice your spiel first. Try saying it in the mirror first, getting your timing and delivery right. Next, try practicing on a friend or family member to see if they have any suggestions for improvement.; , When you're asking for donations, you need to figure out who your target audience is. Sometimes, it's a single person, while other times it's a group of people or an organization. Basically, you need to know your audience so your can target your message to that audience.Knowing your audience includes doing research about them. For instance, say you want to talk to the small business association. You'd have to call the leader of the organization to set up a time to talk to them. After that, you'd need to look up the company and executive profiles for the people involved. If possible, you should find out what causes they've donated to in the past. You can use what you learn to tailor your speech to that audience.If you know the group of business men has supported similar organizations in the past, for instance, you can use that information. Help them to see how your organization is similar to the places they've donated to in the past and also deserving of information.  When asking for donations, people want to know what their money is going towards. They want it to help people, not necessarily to go to paying a huge amount of administrative costs. Therefore, people feel more comfortable if you can offer a breakdown of what your money is going to.You don't have to break it down into details like money spent on pencils and pens. Just broad categories will do, such as "Services," "Administrative Costs," and "Building Costs," for instance. It also helps to follow up later to say exactly how the money was used through a later or email., Desperation can work in the short-term, if you really do need a one-time large donation for something huge. However, when organizations constantly shout out desperation, it can be wearing on donors. Try to keep it more professional, and you'll be more likely to draw donors in.For example, over-exaggerating your need time after time can make you look bad. If you're constantly saying, "We need your donation, or we may need to close our doors forever," that looks desperate, even if it's true. It's better to say something like, "Your donation makes such a crucial difference to the families we serve."  , People generally don't respond to abstractions. A concrete goal can help you win over people to donate to your cause. For instance, if you need to fix your roof or gain enough money to sustain a program, ask for donations with that specific goal on the table.For example, if you need to raise money to fix your roof, you could say something like "We need your help to reach our goal of $15,000. Our roof is in bad need of repair, and once you help us reach that goal, we can fix our roof and continue services to those in need."  , That is, most companies and many people appreciate some sort of public acknowledgement of their funds. If you tell them upfront how you will show appreciation to donors, it can help encourage them to donate.You can also mention donations being tax deductible. Even though most people are aware of this fact, you should emphasize that your cause is one that qualifies them for a tax deduction.  If you take your donors for granted, they may want to leave. Everyone wants to feel appreciated sometimes. Things like thank-you notes, small gatherings, and in-person visits can make donors feel appreciated.In addition, donors who feel appreciated may be more willing to solicit donations on your behalf without you even asking.  

create a spiel.  know your audience.  be upfront.  skip the desperation.  make it concrete.  tell them what they get in return.  appreciate the donors you have. 

 Seek medical attention if the injury involves protruding bones, deep cuts or lacerations, numbness, or if large areas of skin have been removed. In the worst cases, some parts of skin or even the finger or toe may have been partly or entirely cut off. If this happens, put the appendage on ice and take it with you to the emergency care facility., Apply pressure to the area using a sterile dressing or clean cloth until the bleeding stops. If the bleeding does not stop after five to 10 minutes of constant pressure, seek medical attention.  If available, use Telfa bandages, which do not leave fibers in the wounds or impede clotting and are best.  Use fresh water, sterile dressing pads, or clean cloths. Wash your hands before you begin if you have time. Clean out any dirt or debris that may be located in the wound. Touching a fresh wound can be painful, but cleaning it thoroughly and carefully is important in order to prevent infection.  Clean the area surrounding the wound, using sterile dressings dampened with saline or clean water. Wipe away from, not toward or into, the injury in all directions.  After the bleeding has stopped and the area has been cleaned, it is easier to see damage that was not clear at first, such as visible bone or bone fragments. Most injuries that occur to fingers and toes can be managed at home by using proper methods of cleaning, bandaging, and monitoring the injured area., For deep cuts and lacerations, stitches may be needed. Apply a butterfly band-aid, if available, to pull together the split areas of the skin until you can get to a medical facility. Use several butterfly band-aids for larger areas. This will help to prevent infection, control the bleeding, and help the doctor to assess the area for stitches.  If butterfly band-aids are not readily available, use regular band-aids and pull the skin together as tightly as possible. Avoid placing the adhesive part of the band-aid directly on the wound.  Symptoms of a broken bone can include pain, swelling, stiffness, bruising, deformity, and difficulty moving the finger or toe. Experiencing pain when putting pressure on the area or trying to walk can mean a bone has been fractured., In many cases, even broken bones and sprains can be managed at home. However, if the area looks deformed, is cold, pale, or without a pulse, this indicates the broken parts of the bone have separated from each other. Prompt medical attention is needed to realign the separated sections of bone., Broken bones involving the big toe are harder to treat at home. Bone fragments can become dislodged, damage to ligaments or tendons may have occurred during the injury, and risks of infection and arthritis may be greater if the area does not heal properly. Consider seeking medical help if the big toe appears to be broken.Buddy taping the injured toe to to its neighbor with a turn or two of medical tape will help support the broken toe while you go to the hospital.  Avoid applying ice directly to the skin. Ice can be placed in a baggie, then wrapped in a small towel or other material. Some finger and toe injuries do not involve cuts, scrapes, bleeding, or any areas of broken skin. The finger or toe may be sprained, or one of the bones may be broken, yet the skin is still intact. Apply the ice for 10 minutes at a time.  For minor cuts and scrapes, the purpose of the bandage is to prevent infection and promote healing. For more serious injuries, the bandage can help to prevent infection and provide protection for the injury while it heals., A finger or a toe injury can involve damage to the skin, the nail, the nail bed, sprained ligaments and tendons, or broken bones. For injuries that only need protection from infection, simple dressings and regular band-aids will work fine., If the skin is broken, then properly dressing the area will prevent infection and control further bleeding. Use sterile pads, sterile gauze (Telfa works best), or very clean materials to cover the entire wound. Try not to touch the sterile part of the dressing that will be directly in contact with the wound., The risk of infection is increased with injuries that involve cuts, scrapes, or torn areas of the skin. Applying the antibiotic cream or ointment directly to the dressing is a good way to help prevent infection without directly touching the wound., Bandages are to be applied not too tightly, but tight enough to keep the dressing in place. Bandages that are too tight can interfere with blood flow., Be sure to cut or secure any loose ends from dressing material, bandages, or tape. This can cause pain, and possibly further damage, if the loose ends get caught or snagged on something., Unless the tip is part of the injury, leaving it exposed helps to watch for changes that might indicate problems in circulation. Plus, if medical attention is needed, leaving the ends of fingers and toes exposed helps doctors to evaluate for nerve damage., The fingers and toes can present challenges when they need to be bandaged. Gather materials that are larger than the area, so you can cut the large gauze, sterile dressing pads, and medical tape, in sizes suited to the area., Cutting the material this way helps to securely cover the tips of the injured finger or toe. The cut pieces should be designed to be twice the length of the finger or toe. Apply the bandage along the length of the finger or toe first, then down the other side. Wrap the other ends around the area., Use additional pieces of tape as need to secure the bandage in place. Also take care to cover all areas of broken skin with dressing materials, before applying the final bandage, in order to prevent infection., The bandage you apply may need to provide protection, prevent infection, promote healing, act like a splint, and prevent further damage to the injured area. , A splint helps to immobilize the injury and prevent further, accidental injury. Select a splint that is the proper size for the injured digit. In some cases, a regular popsicle stick can be used as a splint.Try to immobilize the joint above and below the injury site with the splint. If the injury is to the first joint of the finger, this means try to immobilize the wrist and joints above the injury. This keeps the surrounding muscles and tendons from straining the injury or becoming damaged themselves.  Carefully folded pieces of dressing material can be used between the injured digit and the splint to provide some cushion and prevent irritation., Use medical or paper tape to secure the splint, taking care not to wrap the area too tightly. Apply the medical or paper tape lengthwise first, with the digit on one side and the splint on the other, then wrap around the injured digit and the splint to keep it in place. Take caution not to wrap the area too tightly, but tight enough so the splint does not slide off., An adjacent finger or toe works just as well as a splint in most cases. Buddy taping helps to prevent free movement of the injured digit to allow the area to heal properly.Most commonly, fingers and toes 1 and 2, or 3 and 4, are paired or taped together. Always place small sections of gauze between the digits being paired to prevent irritation., Cut or tear 2 sections of non-stretch, white, medical tape. Wrap each piece around the areas just above and below the injured joint or break in the bone, including the buddy digit in the wrapping. Be careful to wrap securely but not too tightly., Once the digits are anchored to each other, proceed with wrapping additional sections of tape around both digits to secure them to each other. This method allows for the digits to bend together, but side to side movement will be restricted., In some cases, blood can accumulate under the nail of the injured finger or toe, and can cause unwanted, added pressure and possible further damage to the injury. A medical procedure can be done to relieve the pressure., Even minor cuts or scrapes may require a tetanus booster shot to prevent serious infections. Adults should get a tetanus booster every 5 to 10 years., Developing a fever, chills, sudden numbness or tingling, or a sudden increase in pain or swelling warrants seeking medical help sooner, rather than later., It usually takes about 8 weeks for a broken bone to heal. Sprains and joint injuries may heal more quickly. If problems linger, see a doctor. If symptoms get worse, such as pain and swelling, beyond the first 2 to 3 days, medical attention may be warranted. 

determine the severity of the injury.  stop the bleeding.  clean the injured area thoroughly.  decide if the injury can be treated and bandaged at home.  use a butterfly band-aid.  determine if a bone is broken.  manage broken bones or sprains at home.  treat a broken big toe.  apply ice to prevent swelling, reduce bruising, and reduce the pain.  select a bandage that fits the injury.  use basic dressings to prevent infection.  dress the wound with sterile material.  use antibiotic creams as a part of the dressing.  secure the dressing in place with a bandage.  avoid loose ends from the bandage.  leave the tip of the finger or toe exposed.  tailor your bandage to properly cover the tip if it is injured.  cut the bandage into a “t shape”, “x shape”, or “crisscross” shape.  take caution not to wrap the area too tightly.  provide support for a sprain or broken bone.  use a splint for sprains or broken bones.  place gauze or folded dressing pads along the area for cushion.  secure the splint in place.  bandage the area using buddy taping.  start by applying tape above and below the injury.  wrap additional sections of tape.  watch for blood under the nail.  keep up with your tetanus boosters.  watch for new symptoms.  allow time to heal.

 There are thousands of grape varieties in the world. For the greatest success in growing grapes, choose the variety that will work best for you. Do some research on grape varieties, while keeping the following in mind:Your reasons for growing grapes. You may want to eat the fruit, make jam, make wine, or just add the beauty of grapevines to your yard. Find out which varieties are best for your intended purpose. Your climate conditions. Different varieties of grapes are better suited to certain geographic areas and climate conditions. Learn about grapes that are known to perform well in your area. Natural variation among grapes grown from seed. There are some genetic differences even among grapes of the same type, so the grapes you grow may not turn out exactly the way you expect. Go into your project with an open mind, and be prepared to experiment.; , Once you identify the variety of grapes you want to grow, get your seeds. You can get them from grapes you've purchased, from a nursery, from your yard's wild grapevines (in some areas), or from another gardener.  Examine the seeds to make sure they are healthy and in good condition. Squeeze the seed gently between two fingers. A healthy seed is firm to the touch.Look at the seed's color. In a healthy grape seed, you will be able to see a pale gray or white endosperm under the seed coat. Put them in water. Healthy, viable seeds will sink when placed in water. Discard any seeds that float.  Take the viable seeds and wash them thoroughly to remove any pulp or other matter. Soak them in a small amount of distilled water for up to 24 hours., Many seeds require a period of cold, moist conditions to begin the germination process. In nature, this is achieved when seeds sit in the ground over the winter. You can mimic these conditions through the process of stratification. For grape seeds, the best time to begin stratification is in December (the northern hemisphere winter).Prepare a bed for your seeds. Fill an airtight bag or other capsule with a soft medium like wet paper towels or sand, vermiculite or peat moss that has been dampened. Peat moss is the best choice for grape seeds because its anti-fungal properties will help eliminate seed-damaging mold. Tuck the seeds into the bed. Cover them with about 1/2" (1.25 cm) of growing medium. Refrigerate the seeds. The ideal temperature for stratification is a steady 35-40 ºF (1-3 ºC), so the refrigerator is a good place for this process. Keep the seeds refrigerated for two to three months. Do not allow them to freeze.  In early spring, remove the seeds from the refrigerator and plant them in pots filled with good soil. Plant seeds individually in small pots, or in larger pots with at least 1 1/2" (3.8 cm) between them.Make sure your seeds stay warm enough. To properly germinate, the seeds need daytime temperatures of at least 70ºF (20ºC) and nighttime temperatures around 60ºF (15ºC). Use a greenhouse or warming mats to keep your seeds at the correct temperature. Keep the soil moist but not too wet. Mist the surface with a fine spray of water when it starts to look dry. Check for growth. Grape seeds typically take between 2-8 weeks to sprout.  When your seedlings have grown to about 3" (8 cm), transplant them to 4" (10 cm) pots. For the healthiest plants, keep your seedlings indoors or in a greenhouse until they have reached a height of 12" (30 cm), have a good network of roots and have at least 5-6 leaves.  To thrive, grapevines need the right amount of sun, proper drainage and a form of support.Choose a sunny spot. Grapes need 7-8 hours of full sun daily for best results. Make sure you have plenty of space. Space your plants about 8' (2.5 m) apart to allow for growth.  Grapes require well drained soil. If you have clay or other poorly drained soil, augment it with decomposed compost, sand or other soil amendments to increase drainage. Alternatively, use a raised bed filled with a good sandy loam mixed with compost.   Check the pH of your soil before planting your grapes. Different types of grapes thrive best with different soil pH levels (5.5-6.0 for natives, 6.0-6.5 for hybrids, and 6.5-7.0 for vinifera), so it is best to either plant in an area with a pH level in the right range, or adjust your soil’s pH before planting.If you are planning to grow grapes for wine, be aware that different types of soil (e.g., sandy, silty, rich in limestone, or rich in clay) will affect the flavor of the wine., Two weeks after planting, add a small amount of 10-10-10 fertilizer to the soil around the base of your young plants.Repeat this process once per year every spring after that., Grapevines need a trellis or arbor for proper support. The first year in the vineyard (2 years after starting from seed), when your plants are still small, stakes will be sufficient to support them and keep them off the ground. As they grow, you will need to train them to the trellis or arbor. Tie the tip of the shoots to the wire, and allow it to grow along the wire., Grapevines take up to three years to start producing fruit. During that time, proper care and training of your plants is essential for the best fruit yield.Year One: Watch for growth. Choose the strongest three shoots on the plant and allow those to grow. Pinch off all others. The three remaining shoots will grow stronger and more vigorous. Year Two: Fertilize using a balance fertilizer. Remove flower clusters as they emerge; allowing the vine to fruit this early will deplete its energy. Remove any buds or shoots that grow below the three main ones you selected the prior year. Prune properly. Loosely tie long shoots to the arbor or trellis. Year Three: Continue fertilizing and removing low buds and shoots. During this year, you can allow a few flower clusters to remain and produce a small crop of grapes. Year Four and Later: Continue fertilizing and pruning. This year and thereafter, you can let all the flower clusters fruit if you wish. As you prune, be aware that grapes will fruit on one-year-old wood (i.e., wood that grew during the previous season).  

choose the right variety.  obtain the grape seeds.  ensure the seeds are viable.  prepare the seeds.  stratify your seeds.  plant your seeds.  transplant your seedlings.  select a good location for your grapevines.  prepare your soil before planting.  fertilize your grapes after planting.  properly support your grapes.  take proper care of your plants, and prepare to wait. 

 Look it over for any small pinfeathers that may have been left behind when the turkey was plucked, and remove them.       ; , Under your turkey's tail, you will see an empty cavity. You'll eventually stuff this cavity with stuffing.          Remove the giblets (they are most likely inside of a paper package). The neck may also be inside the cavity; remove it as well. Set the giblets in a dish or resealable plastic bag and refrigerate them if you plan to make giblet gravy later. Otherwise, just discard them.  You can also put a platter on the bottom of the sink to help support the turkey while you rinse it.          Run some cool water over the outside of the turkey. Turn the turkey over and rinse out the cavity that you just emptied. Sometimes, the juices leak out of the giblet package and pool in the cavity. You don't want your stuffing to look bloody. Take your turkey out of the sink and put it on a work surface. Blot it dry with paper towels.  Make sure to cover both the outside of the turkey and the cavity with your seasonings.  Make sure that your stuffing uses only cooked ingredients including cooked vegetables, meat and seafood. If you use eggs, then you'll need to use pasteurized eggs.  Position your oven rack so that you can fit your stuffed turkey into the oven after it's prepared.  Fold the neck flap down, and lift the wings up and over the closed flap. The wings will hold the flap in place without requiring trussing.  Make sure that you don't pack stuffing into the cavity because it may not cook completely. , Stick a meat thermometer into the thickest part of your turkey breast.  The stuffing inside should be 165 F (74 C).  Place a tent of aluminum foil over the bird and allow it to rest for 20 minutes. , Carve it and serve it with the dish of stuffing.         

remove your turkey from its packaging.  take the giblets out of the cavity.  rinse the bird in a clean sink.  sprinkle your turkey liberally with salt and pepper.  prepare your stuffing recipe.  preheat your oven to 325 f (165 c).  stuff the neck cavity of your turkey with prepared stuffing.  fill the body cavity with stuffing.  tuck the turkey legs inside the skin flap for a neat appearance.  ,  place the turkey into your roasting pan.  cook the turkey until it reaches an internal temperature of 180 f (82 c) at the thickest part of the bird.  remove the turkey from the oven.  scoop the stuffing out of the turkey and into a clean bowl or dish.  ,  present your perfectly roasted turkey to your guests. 

 In this case the water heater shut off valve is the most common source of this problem.Verify the shut-off valve is completely open. For safety, each water heater includes a shut-off valve to use in case of emergencies. If the valve is shut even slightly, this can affect your water pressure.  The water pressure issue should be resolved when hot water is run through a faucet.   If the hot water low pressure problem is not resolved, it could be the water lines into the water heater or the appliance itself. In this case, call a plumber to troubleshoot further.  Blockages can occur within the lines, and plumbers have efficient ways of checking them.The appliance itself may also be causing a problem. A licensed plumber will need to evaluate it to see if it needs to be replaced. Working with water heaters can be dangerous, so it is best to leave this job to a professional.  

inspect the water heater if your low water pressure only affects your hot water.  test your water faucets again to see if the problem is resolved.  contact your plumber to check your lines into your water heater. 

 Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Divide your money and hide it in multiple places on your person. Ensure that you will still have cash on hand, even if you fall victim to pickpockets, by:   Separating your smallest bills into the wallet that you will use most frequently, since this will be on display the most often.Keeping larger bills in a more secure holder, like a money belt or a hidden pocket in your underwear or first layer of clothing. Hiding emergency funds in an unlikely container of little apparent value, like a mint tin or a box of feminine hygiene products.Carrying a change purse for coins, to be kept in a separate pocket from your wallet.; , Plan your day before heading out. Decide how much cash you will need to cover that outing, with perhaps a little extra to cover unforeseen expenses. Whether you’re taking cash from a larger money roll that you keep with you, or withdrawing money from an ATM for each outing, don’t bring more than you expect to spend.Use your plan for the day to decide how to divide and store your money on you, as well as which denominations to carry, if possible. For example, say you plan on traveling by both bus and taxi throughout the day, with a stop at a crowded market for shopping, and dinner at a fancy restaurant afterward. In that case, consider keeping coins for your bus fare in your change purse, small bills for taxi fare in your wallet, and large bills for shopping and dinner in your money belt.  Avoid using your back pockets.Keep your wallet, change purse, and any other holders front and center, where you are more likely to spot thieving hands. If the only other option is the side pockets to your pants, use those. Otherwise, favor:The inside pockets of your jacket or coat, preferably with your jacket/coat zipped or buttoned up for double protection. Pockets that can be closed with zippers, straps, buttons, ties, or, even better, a combination of them for extra security. “Smart” pockets sewn into the front of specially designed underwear, shirts, or other clothing worn close to the skin.Wallet chains for any money holders that you keep in easily accessible pockets.  Whenever possible, refrain from counting it where others can see. When you divide and hide your money before heading out, memorize how much you have where. Keep a mental tally from then to minimize the need to recount what you have left as you spend it. Additionally:Fight the urge to touch your money holders in order to double-check that it’s still there. This may seem counter-intuitive, but continually touching your hidden wallet will show prying eyes exactly where to find it. Use private moments like bathroom breaks to get money ready for your next transaction. For instance, if you just had lunch before heading to a museum with an entrance fee, transfer money from your money belt to your wallet now so you don’t draw attention to your belt later. Check yourself out in the mirror before going out. Look for any obvious bumps through your clothing that might betray where your money is held. Do what you can to minimize or hide these, like using a thinner billfold or draping a scarf over your clothes to obscure it., Contact your bank and credit card companies before you go traveling. Inform them that you will be using your debit and/or credit cards in new location, just to make sure that your cards aren't denied when you use them yourself. Additionally:Also ask them how to report a stolen or lost card from that location, since their contact information in one area may differ from another. Sign up for text and/or email alerts for your debit and credit cards. This way you’ll be notified about each purchase made with them, which is a good idea in case they're stolen without you realizing it.  Remember: don't keep your all eggs in one basket. Hold your credit cards in a more secure holder (like your money belt or a separate wallet held close to you), rather than the wallet that you use the most often to handle small bills. Store your bank and credit card companies' contact information separately from the cards themselves. Ensure that you can report stolen cards as soon as possible.   If you expect to use plastic frequently, consider using store-bought pre-paid debit cards instead of your personal accounts. Keep these in the wallet that will be on display the most often, and your personal cards in a more secure holder. This will help minimize your loss if your wallet is stolen. With personal cards, choose only one or two to bring with you. This will also reduce your losses in the event of theft. This could apply to each outing or even the whole trip itself.  

store money in different places.  only carry as much as you need.  hold money where you can see it.  avoid drawing attention to your cash.  take precautionary steps with plastic.  keep loose cash, plastic, and contact info separate from each other. 

 If you have any spare toilet paper rolls laying around, you can turn them into a fun, wiggly snake using a bit of paint and string. Here's a list of what you will need:   3 – 4 toilet paper rolls Acrylic or tempera paint Paintbrushes Scissors Yarn Red paper or ribbon White school glue or tacky glue Markers, crayons, or googly eyes Hole punch  , If you cannot find that many toilet paper rolls, you can use some paper towel rolls instead.  If you are using paper towel rolls, cut them into thirds.  You can paint them all one color. You can also paint each roll a different color. If you want to add patterns and designs, wait for the paint to dry first.  You don't want them to get mixed up with the body of the snake.  There will be two holes on the top, and two holes on the bottom. The holes need to be straight across from each other. Make sure that the top and bottom holes on each side are aligned.  The holes need to be straight across from each other. , Don't tie the yarn too tight, or the snake won't be able to wiggle. There should be a gap between each piece. Try to hide the knot inside the snake.  Cut a long, skinny rectangle from a piece of red paper and cut a V shape into on end. You can also use a piece of red ribbon. Glue the flat end inside the snake's head. Make sure that it is in the middle of the mouth.   If you want your snake to have a closed mouth, ask an adult to staple the end of the roll shut, right over the tongue.  You can draw the eyes on using a crayon or marker. You can also paint them on. If you have any googly eyes at home, you can glue them on using white school glue or tacky glue. 

gather your supplies.  gather three to four toilet paper rolls.  use scissors to cut each toilet paper roll in half.  paint the toilet paper rolls and let them dry.  choose two rolls to be your head and tail tip and set them aside.  punch four holes in each body piece.  punch two holes into the head and tail tip piece.  cut some yarn into 5 inch (12.7 centimeters) long pieces.you will need enough pieces to tie the rolls together.  ,  tie the pieces together using the yarn.  add the tongue.  add the eyes. 

 Add multiple pause events along the timeline of the video, and set them to short durations to slow down the video. Choose the areas where you add the pauses to mainly be empty or silent areas of the video, for example between sentences. This can be useful to allow the viewer time to read and view other instructional or informational content you added to your video using the other types of events.  In cases where you need to give the viewer a warning about the following content in the video. For example, to warn the viewer of spoilers coming ahead, or when the following content contains violent scenes that should not be watched by children. In such cases you can add a pause event and set its duration to 0 so that it will pause the video indefinitely. You can then add a text event containing your warning. You should make sure the start time of the text event is the same as; or before the start time of the pause event.  In cases where you want to give the user a choice of continuing or jumping to another video. For example, if you're creating a series of instructional videos on a certain topic and the series is incremental in level (each episode/lesson targets a more advanced topic than the one before). It might be useful if, after the first few seconds of each video, you add a pause and display a popup event that asks the viewer whether they want to skip to the next lesson, episode. The popup itself should be a link to the next video. If the viewer decides he/she wants to continue this video, they just wait for the 2 or 3 seconds pause duration.  If you are creating an instructional video that requires the viewer to repeat a certain action a set amount of times. Here's an example:  Sports and exercises instructional videos. Especially ones created as a "do-while-you-watch" video. In such cases, shoot the action once. Then, in Popcorn, add a loop event spanning the interval of the action and set the number of loops to the desired number of times. You should however, say something about how many times the action should be repeated before the loop begins. You can also add a text event at the end of the loop saying that this action should be repeated X times.   If you're creating a video that includes a twist at the end of a certain scene and you're not sure everyone watching will get that twist the first time. For example, a kid doing something totally unexpected while playing with his parents that takes a very short time. In such cases, you can add a text event right after the twist happens saying something in the lines of "let's see that again, this time, concentrate on the child in the right corner1". You then add a loop event spanning the whole event.  For example, if your video contains violent scenes, you can provide viewer with two links, one for children, where you add a skip event spanning the violent scene, and one for adults that doesn't include the skip event. Another case is when the video contains spoilers that you want to remove.  

use the pause event in the following case:  you want to slow down the video.  use the loop event in the following cases:  if you are creating a mash-up (especially a funny one) of an already existing video, loop events can create a funny repetition effect if set to short durations/intervals.  use the skip event in the following cases:  you want to completely remove a specific interval from your video. 

 It's significantly easier to wake up early if you've slept well the night before. Eating a lot late at night, though, can make sleep difficult because food takes time to digest. Spicy, garlic-flavored and highly acidic and fatty foods are especially troublesome because they frequently cause heartburn if you lie down too soon after eating them.Conversely, hunger can also disrupt sleep. So if you find yourself really hungry before bed, stick to snacking on things like oatmeal, bananas, cereal and milk, yogurt, raw veggies or some popcorn., One of the reasons so many people hate waking up early is because of that rushed feeling they have when trying to hurriedly get ready and out the door on time. To help avoid some of this, choose and lay out your clothes the night before, prepare your lunch, pack up your homework and books in your satchel or book bag and make sure you have any forms signed that you need for school.   Lay out your clothes, shoes and accessories where you will put them on – whether that be in the bathroom after you shower or in your bedroom. Have your backpack, gym clothes and musical instrument, if you have one, by the door, ready to go.  Continue with your returning-to-school schedule and eat a hearty breakfast. It will increase your glucose level, get your juices flowing and set a good tone for the rest of your day.  Most of us have done it, probably more times in a row than we’d care to admit. But hitting snooze only makes getting up harder and your mornings ultimately more rushed. So move your alarm – further than arm’s reach.   If you have an extremely hard time waking up, consider putting it across the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off., Purchase and then put more than one alarm clock in different places around your room. You might set them to go off at the same time, or you might opt to have them go off at different times, but no more than 2-3 minutes apart. Otherwise, you’re apt to get back in bed after turning off the first.   Buy different types of alarms, so the buzzers sound differently and have different volume levels. You could also use your cell phone as long as it has an alarm and is loud enough. Some even allow you to download annoying alarm tones, which might be frustrating but ultimately effective.  Since your internal clock responds to light as its wake-up call, you can use it to help awaken yourself even if the sun has yet to rise. And there are some pretty neat gadgets out there that can help.   For example, there are a number of alarm clocks that help wake you up by slowly increasing light, as if the sun were rising, thus tricking your body to respond and say, “Okay, it’s time to get up.”Science has even demonstrated they do, indeed, help rouse people from sleep more easily and quickly, even though the light is artificial. There are also lamps you can put by your bed that slowly turn on, simulating the sunrise. Some even offer the opposite effect, simulating a sunset for help in going to sleep. Ultimately, however, natural light is the best way to go. It’s certainly what our ancestors relied on prior to Edison.Allowing natural light into your room by leaving the blinds or curtains open when you go to sleep is the best jolt to your rhythmic system. Yet because this is often not possible when getting up early enough for school, natural light simulators are nice alternatives.  

eat dinner 2-3 hours before bedtime.  prep for the next day.  eat a healthy breakfast.  make hitting snooze hard.  use more than one alarm.  utilize light to your waking advantage. 

 You can relieve the pressure on your bunions by wearing shoes that have a wide, flexible sole that supports your feet. There should also be enough room in the toe box, or the part surrounding the front of your foot, to fit the bunion without it rubbing against the shoe. Shoes like sandals, athletic shoes, and soft leather shoes are all ideal as they will provide support and space for your bunions.If you wear heels, you should try to keep your heels low, no higher than an inch off the ground. Your shoes should also have a sturdy heel counter so the heel of your shoes are snug and stay in place when you walk. Avoid narrow shoes or slip on shoes as they will not provide the support and space your need to walk comfortably with your bunions. If you have shoes that you find comfortable but cannot wear due to your bunions, you may be able to reshape them to make them less narrow using stretchers in the shoes. However, you should only do this if the shoes support your feet well.; , Do not believe the myth that your feet do not grow once you reach adulthood. In fact, your feet can get bigger and wider as the ligaments loosen and your arches flatten over time. When you are buying new shoes, you should ask a sales associate to make sure the shoes are not too narrow for your feet. They can measure your feet and help you find the right size so your new shoes do not agitate your bunion further.You can also make sure the shoes fit properly by walking around in them in the store to ensure they do not pinch or squeeze your toes. There should be ample room in the toe box or front area of the shoe for your bunions.  Orthotics can be placed inside your shoes to help realign the bones in your feet. They can also reduce the amount of pressure on your bunions, which can make your bunions less painful. You can buy orthotics over-the-counter at your local drugstore or pharmacy.You can also get prescription orthotics from your primary care doctor or from a podiatrist. Prescription orthotics are custom made for your feet so they will be fit your feet properly and provide the type of support you need. Keep in mind orthotics are usually a short term solution to bunions and feet pain. You may need to have your bunions surgically removed if they continue to be painful and make it difficult for you to walk.  

wear shoes that have a wide toe box.  buy shoes that fit your feet properly.  put orthotics in your shoes.

 Changing your client's workouts regularly helps them avoid hitting a progress plateau, and it will help them stay motivated. Introduce new physical activities every so often so that they have the challenge of trying something new. You might discover a type of exercise that they particularly enjoy. People will be much more motivated to exercise if it’s a fun outlet rather than a dreary chore.Even though two hours of cardio and an hour of free weights will probably get your client results, it’s also probably not sustainable. Make sure you help your client find an exercise routine that they can keep up. If they feel overwhelmed, they’re likely to quit altogether.  This has several benefits for both your client and yourself. If your client is struggling midway through a workout, you can remind them that their favorite exercise is coming up.Additionally, ending a workout on a positive, strong note is key. Your client probably won’t feel motivated if their last memory from a workout is crying midway through a set of push-ups. They’ll be much more encouraged to come back if they end their workout feeling great!  , If your client absolutely hates doing a certain exercise or working out a particular body part, motivate them by telling you those exercises will make the most difference. If they hate it because it’s so hard, they probably need to work on it! Don’t let them skip anything or only choose their favorite workouts.Take note of the things they really don’t like doing, and be extra encouraging during these.  

challenge your clients in different ways.  remember their favorite exercises and save them for last.  remind your clients that their “dreaded” exercises are making them the strongest. 

 The girl should stand about 2-3 feet away from her partner. The girl's body should be perpendicular to that of the guy's. The girl should hold the guys hand, in midair, gracefully. The partners should be looking at each other, so that they can maintain their presence, and concentration., The girl walks in front of the guy. First her left foot, and then her right. The girl's body should remain perpendicular to that of the guy's. Both partners should continue to hold each other's hands, and maintain eye contact., Both partners lock with each other's bodies. This first involves the girl moving her arm. She will unlock hands with the guy, and place her arm underneath the guy's shoulder, placing her hand on his back. The guy releases his hand from the girl, and places his arm around her back. Placing his hand underneath the girl's armpit., The guys arm should remain strong. The arm should remain straight as it rests on the girls back. Make sure it does not buckle. This arm is the pivot point of the ferris wheel. Try to tense your muscles so that you can create some extra strength. The girl's body will revolve around this arm., The guy should place his right arm behind the girl's right knee. The guy's right arm is what will create the momentum and the force that is used to swing the girl around. The guy will want to put almost his entire weight into the right arm, while keeping the left arm straight and locked., The girl swings up her left leg. The girl should keep both legs equidistant apart from one another. The kicking movement upwards should be smooth, and straight. This kick upwards is what will springboard the entire ferris wheel dance move., The guy maintains both his right and left hand positions. As the girl is swinging in the air, the guy holds his left arm straight and on her back. This will create a pivot point for the procedure. The guy will also maintain the right hand presence. This will keep your girl from falling as she is swinging in midair., Bend your knees as the girl comes down. When the girl comes down, the guy should bend his knees, as well as the girl. If you do not bend your knees, this could cause unforced pressure on your knees, and a potential injury.  Once both dancers are safely on the ground, with their knees bent, the girl and guy should both lift up their knees. You can take a bow, or lift up your hands. You can also go straight back to dancing or into another specialized dance move., At first, if you are practicing, do the move at a moderate speed. Remember, you need enough momentum to get the girl in the air. When you are in the air, you can take the swinging motion pretty slow. If you are dancing on the dance floor do the move pretty fast, which will amaze your audience, and look more professional.  

create space between the partners.  make the first move.  lock your bodies into place.  maintain the pivot point of the rotation.  create momentum for the big move.  begin the lift off.  hold steady as the dance move occurs.  use your knees as a brace.  spring upwards when the move is complete.  perform all of the steps very fast.

 One way to set the basis for a stylish outfit is to wear a basic, always in style outfit, such as jeans and a plain t-shirt. Other basic outfits include cutoff shorts, hoodies, and simple floral dresses. Then, add pieces to this to make it in line with current fashion trends.   Add a pair of heels, wedge sandals, boots, booties, or whatever shoe is stylish and hip right now. Basic pieces look great with everything. Blazers and cardigans are great pieces to match with basic outfits. Scarves are an easy way to look stylish. Add a patterned scarf to the basic outfit. Finish it off with the perfect handbags. Some celebrities and fashionistas spend more money and time on the perfect handbag than they do clothes. Make that basic jeans and t-shirt super stylish by carrying a hobo bag.; , Instead of starting with a basic outfit, go for a trendy garment. Try a wild print dress, a shirt in a bold color, or a style that is super chic but not necessarily your basic, everyday wear. Balance the garment out with basic accent pieces, like a solid cardigan or jacket, black pumps, or a small clutch.   The key to style is balance. Everything you wear should be tasteful and match. When you wear wilder pieces, that should be the focus of your outfit. Everything else should be basic and downplayed. You don't want to clash with the stylish piece or take the attention away from it.  You've been told you have great legs, you have a nice butt, or a great chest. Emphasize those assets! Use certain cuts, embellishments, and colors to emphasize certain body parts.   If you have great legs or a great butt, wear skinny jeans. Make sure your shirt doesn't cover up your butt. Try a dress or a skirt that lands above the knee if you have great legs. Wear low, tasteful necklines if you want to accentuate your chest. Wear sleeveless shirts and dresses if you want to show off your arms.  When wearing trendy pieces, go for this breakdown: 50% trendy, 50% staple. Or go 30% trendy, 70% staple. The key is not to overdo it.   When wearing a bold trendy dress, pair it with basic staples. Go for a neutral handbag and simple jewelry. For shoes, try sandals, booties, or pumps in neutral colors like black or tan.When wearing something like a trendy faux fur vest, pair it with skinny jeans, booties, and a plain long-sleeved top. Finish it off with a hat.  One great way to easily look stylish is to buy some jewelry that will go with everything. Buy pieces in solid colors so they'll match more outfits. Try stones and accents in colors that match most of the clothes in your wardrobe. Many of these staple pieces can be purchased at prices that won't break the bank.Try getting gold and silver necklaces, bracelets, rings, or earrings. Buy pieces that have black stones to match your black-based outfits. Wear pieces with brown stones to match earth-tones.  Nothing can add pizzazz to an outfit better than statement jewelry. No matter if you're wearing a simple neutral dress, a grey pant suit, or jeans and a t-shirt, bold necklaces and large cocktail rings can add style to any outfit.  

wear a basic outfit.  wear a trendy garment.  emphasize your best features.  balance trendy with staples.  buy a few staple jewelry pieces.  go for statement jewelry. 

 It doesn't do any good to learn words in German if you're not saying them right. Remember that Germans have a lot of tension in their cheeks when they speak. To sound like a German, you need to hold your mouth right.   When you open your mouth, shape it as if you are forming a large "o" or a lowercase "u."Try to find videos of people speaking German so you can understand how they keep their mouth when speaking. Germans also pronounce some consonants and vowels differently than English speakers would.; , Although German does share some things in common with English, some of the vowels are pronounced differently. This will be very important when you try to count in German.In German, the vowel combination of "ei" is pronounced like the "i" in "lie" or the "y" in "dry." For example, the word "drei" in German means three. However, it's pronounced "dry." Similarly, the word "frei" means free in German. It's pronounced "fry." It's the opposite for the vowel combination "ie." This combination is pronounced like the "ee" in the English word "free." So when you say the German word for four ("vier") remember to pronounce the "ie" in it as "ee." The vowel combination of "eu" is pronounced "oy" in German. If you see an umlaut over a vowel, you pronounce that vowel differently.The German word for "five" has an umlaut: fünf. The ü should sound like "ee" but with rounded lips.  One of the key ways that speaking German differs from English is how you pronounce some consonants. Some will be pronounced similarly to English, but not all.   The consonant "v" is pronounced as an "f" sound. So make an "f" sound, not a "v" sound, when you pronounce the German word for four.In German, the consonant "s" is pronounced as a "z" when it starts a word, such as "sieben" (the German word for seven). When the letter "r" ends a word, it's pronounced lightly, as in "uh." The letter "r" is also pronounced very lightly when it's in the middle of a word. Put your tongue on the roof of your mouth as you say it.So, the word in German for four "vier" is pronounced "feeah." When the consonant "z" starts a word, pronounce it as "ts."  , To pronounce "eins," say the word "eye" but pronounce the ending "nz." It's pretty easy to count to 10 in German now that you know how to pronounce some of the key consonants and vowels.  In German, "zwei" is pronounced as "tsvy." The "zw" is not pronounced as an English "z" would be, but rather is said as a "ts" sound.  Pronounce it as "dry," with the "r" pronounced guttural.  This word also has different consonant sounds than English. Pronounce "vier" like the English word "fear," but remember not to end with a hard "r." Say it more like "feeah."  , Say it like "foonf," and put a big accent on the "u" and make it an elongated sound.  In this case, you do use a "z" sound. Pronounce it "zecks."  , Pronounce it as "zeebhen." The "s" sound when it starts a sentence sounds like an English "z."  , Pronounce this German word as "ahkt."  , Pronounce it "noyn."  , Don't forget the German rule that the "z" starting a sentence is pronounced with a "ts" sound; thus, pronounce "zehn" as "tsehn."   You might also need to know how to say the word for zero in German once you've mastered how to count 1 through 10. Zero is "null," but that's pronounced as "nool."  , Once you've mastered basic German pronunciation and how to count past 10, try counting higher! It's easy.   Put the word "zehn" after each number to indicate you've added 10 when counting from 13-19. So, "neunzehn" is how you say 19 and "achtzehn" is how you say 18, and so on. Eleven is pronounced "elf" and 12 is "zwölf."Twenty is "zwanzig." To count past 20, start with the German word for the second number and add the word for the number 1-10 and "und" and then "zwanzig." So, 21 is "einundzwanzig," which literally means "1 and 20" (while dropping the "s" in "eins.") To say 22, follow the same process. The word for 22 is "zweiundzwanzig." And so on through 29. Follow the same process all the way up to 100. However, instead of zwanzig, put the words for 30 ("dreißig" - the ß is "ss" in German and pronounced the same as the "s" in English), 40 ("vierzig" - pronounced "feahtsig'), 50 ("funfzig"), 60 ("sechzig"), 70 ("siebzig"), 80 ("achtzig"), and 90 ("neunzig"). The German word for 100 is "(ein)hundert" (pronounce the "d" like a "t" and the "u" like "oo.")  , One beauty of the Internet is that it's easier than ever before to find native speakers of foreign languages to practice with. The same is true of German.   Various language sites online will match you with native speakers. Some allow you to hear pronunciation by putting your cursor on a letter.Look up You Tube videos of people speaking German, including counting from 1 to 10, so that you can hear the words before you try speaking them.Some sites use music and song to teach children and others how to count in German., German is a very common language at universities. It should be pretty easy to find a local school that teaches the language if you live in a big enough city. Otherwise, you could check online.You could also record yourself counting to 10 in German, and then play it back. This is one of the best ways to perfect your speech. Traveling to or living in Germany is going to greatly enhance your language abilities. Speaking a foreign language repeatedly to native speakers is really the best way to learn it.  

hold your mouth tightly when you speak.  learn how to pronounce german vowels.  understand how to pronounce german consonants.  start counting from 1 to 10 in german by saying the word "eins" for one.  say "zwei" for the number two.  say "drei" for the number three.  use the word "vier" for the number four.  say "fünf" for the number five.  use the word "sechs" for six in german.  say the word for seven as "sieben.",  use the word "acht" for the word eight.  say "neun" for nine.  complete your counting with the word for ten, which is "zehn.",  understand how to count past 10 in german.  find a native speaker.  take a language course online or at a university. 

 If insufficient time was given to complete a project or other effort where everyone had to pull together, the looming deadline may have caused many team members to crumble, give up or presume that someone else would manage it since they couldn't do so personally. Always ensure that there is sufficient time and be sure to review this at regular intervals during the life of the project or other purpose of the teamwork.   Time is also an enemy of the team structure itself. If you don't allow sufficient time to build the right team and to weed out those members who aren't clicking adequately, then the team probably won't cohere and will not succeed.; , If these were inadequate or unclear, there is a major reason why the team didn't perform well. It is vital to explain everything at its most basic and to allow for question and answer sessions through the life of the team's work. Never assume that team members have understood what is expected of them or what the outcome needs to be. Keep checking on understandings and if refinements are made during the life of the project, double check on understandings.  A common reason for failure as a team is that the team gets the notion that what it's doing is not worth it, is reinventing what already exists or isn't going to get used whatever they do. Any sense of pointlessness in the work being performed will destroy team spirit very quickly.  Was this person trusted, respected and listened to by the team? While team members don't need to like the leader, they do need to be motivated by this person and the leader needs to be someone who inspires confidence and a willingness to follow instructions given. The team leader is an important aspect of team success and failure to be accepted by team members is often fatal to the team's effectiveness.   Another aspect is to ask if the team leader was competent in performing the role of leading the team. Even if they were liked, they may have simply not understood what was expected of them in the way of leading, guiding and motivating the team.  All people perform better when given regular, decent feedback about what they're doing. A team is no different and it is important to praise both the team as a whole and individual members. Letting others in the organization that this team is valuable is important for boosting morale; without doing so, the team may feel it hasn't been adequately recognized or appreciated and this can sow the seeds of dissent.   This doesn't mean just positive feedback. It means both positive and negative feedback, namely any feedback at all! How do people know they need to make changes or that they're on track without feedback? Be sure the team is being told regularly how it is perceived as doing.  Related to praise, if the credit due to the team's efforts was assumed by someone else or by the organization as a whole rather than being attributed to the team and its individual members, the morale can dip for future endeavors and the team will lose its motivation. There will be a sense of "why bother since someone else gets all the glory?" if the credit isn't attributed properly.  Sometimes team members sabotage one another for reasons of their own, or internal bickering, competitiveness or territoriality can take over and spoil what could have been a cohesive team. Try to spot such "rotten eggs" within a good bunch as early as possible and move them elsewhere so that the team can get on with its work without being undermined.  Was the team given adequate resources to complete the work needed? Were the resources given on time and in the right amounts needed? If the team had to work by the smell of an oily rag and found it difficult to make ends meet, it will be evident in failed results.  

consider whether adequate time was provided to the team.  look at the goals and objectives the team worked under.  ask the team members if they felt that the work they undertook was worthwhile.  look to the team leader.  consider what feedback was given.  consider whether the team was given credit for the work it did.  look at team members individually.  consider the resources. 

 Lynch syndrome is a genetic condition. The genetic error that exists in those people with Lynch syndrome is a group of genes that code for proteins that actually help to repair genes.   This group of genes are for “mismatch repair genes,” which are those genes that repair the relatively common mistakes when DNA reproduces itself. Errors in this matching process can be repaired normally, but in Lynch Syndrome, they cannot be repaired because the genes that code for the proteins that do the repair are themselves damaged.The cause of the cancers associated with Lynch syndrome is believed to be an accumulation of these errors mutations in the DNA. If a mother or a father has one copy out of two of this gene, there is a 50% chance that it was passed on to their child.  If your genetic test is positive for Lynch syndrome, it means that your lifetime risk of cancer is between 60 and 80%. It does not mean you will definitely have colon or endometrial cancer, but the risk of colon and endometrial cancer as well as other cancers is increased.   The lifetime risk of endometrial cancer can range from 20 to 60%. The lifetime risk of other cancers are increased by less than 20%., Lynch syndrome is not treatable. If your genetic testing is positive, this means that you will need to consult with a genetic counselor as well as your physician to determine your best course of action for cancer prevention and future screening.This is likely to include a yearly colonoscopy, a yearly endometrial biopsy, as well as other screening tests, depending on your gender.  

know that lynch syndrome is a heredity condition.  understand what being positive for lynch syndrome means.  see your doctor for a cancer prevention program.

 If you are looking to buy a Javanese cat, it is important to find an upstanding, reputable breeder. Make a list of breeders in your area who deal with Javanese cats and look into their reputations with vets, friends with cats, or cat societies. Breeders should be knowledgeable about Javanese cats and should be registered with a cat society.For instance, visit the Cat Fancier's Association, Inc.'s website for breeder referrals (by state and breed) at http://secure.cfa.org/Search.aspx.  A guaranteed way to identify a Javanese cat is to look at its breeding papers, which a responsible breeder should be able to produce. Breeding papers are registration papers issued by a cat registry attesting to the fact that the cat or kitten in question is a purebred. Good breeders should be registered with a cat registry and produce breeding papers as well as pedigree papers, which show a cat's direct lineage., DNA testing is a reliable way to identify a Javanese cat. Home DNA testing kits will allow you to collect DNA from a cat (usually by means of a cheek swab) and mail it to a laboratory for analysis. Look online to comparison shop for DNA testing, which can range between $50-$150 and usually produce results in a few weeks after your sample is mailed.Note that mid-priced test kits can distinguish between more breeds than the less expensive ones, so investing more money may yield better results.  

find a reputable breeder.  ask for breeding papers.  use dna testing. 

 Relax and have faith that Jesus loves you. Right where you are. "Just As I Am" is a hymn that captures this thought perfectly. You don't need to do a thing to earn His love, and none of us can ever deserve His love. Remember the Roman centurion who asked Jesus to heal his servant; Jesus didn't ask him to repent as a condition of answering the centurion's request. What impressed Jesus was the man's faith. Despite being wholly undeserving, incredibly, amazingly, we still have His love - never forget that, and He will always bring you Home to Himself.; , Once you are born again, you cannot be "unborn." Jesus will never let you go once you have given yourself to Him. Anyone who tells you that being gay will cause you to lose your salvation is wrong. Remember the Prodigal Son. He rejected his father, asked for his inheritance before his father was even dead, took the inheritance - and left. Can you turn your back on someone any more than that? Did his father stop loving him? No. Does God ever stop loving you? NO. You may even fall away from your faith. When you come back, God will be there, still accepting you, still loving you.  Are we supposed to repent and turn away from our sins? Absolutely. But must we? No. In fact we cannot be freed from all sin while we are alive. If it were really true that we had to leave all sin behind when we accept Jesus, and never sin again as a condition of salvation, then God's mercy would not need to be infinite. He knew that sin would be a fact of everyone's life, all of our lives. Jesus says that we should not only forgive the first time someone sins against us, but "seventy times seven." That's in Matthew, by the way. How many people would you forgive after they did the same thing to you, not once, not twice, but 490 times? And yet, that's what Jesus commanded. How many of the church people you know could say they would be willing to do that? Not many, if they were honest. Probably not even one could. Yet God will, and does. Even if you accept the idea that being gay is a sin (which most, if not all churches do), remember that it is just a sin - it is the same to God as any other sin (any sin is enough to keep you out of Heaven, if not for Jesus' vicarious atonement). You can take great comfort in knowing that Jesus' sacrifice is sufficient for you - there is nothing you have done, or ever will do that's big enough to keep you away from Him.  As Jesus was dying on the cross, He said, "It is finished." But the Hebrew translation says, "It is completed." Either way you want to say it, it means the same thing - when Jesus gave His life on the cross, He paid the price for everyone's sin, once and for all. No one can add anything or take anything away from this work - it was completed by Jesus alone. No matter what else others may say is necessary for you to achieve salvation, remember that Jesus has already completed this work. Obey the 10 Commandments because it's smart, and because you want to follow the rules God set out for us. But doing that will not get you to Heaven - not without Jesus.  Don't let those who would hang you up on loopholes or technicalities convince you that you aren't really saved. The Bible is very clear (they will tell you this, too, but they will mean something altogether different - don't let them scare you). It doesn't say, "Do good works to your neighbor to be saved." It doesn't say, "First, get right with God." No, it doesn't - read it yourself. Don't listen to others telling you what it says, not even this article. But we can quote a little here: "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that BELIEVETH on me hath everlasting life." (Note that He says "verily" twice - that means it was important enough to repeat it. "Verily" means "I'm telling the truth here.") That's from John 6:43-47. It also says, "…and all our righteousness are as filthy rags." —Isaiah 64:6. This means that you can do all the good things you want, but without Jesus, they don't mean anything to your salvation. Very simply put, you can do nothing to get into Heaven or to save yourself - except to Believe in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior. When it comes right down to it, those people are really saying that what Jesus did was good enough to save them, but not to save you. Let them know that you don't plan to be the one to say that to Jesus Christ and see how they react.  Christian faith is a deeply personal and intimate relationship between you and Jesus Christ. Sometimes, church-going people forget this, and instead become fixated on the dogma, or the rules, of their particular church denomination. Don't fall prey to giving too much weight to the opinions of other humans. Instead, rely on God, and remember that only God can put on your heart what He wants from you. As you grow in your relationship with Him, you will know what things He wants you to change or to work on. Again, listen to Him.  Many Christian religious bodies, unfortunately, seem to feel that excommunication is necessary. First, they may pressure you to renounce your homosexuality. When you are unable to comply, they may inform you that you are no longer welcome to their fellowship. Never mind that Jesus would never do this - He insisted upon spending time and cultivating relationships with people the church despised. You're in good company. Find a new church where you can be welcomed and accepted for who you are.  Most people are simply resistant to ideas they themselves are not familiar with. Be logical and remain calm - above all, don't buy into any hysterical exchanges about sinfulness, etc.  Most of these people do know a gay person, but don't realize it. You have an opportunity to show them that gay people aren't contagious or perverted. If you can find it within yourself to help them see you as an individual of faith and value, you may be able to help others like yourself. Even if you are uncomfortable with their bigoted or ignorant questions and assumptions, you may be able to educate them.  No one can walk your Walk for you. Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't really saved, that your faith isn't good enough, or that "even the devil believes in Jesus." The devil may indeed believe in Jesus, but you have accepted Jesus as your Lord and Savior - the devil has not. This is your Walk. Walk it your way, with a humble heart and your head held high, remembering that it is you who will stand before Jesus one day and answer Him as to whether you owned Him as your Lord and Savior - those people will not be able to answer for you. Have faith that He knows your heart and will know that your answer is true.  People who don't have a gay person in their lives (or at least, don't realize that they do) may surprise you with their reactions. Try to maintain a sense of humor if they make clueless or homophobic remarks, and remember that you are as clueless about other things as they are about you - try to keep a compassionate perspective.  Even if your present church refuses to accept you as you are, there will be others who will welcome you. Rather than crying forever over the things you have lost, try instead to focus on the blessings you do have in your life.  

rest in the lord.  never accept that you can lose your salvation.  don't buy into conditional salvation.  stand on the simplicity of jesus christ's completed work.  believe.  realize that your faith is your faith - nobody has the right to tell you that it isn't real, or that it isn't good enough.  accept that you may need to find a new church home.  listen critically and apply logic.  be the gay person in their lives.  remember that this is your christian walk.  maintain your sense of humor and humility.  remain a person of dignity, integrity,support, and faith. 

 The objective of the game is to conquer the world by controlling all of the countries on the board. You do this by attacking other players and taking over new territories on the board. All the while, you need to make sure that your own territories are well-defended., Before you start your game, make sure that you have all of the game components. The game of Risk comes with a foldable game board, a set of 72 cards, and various army tokens.The Risk board has 6 continents — North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Australian Archipelago — and 42 countries. The Risk armies come in six basic colors, along with different kinds of tokens, denoting size of the army. Each set has Infantry (which represents 1 “army”), Cavalry (5 armies), and Artillery (10 armies). A pack of 56 Risk cards should be included. 42 cards are marked with countries as well as an infantry, cavalry, or artillery symbol. There are two "Wild" cards, and 12 "Mission" cards that come with the Secret Mission Risk variant. There should be five dice (three red and two white).  Before you get started, figure out how many people will be playing the game. The total amount of armies you start the game with depends on how many players there are:6 players - 20 armies each 5 players - 25 armies each 4 players - 30 armies each 3 players - 35 armies each 2 players - 40 armies each (this varies between editions)  , This will determine the starting points for all players. Each territory must have one “army” in it at all times. There are two ways to determine the initial territories:Have each player roll a die (Standard Rules). The player that rolled the highest value will choose an open territory and place one soldier in it. Moving clock-wise, each player will select an open territory until all territories are occupied. Once players have claimed all the 42 territories on the board, players place their remaining armies onto territories they already claim in any order they choose. Deal out the deck of cards (Alternate Rules). Deal out the entire deck of cards, minus the two Wild cards. Have each player place one of their army pieces in each territory according to the cards they are holding. Take turns doing this.  The player who rolls the highest number starts the game. Then the play order goes clockwise from the starting player. The game starts after the order of play has been determined., Each player can redeem his armies in whatever unit s/he wants (infantry, cavalry, or artillery), provided they all add up to the same number of armies. So if a player gets seven armies at the beginning of his turn, he can redeem them by getting either seven infantry pieces or by getting one cavalry piece and two infantry pieces (which add up to seven)., At the beginning of each turn, players receive more armies. The number of armies is determined by:The number of territories you own. For every three countries, the player gets one army. For example, if you had 11 countries, you would receive 3 armies; if you had 22 countries, you would receive 7 armies. Turning in cards. Cards can be turned in when you have a three of a kind (e.g. all three cards have artillery pictures) or all three types of armies (soldier, cavalry, artillery). For the first set of cards you turn in, you receive 4 armies; 6 for the second; 8 for the third; 10 for the fourth; 12 for the fifth; 15 for the sixth; and for every additional set thereafter, 5 more armies than the previous set turned in. If you have 5 or more Risk cards at the beginning of a turn, you must turn at least one set of them in. Owning all the territories of a continent. For each continent that you completely dominate (no other enemy armies are present), you receive reinforcements. You receive 3 armies for Africa, 7 armies for Asia, 2 armies for Australia, 5 armies for Europe, 5 armies for North America and 2 armies for South America.  Note: if the amount of armies you would receive at the beginning of your turn is less than three, round up to three.  You may place the armies you received at the beginning of your turn wherever you have an army presence, in whatever proportion. If you wish, you can place one army in each of your territories; or you can place all of your armies in one territory. The choice is up to you.If, during the beginning of your turn, you turned in a set of cards with a territory that you owned, you receive two extra infantrymen. You must place those infantrymen on the territory specified by the card.  You may only attack other territories that are adjacent to a territory you own or that are connected to a territory you own by a sea-lane. For example, you cannot attack India from the Eastern United States because the territories are not adjacent., You may attack the same territory more than once, or you may attack different territories. You can attack the same territory from the same adjacent position, or you can attack it from different adjacent positions.Understand that attacking is optional. A player may decide not to attack at all during a turn, only deploying armies.  When you want to attack another territory, you have to declare your intentions out loud. For example, you could say "I'm attacking Eastern United States from Western United States.", Because your territory must be occupied at all times, you must leave at least one army behind. The number of armies you attack with will determine how many dice you get to roll when you square off the opponent whose territory you are defending.1 army = 1 die 2 armies = 2 dice 3 armies = 3 dice  , You roll up to three red dice, depending on your troop size. The defending player rolls the same number of white dice as the number of troops in their defending territory, with a maximum of two.Match up the highest red die with the highest white die, and match the second highest red die with the second highest white die. If there is only one white die, only match up the highest red die with the white die.Remove one of your pieces from the attacking territory if the white die is higher or equal to its corresponding red die. Remove one of your opponent’s pieces from the defending territory if the red die is higher to its corresponding white die.  If you successfully wipe out all of the defending armies in the area you are attacking, then will need to occupy the territory with at least as many attacking armies as used in the attack. If you attack with three dice (or three armies), you must colonize the newly-acquired territory with at least three armies, although you can choose to colonize it with more if you wish., If at the end of your attacking turn you've conquered at least one territory, then you have earned a Risk card. You cannot earn more than one Risk card for this. The goal is to collect sets of three “Risk” cards to exchange them for new armies.If you manage to wipe out an opponent by destroying his or her last army, you gain possession of all the Risk cards he or she may have had in their hands.  If you territories are not well fortified, then they will be vulnerable to attack from your opponents. To keep your territories safe from attack during your opponents' attack phases, move your pieces where you want them before ending your turn., Move your pieces to different territories at the end of your turn. It is in your best interest to move pieces to your border territories that are more vulnerable to attacks by your opponents. There are two rules on how you can move your pieces:Standard Rule: Move any number of army pieces from a single territory into an adjacent territory occupied by you.  Alternate Rule: You can move pieces anywhere, as long as the starting point and destination can be reached by going through a string of adjacent territories under your control.  In order to retain control of the territories that you are moving army pieces from, make sure that you leave at least one of your army pieces on each territory that you own. Otherwise, you will no longer have control of the territory., Risk is a strategy game, so it rewards players who employ tactics and who outsmart their opponents. The three pieces of strategic advice given to players by the Risk rulebook include:Try to hold entire continents to get the bonus reinforcements. Your might is measured in army reinforcements, so it's a good strategy to get as many reinforcements as possible. Watch your borders for buildups of enemy armies that could imply an impending attack. Make sure your own borders are properly fortified against enemy attack. Cluster your reinforcements mostly along your borders to make it harder for enemies to penetrate your territory.  One way to improve your chances of winning is to go on the offensive right away and attack your opponents every chance that you get. This strategy will help you to gain more territories quickly, which will give you more armies to work with at the beginning of your turns. Attacking often will also take armies away from your opponents, so they will have fewer armies to work with., Eliminating weak opponents with plenty of Risk cards has two benefits: it gets rid of an enemy as well as netting you extra cards. Pay attention to your opponents’ cards in hand as well as their potential weaknesses to determine if there is anyone you can take out during the game.  Players who regularly play Risk know that certain continents can be more advantageous to seize control of than other continents. For example, conquering small continents is an advantage because they have fewer territories and are easier to control.Other strategies around continents include:   Australia Theory. Start in Australia and hold control of it. This will give you two extra reinforcements per turn, and it can only be accessed by one territory. Build troops and move up through Asia when it begins to weaken. North America Theory. Begin in North America, fortify it against Europe and Asia. Move down to South America, cut through Africa and move up. This operates on the assumption that Asia and Europe are fighting each other to expand. Africa Theory. Begin in Africa, then fortify it against Europe and South America. Move left to South America, cut through North America and move to Asia through Alaska. This operates on the assumption that Asia, North America and Europe are fighting each other to expand. Try not to begin in Asia; it has too many borders to fortify and will quickly lead to over-expansion and spreading your troops thin.  Instead of attacking as much as you can, you might choose to defend your borders and build up your troops. While you will not receive the continent bonus of armies at the beginning of your turn, having strong defenses will make it harder for your opponents to attack you and win., While this isn't outlined as a "rule" in the official book, you may benefit from creating agreements with players to help each other and take out other players. Just keep in mind that you will eventually need to attack each other. A sample agreement might be something like, "Neither of us will expand into Africa until Alexander is out of the game." This will make it easier to concentrate your efforts on other objectives.  

understand the basic objective of the game.  check the game’s components.  determine how many people are going to be playing.  set up your initial territories.  roll the dice to determine who goes first.  select army units.  get your new armies at the beginning of each turn.  place your armies.  attack adjacent territories.  attack any number of times from any one of your territories to any adjacent territory.  declare that you are going to attack.  decide how many armies you are going to use in your attack.  roll the dice.  occupy the territory if you win it.  get a risk card if you can.  understand that you cannot move armies around until your next attacking turn.  fortify your territories.  remember to leave at least one army piece behind.  know the three basic strategies described in the risk rulebook.  attack as much as possible early in the game.  eliminate weak players with lots of risk cards.  learn the continent theories.  use a defensive strategy to hold onto a cluster of countries that fall across several continents.  create allies.

 A quadratic polynomial is a polynomial to the second degree.This means that no variable will have an exponent greater than 2. Because this is a second-degree polynomial, it will have two roots, or solutions.For example, x2+8x−20{\displaystyle x^{2}+8x-20} is a quadratic polynomial, because the variable x{\displaystyle x} has an exponent of 2{\displaystyle 2}.  This means that the term with the exponent of 2{\displaystyle 2} is listed first, followed by the first-degree term, followed by the constant.For example, you would rewrite 8x+x2−20{\displaystyle 8x+x^{2}-20} as x2+8x−20{\displaystyle x^{2}+8x-20}.  This is a necessary step for solving all polynomials.  For example, x2+8x−20=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+8x-20=0}.  To do this, split up the first-degree term (the x{\displaystyle x} term). You are looking for two numbers whose sum is equal to the first degree coefficient, and whose product is equal to the constant. For example, for the quadratic polynomial x2+8x−20=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+8x-20=0}, you need to find two numbers (a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b}), where a+b=8{\displaystyle a+b=8}, and a⋅b=−20{\displaystyle a\cdot b=-20}.   Since you have −20{\displaystyle -20}, you know that one of the number will be negative.  You should see that 10+(−2)=8{\displaystyle 10+(-2)=8} and 10⋅(−2)=−20{\displaystyle 10\cdot (-2)=-20}. Thus, you will split up 8x{\displaystyle 8x} into 10x−2x{\displaystyle 10x-2x} and rewrite the quadratic polynomial: x2+10x−2x−20=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+10x-2x-20=0}.  To do this, factor out a term common to the first two terms in the polynomial.For example, the first two terms in the polynomial x2+10x−2x−20=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+10x-2x-20=0} are x2+10x{\displaystyle x^{2}+10x}. A term common to both is x{\displaystyle x}. Thus, the factored group is x(x+10){\displaystyle x(x+10)}.  To do this, factor out a term common to the second two terms in the polynomial.  For example, the second two terms in the polynomial x2+10x−2x−20=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+10x-2x-20=0} are −2x−20{\displaystyle -2x-20}. A term common to both is −2{\displaystyle -2}. Thus, the factored group is −2(x+10){\displaystyle -2(x+10)}.  A binomial is a two-term expression. You already have one binomial, which is the expression in parentheses for each group. This expression should be the same for each group. The second binomial is created by combining the two terms that were factored out of each group.  For example, after factoring by grouping, x2+10x−2x−20=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+10x-2x-20=0} becomes x(x+10)−2(x+10)=0{\displaystyle x(x+10)-2(x+10)=0}.   The first binomial is (x+10){\displaystyle (x+10)}.   The second binomial is (x−2){\displaystyle (x-2)}.   So the original quadratic polynomial, x2+8x−20=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+8x-20=0} can be written as the factored expression (x+10)(x−2)=0{\displaystyle (x+10)(x-2)=0}.  To do this, solve for x{\displaystyle x} in the first binomial.For example, to find the first root for (x+10)(x−2)=0{\displaystyle (x+10)(x-2)=0}, you would first set the first binomial expression to 0{\displaystyle 0} and solve for x{\displaystyle x}. Thus:x+10=0{\displaystyle x+10=0}x+10−10=0−10{\displaystyle x+10-10=0-10}x=−10{\displaystyle x=-10}So, the first root of the quadratic polynomial x2+8x−20=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+8x-20=0} is −10{\displaystyle -10}.  To do this, solve for x{\displaystyle x} in the second binomial.For example, to find the second root for (x+10)(x−2)=0{\displaystyle (x+10)(x-2)=0}, you would set the second binomial expression to 0{\displaystyle 0} and solve for x{\displaystyle x}. Thus:x−2=0{\displaystyle x-2=0}x−2+2=0+2{\displaystyle x-2+2=0+2}x=2{\displaystyle x=2}So, the second root of the quadratic polynomial x2+8x−20=0{\displaystyle x^{2}+8x-20=0} is 2{\displaystyle 2}.   

determine whether you have a quadratic polynomial.  make sure the polynomial is written in order of degree.  set the equation to equal zero.  rewrite the expression as a four-term expression.  factor by grouping.  factor the second group.  rewrite the polynomial as two binomials.  find the first root, or solution.  find the second root, or solution. 

 Make sure to choose a style of equipment either Western or English or else the horse would look silly all dressed up in dressage equipment(an english competition) with a bulky western saddle. If you like even add a rider.  Colour the equipment too! If the horse is suppose to look real use black or brown for the leather saddles or bridles since that is the most common colour for them.  

once you are done adding those details, you can add tack or equipment, such as: saddles, bridles, saddle blankets, breast plates, horseshoes, halters with or without lead rope, polo wraps/leg wraps and ear bonnets.  once done all that, colour your horse! 

 If you don’t have SNMP set up on your devices, you will need to configure them using the command line:   Open a command prompt and telnet into your router. Login to the device. Go into privilege mode by typing in enable. This allows you to make configuration changes. Type in conf t to give the device configuration commands. You’ll see a banner to enter in configuration commands. You will now need to enter in 3 lines of commands to tell the router to start NetFlow and export the data:  ip flow-export source fastethernet0/0 (export and source traffic to fastethernet0/0) ip flow-export source version 5 (this exports ver. 5 NetFlow, the best to start with) ip flow-export destination <IP> <port> (location of NMS to send the data to)  ; , Tell that interface what traffic you require:   ip flow egress (monitor outbound flow) ip flow ingress (monitor inbound flow) ip route-cache flow  , 

check if you have snmp access to your router.  specify the interface you want to analyze the traffic on by using the interface fastethernet0/0 command.  exit the interface, exit privilege mode, and type in one more important command:  wr mem (saves configuration data)  

 In addition to exceptions under the First Amendment, many states have statutory exceptions.   You can find state law resources by searching online or by visiting the public law library in your local courthouse. In all states, exceptions are made for news and commentary or for creative works. These exceptions are based on the First Amendment.Some states also have statutes that specifically exempt news reporting or legitimate commentary of current events, particularly on the internet.For example, if you wrote a commentary on your blog expressing your opinion about gay rights, and included a picture taken at a gay pride parade, your use of that photo typically would be protected under an exception should someone in the photo sue you for appropriation.Creative works loosely based on real events also are protected.For example, if you wrote a historical novel about events in your town during the 1960s, but used some real names of political figures during that time, your use of their names typically would be protected under the exception if one of those people were to sue you for appropriation. In most states, this exception is an affirmative defense, which means you have the burden of proving the elements of that offense. For example, California law provides an affirmative defense for creative works, provided the artist or creator proves either that the creative work adds something to the plaintiff's name or likeness, giving it a new meaning, or that the value of the work itself doesn't come primarily from the value of the plaintiff's name or likeness., If you intend to argue your use fits into an exception, you may benefit from hiring an experienced First Amendment or media law attorney.   Your state or local bar association will have a directory of attorneys licensed to practice law near you. Often these directories are available on the bar association's website, and you can search for attorneys who practice in particular areas. Look for attorneys who have experience defending against misappropriation or other invasion of privacy cases. Nonprofit organizations dedicated to First Amendment issues also will have legal resources available., If your use falls within a Constitutional or statutory exception, you can state this defense in your answer to the complaint.   Keep in mind that just because you raise this defense in your answer, you don't have to argue it at trial – if the case even gets to that point. Stating the defense in your answer merely preserves your right to argue it later on. If you believe your use falls into one of the exceptions – either those recognized under the First Amendment or those included in your state's law – you should assert that defense as soon as possible.  If you are asserting an exception, you typically bear the burden of proving that it applies to your use.Context matters a lot with defenses against appropriation of name or likeness claims. If you're arguing one of these exceptions, you must be prepared to prove that your use falls into that exception.  

look for statutory exceptions.  consider hiring an attorney.  claim the appropriate exception.  collect evidence to support your claim. 

 Place the butter and the marshmallows into a microwave-safe bowl. This will be the first of your six colors: red/pink, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. Set the rest of the butter and marshmallows aside for now.You can use fewer colors if you want. You'll still use the same amount of butter and marshmallows for each color, however.; , This will take about 2 minutes.After 1 minute, pause the microwave and give the mixture a stir with a rubber spatula. If the marshmallows still aren't melted after 2 minutes, continue heating them at 1-minute intervals, stirring between each one., You will only need a few drops of red or pink food coloring.The more you add, the brighter your color will be. You can use either liquid or gel food coloring, but gel would give you the best results.  You can start with purple instead, if you prefer. This will be the bottom layer.  Fold it in using a rubber spatula.Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl often so that everything mixes in evenly., Generously butter a 9 by 13-inch (22.86 by 33.02-centimeter) baking pan. Use a rubber spatula to spread the marshmallow mixture evenly across the bottom, from corner-to-corner.For a neater finish, place a sheet of greased wax or parchment paper on top, then pat it down. This will help get the mixture into the corners. Peel away the paper when finished.  Using a clean bowl, melt together 2 tablespoons (30 grams) of butter and 1½ cups (75 grams) of mini marshmallows. Stir in a few drops of your next color, then add in 2 cups (50 grams) of puffed rice cereal. Spread it across the rice krispie mixture in the pan, and pat it down. Keep doing this until you reach purple.If you are using a different color scheme, use 2 tablespoons (30 grams) butter, 1½ cups (75 grams) mini marshmallows, and 2 cups (50 grams) of cereal for each color. For an extra touch, add some rainbow sprinkles on top of the final layer., This will take 1 to 2 hours.If you are in a hurry, chill the rice krispies in the freezer for 30 minutes., This recipe makes at least 16 to 20 bars.You can also cut 35 smaller bars instead. 

combine 2 tablespoons (30 grams) of butter and 1½ cups (75 grams) of mini marshmallows.  melt the butter and marshmallows in the microwave.  stir in your first color with a rubber spatula.  add in 2 cups (50 grams) of puffed rice cereal.  spread the mixture across the bottom of a buttered baking pan.  repeat the previous steps for each color.  let the rice krispies cool.  remove the rice krispies from the pan, then cut them into bars.you can cut the bars as large or as small as you'd like. 

 If you do not already have a valid passport, you will need to get one before you apply for a visa to visit Vietnam. Most state departments will require your birth certificate, proof of residence, headshot photos, a completed application, and the appropriate fee. Some countries may require an in-person interview.Processing time will vary, but you should allow four to six weeks. If you already have a passport, it must have at least six months of validity past the date you expect to exit Vietnam.; , In order to apply for a visa to visit Vietnam, you must have access to a computer with reliable Internet access to fill out the application form. Once you begin the application, you must complete it within 15 minutes or it may time out and you will lose your work.   You must have an email address to receive your application confirmation and other documents. The computer must have Adobe Acrobat Reader or other PDF-compatible software to open the documents. You will need to be able to print your visa application and other documents.  To complete the visa application, you will need a photo that is less than one year old. The photo must have physical measurements of 4 X 6 cm . This is a standard passport size. The photo must have a white or light background and show your full face. You cannot be wearing a hat or tinted glasses. Both of your ears must be visible. If you are having photos taken for your passport application, you can use the same photo if it meets the specifications.  To complete your visa application, you will need to know your entry date and your exit date, if you will be leaving the country during your visit, and the address where you will be staying. You will also need to give the name, address, phone number, and email address of an emergency contact.   If you are traveling for personal reasons, such as tourism, you can receive a visa for either 30 days or 3 months. You can apply for a visa up to six months before your departure date. While visas can be expedited for emergencies, for a standard travel visa, apply at least 30 days before your departure to leave time for processing. Do not finalize your travel plans until you have your visa in hand. Applications are occasionally rejected for reasons that the Vietnamese authorities will not explain. If you are rejected, there is no appeal. If you need an emergency visa, contact the Vietnam embassy in your home country for procedures and fees.  You will apply online through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Vietnam website. You may complete the application in English, German, French, or Vietnamese.During the application process, you will select the consulate where you will submit your application. Select the one in your country of citizenship or country of residence. If you are an American resident, the Embassy of Vietnam in Washington D.C. has provided an English language version of the application that you can print out and fill in the blanks., Once it is printed, you will sign it at the bottom in the block marked "applicant signature," in blue ink to indicate an original document and attach one copy of your passport-sized photograph, and your original passport., Fees may vary depending on the country where you are applying. The fee for applying from the United States is currently USD $100. To confirm the exact fee, including any special services, contact the consulate where you will be submitting your application.   The fee must be made payable to the "Embassy of Vietnam" and paid via money order or cashier's check in the currency of the country where you are applying.If you do not include the correct fee, your application will be returned unprocessed or denied.  In order to have your passport returned safely, along with your visa, used a secure service with tracking information such as Federal Express.   The recommended envelope is either a 9X12 inch manila envelope (or equivalent) or the standard document envelope provided by the secure shipping service. The return postage amount for the consulate to return the package to you will be the same amount as you had to pay to send it to the consulate.  Once you submit your completed visa application to the appropriate consulate, expect the processing time of five working days. Adding in time for return mail, you should have your passport with your visa to visit Vietnam affixed to it within two weeks. You may now proceed with finalizing your travel plans.   Completing your application online will avoid the most common mistake, which is omitting required information. If you have left a required field blank, the application will ask you to fix the error. If you have a valid passport and completed every section of the application, you should be granted a visa. If you are denied, contact the consulate where you applied for an explanation and ask if you can reapply. If the authorities refuse to give an explanation, it is likely that your visa has been denied for a political reason and will not be granted under any circumstances.  

obtain a passport from your home country.  secure computer access.  take your visa photo.  detail your travel plans.  complete the online application form.  print out the completed application.  pay the processing fee.  include a prepaid return envelope.  receive your visa. 

 The left needle will have the rest of the stitches. In this tutorial, the stitch just before the yarn over will be called the "first stitch." The stitch after the yarn over will be called the "next stitch."   Pay attention to your stitch pattern. When working the English style, you will need to move the yarn into the correct position. This will depend on what the first stitch was, and what the next stitch will be.; , Bring the yarn towards you, under the right needle. Next, drape the yarn over the top of the needle, away from you.          This is called a "yarn forward" or "yfwd" in knitting patterns.  Bring the yarn under the right needle, towards you. Drape the yarn over the top of the right needle, away from you. Next, wrap the yarn under the needle back towards you again.          This is called a "yarn 'round need" or "yrn" in knitting patterns.  Simply drape the yarn over the top of the right needle as you bring it towards you.          This is called a "yarn over needle" or "yon" in knitting patterns.  Drape the yarn over the top of the right needle, away from you. Next, wrap the yarn under the right needle, towards you.         This is called a "yarn 'round need" or "yrn" in knitting patterns.  Stick the right needle through next stitch on the left needle. Wrap the yarn under and over the tip of the right needle. Use the tip of the right needle to pull the yarn back through the stitch. Keep the working yarn on the right needle, and slip the stitch off the left needle.          Some patterns call for you to yarn over twice. Simply wrap the yarn around the right needle like you did previously, then complete the next stitch.  When you do the next row, you will eventually go over the extra stitch you got from the yarn over. You will get a lace-like hole that also acts as an increase. 

have at least one stitch done on your right needle.  if the first stitch and the next stitch are both knits, wrap the yarn under and over the needle.  if the first stitch was a knit, and the next stitch is a purl, wrap the yarn around the needle, from back to front.  if the first stitch was a purl, and the next stitch is a knit, bring the yarn towards the front.  if the previous stitch and the next stitch are both purls, wrap the yarn, over the needle from front to back.  finish the next stitch.  finish the row, as the pattern directs. 

; ,, Safe hitchhiking is much easier when drivers are not traveling too fast.   Drivers close to urban centers tend to travel only short distances. To increase your chances of attracting a driver going a long way, walk a few miles or kilometers until you reach a less developed area. You will need to be prepared to grab your belongings and hop in. If you get a ride in the cab of a truck, the wind may blow away unsecured items. ,,,   Sticking your thumb out will not set you apart. Create a colorful sign indicating your destination, dance, or unfurl a flag, anything that will make drivers notice you and help assure your sanity and safety to drivers and other passengers. , If you are the slightest bit suspicious about anything, decline the ride graciously.  Making friends during foreign travel can lead to interesting suggestions and more free rides.   Be sure to understand the terms of the agreement of hitching a ride. Some drivers may expect a monetary contribution to gas. It is important to validate all expectations up front. Standing by traffic is not safe in the dark, and you can always return to town or camp in a safe spot. 

choose your destination, research and learn the basics of the local language.  maintain a well-groomed and welcoming appearance.  ,  travel to the edge of town on a well-used, but not excessively busy, road.pack you gear tightly and well.  choose a safe spot by the side of the road where it's easy for vehicles to see you and slow down.  ,  face oncoming traffic and observe potential rides; move quickly when someone stops to pick you up.  ,  adopt a creative approach for attracting attention to your cause.  approach drivers that pull over with a smile and be clear about where you want to go.  ,  inspect the vehicle and its interior before you get in.  converse with your driver, if you are able.  leave the roadside before night falls.  

 Such as electronics. Those things are usually relatively pretty popular and can possibly hold the most chances of you earning big bucks.; , Look through items carefully to see what's currently selling.  Preferably something you can actually afford to spend.  Electronics, books, computers, and others.  Like if an item was a laptop for $250, if the person is willing to haggle, consider trying to buy it for $200. , Some people might sell you useless junk item or the item doesn't function as well as it was described, so ask to test the item out is recommended.  Doing so will help you reassure your buyers that the product is well maintained and clean.  For example, if the item was originally for $250 and you knocked the price down to $200, then start from $275 and start from there. And try NOT to sell the item lower than $30 for how much you had spent it for or it might be worth the trip unless if that was the best you could do with it.  Because doing so will help you attract more buyers, rather then no pictures available.  Quite often, someone might post an item that could be used to make a quick $5 or more. Items that could be sold for some money are like usable TVs, books or something that you could use to fix up if you are a bit of a handyman.  

think of an object that is not too expensive or inexpensive but relatively popular.  go to craigslist site and locate the country/city you're in to know what kind of items is selling around the areas you live in.  create a budget you want to spend with.  look through items you want to make money on that doesn't necessarily offer much risks in order to make money on.  try to haggle with the person if he/she is willing.  buy the item whenever you and the seller had made the deal and gets the item.  ,  if you want to sell electronics then make sure it's actually usable.  after finishing the transaction, make sure to test the item out further just to see if there's anything else that needed to be replaced, deleted or whatever it needed attending to.  consider selling the item slightly higher than how much the other seller was selling the product for.  consider taking a picture of the item if possible.  go to free items section on a regular basis. 

 To make a canvas on a wood frame, you will need the following supplies. You can find these supplies at your local art store.A long piece of art canvas. You should get a canvas that is long enough to create your ideal canvas size. Four stretcher bars. These are wooden bars that have notches on one end. You should get two stretcher bars that are the ideal width you want for the canvas and two stretcher bars that are the ideal height you want for the canvas, for example, 16 x 24 or 11 x 15. A hammer. A staple gun. A pair of scissors. Acrylic based gesso. A paintbrush. Sandpaper. Palette paper.; , Take one long stretcher bar and one short stretcher bar. Slide the notched ends of the stretcher bars together, pushing with your hands until the two ends side together. They should be flush with each other, forming a diagonal line where the two ends meet.         Repeat this with the two remaining stretcher bars until you have built a wooden frame composing of all four stretcher bars.  To ensure the sides of the canvas are fitted properly and securely, you can use the hammer to tap the sides. Do this on the outside of the wooden frame and tap lightly so the ends are firmly joined together.  Spread the canvas out on a flat surface, such as a table. Then, place the wooden frame on top of the canvas. Gently fold the canvas so it covers the length of the wooden frame and the ends fold over the wooden frame so the stretchers are covered by the canvas.         Use the scissors to make a cut and then use your hands to tear the canvas so the excess canvas comes off. Do this by holding down one half of the canvas and tearing the excess canvas off at an angle. Repeat this on the other side of the wooden frame until the canvas fits the wooden frame.  Use the staple gun to attach the canvas to the frame. Fold over one short side of the canvas so it covers the stretcher bar and then staple the canvas to the stretcher bar. Place one staple on one end, one staple in the centre, and one on the other end for a total of three staples.         Rotate the frame and pull the canvas very tightly on the opposite end. Then, attach the canvas to the other short side of the canvas with three staples. Leave the centre staple for last. Turn the frame to the longer side. Fold the canvas over the frame. You will notice a notch of canvas that sticks out when you fold the canvas over the frame. Use your index finger to gently push in this notch so it tucks into the fold. Then, pull the canvas up as tight as possible and push it down over the frame. Attach the canvas to the frame with a staple over the folded corner. Repeat these steps for the other corner, making sure to push down the notch, pull the canvas tightly and fold it over. Secure the canvas with a staple. Finish attaching the rest of the canvas to the frame by pulling tightly on the canvas and staple it down. You can put six staples on the longer ends of the canvas to ensure it is secure.  To make the canvas smooth, tight, and ready for painting, you will need to prime it. Do this by applying acrylic based gesso to the canvas so it dries stiff and taunt.         Start by shaking up the acrylic based gesso. Then, pour the gesso onto a sheet of palette paper. Use the paint brush to paint the entire area of the canvas. You should do one thick coat of the paint, making sure to get the sides of the canvas as well. Let the gesso dry. Then, use the sandpaper to sand the canvas. Sand the canvas using small, circular motions. Do one layer of sanding on the canvas and don't worry too much about making it very smooth. After one sanding session, pour gesso onto the palette paper and use the brush to add another layer of gesso to the entire canvas. You can use a hair dryer to dry the gesso faster. Once the gesso is dry, sand the canvas one more time. Try to make the canvas really smooth. After a good sanding, the canvas is ready for use.  

gather your supplies.  fit the stretcher bars together.  tap the sides lightly with the hammer.  cut the canvas to fit the wood frame.  attach the canvas to the frame.  prime the canvas. 

 If you want to stop a check payment after you have sent it, it is vital that you act quickly. This is different from voiding a check, and generally incurs a fee. In order to save time with the bank, make sure you have all the necessary information on the check you want to cancel. The information required may vary by bank, but you should make sure you have the following details:   The check number, the amount the check was for, and the date of the check. The payee, that is the person or organisation who you wrote the check to. The reason to stop the payment, for example you wrote the wrong amount on the check., Depending on your bank, you will probably be able to cancel a check through your online banking account.It's essential that you do this quickly. If the payment has been processed, the only way to stop it is by contacting your bank directly and getting a "Stop Payment Order."A stop payment order is an order not to pay a check that has been issued but not yet cashed. If requested soon enough, the check will not be debited from the payer's account. Most banks charge a fee for this serviceLog into your account and seek out the customer services and options provided by your bank. If you have the option to stop a check payment or void a check, select this and cancel the appropriate check number. Make sure you copy the number across correctly or you might cancel the wrong payment.  If you don't have access to online banking, or just want to deal with a real person, phone up your bank directly. You will be asking them for a "Stop Payment Order." Speed is important, so using the phone is a good option if you get through to somebody in customer services without spending too long on hold.   A stop payment order is an order not to pay a check that has been issued but not yet cashed. If requested soon enough, the check will not be debited from the payer's account. Most banks charge a fee for this service.Before you call, make sure you have all the same information about the check you want to cancel that you would need to cancel it online: the check number, amount, and date; the payee, and the reason you need to stop the payment.  

ensure you have all the required information.  void the check online.  phone your bank. 

 Your insult can either be broad, such as wearing a T-shirt with an insulting message intended for no specific person, or directed to a specific person for a specific bad behavior. Broad insults are great for days when you’re mad at the world or just want to be seen as a crusty curmudgeon, while specific insults are best when you want to haul someone up short for doing wrong by you.   Being specific also lets you focus on the person’s behavior instead of on the person as a whole when the person’s action is what prompts you to deliver an insult. Being broad-based, in contrast, can be useful when you’ve had enough of a person because of the sum total of his or her bad behaviors and wish to have nothing further to do with that person. Here, an Old World-style curse to wander the earth forever and never know a moment’s peace may be better than a few choice words from Don Rickles’ repertoire.; , You can deliver your insult directly to the recipient of your wrath in no uncertain terms, damn him or her with faint praise, or let someone else insult the recipient for you.   Insulting the person directly requires you to be willing to confront others, both the person you’re insulting and any of his or her supporters who may be within earshot. You’ll also have to be prepared for any possible reprisals, whether in the form of counter-insults, threats or acts of violence, or criminal acts against your property. Damning with faint praise means to use words that sound innocuous or even complimentary, but are actually intended to put someone down. Examples would be calling someone “alliaceous” or “cepaceous,” which compare the person to a bulb of garlic or an onion, or branding someone who speaks nonsense a “phlyarologist.” These words are best delivered in a gentle tone of voice and to recipients whose vocabulary isn’t as large as yours.Letting someone else insult the person for you can mean reporting actual derogatory comments made by a third party to the recipient, embellishing the third party’s comments to make them insulting, or attributing your insult to a third party when delivering it to the recipient. All these options require the third party to be someone whose opinion would matter to the recipient without the recipient’s checking to verify the third party actually said what you claimed the third party did., As the world increasingly becomes a global marketplace, you are more likely to encounter people of different ethnicities and cultures than before. Each culture has developed its own insults according to what it considers the most offensive things, which may or may not be the same as yours.   Animal references are popular, such as the German ‘’Schweinhund’’ (“pig dog”) or ‘’Esel’’ (“jackass”). Scatological references (bathroom humor) are also common, such as calling someone a “p*** artist” in Ireland, meaning that the person urinates on himself or herself when drunk. Other countries prefer going Number 2, as in Taiwan’s ‘’Gou pi’’ (“dog f**t”) or Bosnia’s ‘’Sanjam da prdnem na tebe’’ (“I dream of f**ting on you”). Some cultures go in for sexual references, such as China’s ‘’Ham sep lo’’ (“salty wet man”), their way of calling someone oversexed. Wishing someone harm always seems to be in style, as in the Dutch ‘’Krijg de kanker’’ (“Get the cancer”), which sounds so much cooler than the classic “Curl up and die!” Then there’s the Bosnian ‘’ A bog da ti kuca bila’’ (roughly, “May your house be live on CNN”), which is equivalent to wishing your celebrity crush be stalked by paparazzi for the rest of his or her life for not giving you an autograph. Some cultural insults border on the downright funny, as with the Japanese ‘’Tofu no kado ni atama wo butsuke shinjimae’’ (“Hit your head on a corner of tofu and die’’). You might hurl this insult at your celebrity crush for not giving you an autograph if the person is a vegetarian with a reputation for either bad luck or clumsiness.A few cultures are noted for their intolerance for the foibles of others. Yiddish, notably, has words for people who brag (‘’barimer’’), overeat (‘’fresser’’), are cheap (‘’karger’’), are clumsy (‘’klutz’’), are losers (‘’schlemiel’’), or always have bad luck (‘’schlemazel’’). Perhaps they simply like to ‘’kvetch’’ (whine).Sometimes, you can use the rules of a culture’s etiquette to your advantage to enhance the insult. German has two words for the singular “you”: the formal “Sie” and the casual “du.” It’s considered bad form to address someone as “du” before you get to know them well. Calling a stranger ‘’du Esel’’ is adding insult to insult., Directly attacking the recipient by name-calling is not always necessary to insult him or her. You can instead attack a person the recipient cares about or admires, put down or accomplishment the person is proud of or a skill the person is trying to master, mock a particular mannerism, or highlight something you find particularly annoying.   People who the recipient cares about are usually members of the person’s immediate family. One insult of this type is the “yo-momma” joke, where the insult describes how fat, lazy, ugly, old, poor, or stupid the recipient’s mother is supposed to be: “Yo momma so old, her prom date was a Neanderthal.” These jokes started to become popular in the 1990s; by the mid-2000s, MTV had built a show around them.Skills that are often targeted for insults include driving or cooking, as in “You treat me like a god. Everything you make is either a burnt offering or a sacrifice.” Similarly, the most effective insults targeting the recipient’s mannerisms are for those mannerisms the recipient is most self-conscious about or those he or she knows bother you most and are often delivered by exaggeratedly mimicking those mannerisms. Insulting the recipient’s accomplishments can be particularly biting if the recipient has put in a lot of time and effort into them. Imagine how writer S.J. Perelman felt after the publication of his first book, ‘’Dawn Ginsbergh’s Revenge’’, when Groucho Marx told him: “From the moment I picked your book up until I laid it down, I was convulsed with laughter. Someday I intend reading it.”, If you think the recipient is likely to take what you say the wrong way, you may want to soften your words by leading with something that sounds like an apology, such as “with all due respect” or “I’m not saying this to make you mad.”The danger with this approach is that your intended apology will probably not be seen as sincere once the recipient hears the insulting part of it, and claiming you’re not trying to make the person mad may actually anger him or her.  With this style of insult, you start off by saying something that sounds either neutral or positive, and then turn it into something demeaning to the recipient. This style is often used by comedians in their nightclub routines.   Groucho Marx was a master of this style of insult, with lines such as “I never forget a face, but in your case I’ll be glad to make an exception” and “I’ve had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn’t it.”If you decide to use this style of insult, pause shortly after your opening before you deliver your insulting follow-up, unless your insult is short, such as “I worship the ground that awaits you.”, Sometimes, you’re just too mad or too tired to preface your insult with either a pseudo-apology or an innocuous opening. In that case, just hit the recipient with your insult.   Ad hominem insults, or insults against the recipient as a person, are commonly delivered this way. They normally feature name-calling (“You idiot!”), but may also feature profanity or curt instructions as to where the recipient can go. Acts of incompetence can also be insulted this way, as in “Your cooking sucks.” This style works particularly well with made-up insult words, such as comedian Don Rickles’ famous “hockey puck.” (Rickles’ insults are delivered in an exaggerated “in-your-face” style that has earned him the nickname “Merchant of Venom.”)

 If you're going for the biggest bubbles, the gum you start with matters. You'll definitely want to use "stiffer", less sugary gum than you might normally chew. Bazooka gum is great for this — it's a little harder at first than the average bubble gum, but its rubbery texture makes for great bubbles. Sweeter, softer brands of gum contain lots of sugar and additives, which may taste great, but make for a softer, more fragile bubble.   You also may want to use more gum than normal. Try chewing two or even three pieces at once to make sure you have plenty of material handy for you bubble.  Start by chewing your gum and flattening against the top of your mouth as you normally would. When you start blowing, it's extra-important to keep a slow, even pace. The bigger your bubble gets, the more fragile it will get, so you'll need to hit that "sweet spot" between too fast and too slow to keep it inflated.          If you're really serious about blowing bubbles, you might want to learn a technique used by musicians of wind instruments called circular breathing. With this technique, you blow until you're almost of air, use your last bit of air to fill your cheeks, then push the air out with your cheeks as you breathe in through your nose.When done correctly, this allows you to blow more or less without ever stopping to inhale.  As you get better and better at blowing large bubbles, you'll eventually get to the point where the bubble starts to touch your chest. Because bubble gum can be especially hard to get out of clothing, you'll want to avoid this, so use the tips of your fingers to ever-so-carefully keep the growing bubble away from your body. Be gentle! The bubble will probably be quite fragile at this point, so a delicate touch is needed.   If you do get gum on your clothing, don't worry! You can get gum off of clothing by freezing it or rubbing it with a bag of ice cubes until it hardens, then scraping it off with a knife or your fingernails. Alternatively, you can try applying white vinegar directly to the gum to soften it up. This works well when the gum has already been worked into the fibers of the clothing., Huge bubbles aren't the sort of thing you'll be able to get overnight. The world's biggest bubble-blowers take years to get their skills to the point where they're recognized for their talent. The best way to get good at blowing huge bubbles is to try to do it, so go buy yourself a pack of gum today!          Don't give up! With lots of practice, you can become a champion bubble gum blower. The current Guinness World Record for the largest bubble gum bubble ever blown (without using hands) currently stands at 20 inches (50.8 centimeters) in diameter. 

use the right gum.  use slow, even blowing.  use your hands to support huge bubbles.  practice!

 Regular breast self-examinations are not a reliable way to detect early signs of breast cancer. However, they are still a useful tool for understanding the normal condition of your breasts, and in some cases can help you detect changes that may be linked to breast cancer or other conditions.Ask your doctor to demonstrate the proper way to conduct a breast exam, and what to look and feel for during the exam. To perform the exam, hold your right arm above your head and gently feel your right breast and nipple area with your left hand. Move around your breast in a circular pattern with your fingers. Feel for any lumps or tissue that seems irregular compared to the rest of your breast tissue. Repeat the process and examine your left breast.  Look for bulges, lopsidedness, or any dimpling that may occur when you raise your arm above your head.  If you menstruate, be aware of normal changes in your breasts that are related to your menstrual cycle. Try to perform your regular breast exams at a time when your breasts are not tender or enlarged due to menstruation or pre-menstrual symptoms.  If you notice any changes or symptoms that you find worrisome, contact your doctor, even if you aren’t due for your regular exam.  During your regular check-up, your doctor will perform a breast examination, during which they will check for breast tissue irregularities. If you have noticed any lumps or bumps, let your doctor know.  In general, doctors recommend regular mammograms for women 40 years of age and older. Early detection is possible through mammograms and can assist in the diagnosis of breast cancer sooner in order to start effective treatment.Women at high risk for developing breast cancer may need to start getting mammograms at a younger age. Depending on your lifestyle and family history, your doctor may recommend a mammogram annually or at some other interval. Since men rarely develop breast cancer, doctors do not typically recommend mammograms for men. However, if you are a man experiencing possible breast cancer symptoms, such as a lump in your breast, your doctor may wish to perform a mammogram as part of your diagnostic exam. 

perform a self-examination at least once a month.  visually examine your breasts.  familiarize yourself with how your breasts change during the month.  get an evaluation if you have concerns.  visit your physician annually for a check-up.  get a mammogram regularly. 

 Start with dry hair. Brush through it to ensure it’s tangle-free. Lift the hair at the top of your head and use a pick or comb to lightly tease it at the roots. This will soften up the style and provide a little volume.         Use a volumizing powder or dry shampoo to create additional volume, if desired.  Start on the left side. Use your fingers to separate one chunk of your hair at the crown of your head. Then separate another chunk, approximately the same size as the first, right above your ear. Loosely braid both pieces and secure the ends together with a clear hair elastic.  Then secure both sides of double-braids together with a single elastic at the back of your head. Make sure you secure them loosely. The braids should drape rather than pull.  Hold the low ponytail in place with your hand, but do not secure it with an elastic. Use your other hand to gather the ends together and pull them up. Loop all of your hair around and tuck the ends down between the braids to create a loose bun. Pull the ends through and secure them in place with bobby pins.         For a slightly different look, create a very loose angled braid with your remaining hair, then loop it around to create the bun.  If any areas feel loose, use a few more bobby pins underneath the bun to hold everything in place. Pull out a few face-framing pieces to soften up the overall look. Mist your entire head with hairspray.        

create volume by teasing your hair at the crown.  braid two sections of hair on each side of your head.  repeat the exact same actions on the right side.  gather your remaining hair into a loose low ponytail.  set the style with hairspray.

 Try building a chicken coop or shed, living in a yurt or in the outdoors, capturing solar power for cooking and finding food and water by foraging, etc. Teaching them how to do things rather than how to buy things will be one of the most useful and thoughtful gifts of punk philosophy that you can pass on.   Grow a garden. If you lack the space, go guerrilla gardening or join a community garden. Teach your kids how growing their own food helps them to know where it comes from, what it contains and helps them to remain independent of the grid. Teach independence in chores and responsibilities early on. Doing everything for your kids teaches them to feel entitled rather than capable. As soon as your child is old enough to do things on his or her own, encourage it. Show how to wash dishes and clothes, clean the house, mend clothing and all of the daily necessary things, then build expectations that your child will do his or her own chores from that point on. Obsolescence-proof your kids. As far as you're able, teach kids how to life hack everything from the motherboard to the vacuum cleaner. Being able to fix things that break, to re-engineer things that get overtaken by technology and to make completely new things from scratch will give your kids a sense of strength in an ever-changing world.; , In fact, they might even goad you into telling them off once in a while, just to see if you care enough to set limits. That's okay––set a few simple ones and always be there for them when they need you.  While anarchy may reign supreme in the credo of a punk, anarchy in the household is rather less helpful. Having systems in place to remain organized, from cleaning clothes and bed linen to preparing the kids' lunches is essential for keeping on top of everything that child raising entails. If you haven't already discovered this, cease your resistance to household systems, for these will restore calm and precious time in your life, freeing you up to pursue more exciting things that you love, like punk rock.  Don't be bothered when your kids tell you it's weird music and they'd rather not hear it, or they prefer Justin Bieber. And even though you may recall the time your best friend had his teeth kicked in during this great Black Flag song, be ready for your teen to think it blows. Your kids are individuals with their own taste. It may take time to win them over unless you've had punk rock blaring in the background since their birth (a great method because Justin Bieber is the subliminal teaching tool of the commercial media -"you gotta serve somebody"). In turn, be ready to appreciate their music taste too, without your sarcastic commentary!   Find out if any of your kids’ favorite bands were inspired by one of your former punk bands. As with most musical cycling, many of the emerging bands (both non-punk and punk) today have been inspired by a punk band from the past. If you discover this, it's a great way to point out how your kid's favorite band was inspired by one of your favorite bands.  While instilling the ever essential need to beware any possible stranger danger, teach your children ways to balance their initial gut reactions with a willingness to get to know a person properly. Some of the punk-based lessons you might be able to share with your kids include:   Show them how creative people of all types like to push the appearance of boundaries for specific reasons that have nothing to do with fear or spite. Sometimes it's about challenging the less tolerant elements in society; other times it's about self-expression and being open to all the possibilities by keeping an open mind. In some cases, it's a deliberate poke at societal ideas of beauty, while in many cases it's simply about having fun and doing things differently. Explore difference with your children, using your punk experience. Explain that punks have often frightened others by their appearance alone, with their piercings, tattoos, ripped clothing and brightly colored spiked hair. Explain how some people choose to interpret this as "bad" or "deviant". This can then lead you into a discussion about why people might be frightened by mere appearance (for older children, you can also explore the implications of the philosophies held by punks). Hopefully, if your kids have a brain, they will have picked up all this stuff from you already. They should be happy playing with mud, and dry chicken bones, as artistic choices come in many different shapes and forms. For many punks, looking distinct is a story of creativity, boundary-pushing and challenging assumptions Yet, for others, such as the LAST OF THE TRUE ROCK N' ROLLERS, GG ALLIN, it was not a costume or behavior, but his way, the way he was, like an alien from another planet, or a strange mutant naked animal, who lived off violence, and had a sense of humor in the vein of Andy Kaufman. You might like to highlight how challenging conformity through appearance, actions and words can often cause fearful or uncertain people to feel threatened because they might either be upset that others have the pluck to self-express while they've spent their whole lives conforming or they may be jealous or fearful of what would happen if things changed too much from what they know. Don't sugarcoat anything. Punk culture is, in reality DARK! That is something that can be explored with your kids, but above all DO NOT TELL FUCKING LIES! that is what our work-a-day world (the rat race) already does.  While the green hair and black nail polish may have been "very you" in the nineteen eighties, the reality is that trying to relive the past by way of clothing, makeup and hairstyles is often a self-defeating action. Rather than clinging on to the past, find ways to look punk that fit your age and lifestyle now––there are plenty of cool quirks you can get away with that flatter your age and still denote a lack of conformity to the expected. For example, not wearing a tie, wearing brightly colored shirts, wearing women's clothing UNDER your rat-race monkey suit, dying your hair in interestingly creative ways rather than dramatic ones (use beet juice, or blood obtained from the local butcher for red, grind fresh cut grass for a green pigment) and wearing cool shoes made by a local craftsperson (unless you are poor, then go to the Salvation Army, and get them for free) These are just some possible ways to punk out & up your gear without letting yourself down.   Be aware that parents can embarrass their kids easily by how they dress. However, if you've done a good job of teaching them tolerance and acceptance, this will hopefully be less of an issue. If you still wear a mohawk at 50, give your kids a chance to express their feelings and be open to discussing the reasons for your choice. Ultimately, while it's important to give consideration to how your kids might feel about your outward punk expression, this is another lesson for them in being understanding and accepting. Be careful to avoid wearing anything that could harm a child. Accidentally knocking your baby with a stud wristband while wrestling with the diapers on the change table is not a good outcome.  Grown-up realities like mortgages and daily work can either be something you groan about or you reach acceptance about. Acceptance doesn't mean giving up––it means finding ways to make your current reality less onerous, more cheerful and one that works best for you. And if you can't reach acceptance, find an alternative like freelancing, renting, living off-the-grid, etc., while still making sure that your kids are getting a decent, healthy upbringing. Whatever you choose, help your children to see that life has meaningful purpose.   Parents who keep trying to "stick-it-to-the-man" risk teaching children more about anger and staying stuck than about being free unless you action your words and be that entrepreneur, business owner or free spirit you'd prefer to be. Teach them that an angry rebel, is only useful when controlled by someone who is smarter. There are many ways to subvert the negative aspects of our flawed system, JUST DO NOT GET CAUGHT! Show your children more personally satisfying ways to live than complaining and running away. STAY AND FIGHT! The people who have resigned their lives to the robotic rat-race horror A.K.A. The American Nightmare, have given up, and given in. Stand your ground, or you are no better than the conformists who hate who you are! Be strong, and have FUN!!!  

teach as many resourcefulness and diy skills as you can to your kids.  be conscious that your kids and teens may not experience rebellious moments, especially if you're a permissive and tolerant type.  calm the anarchy.  don't force punk rock on your kids.  use your punk roots to teach your children valuable lessons about not judging people too quickly.  wear your punk self in ways that fit your current lifestyle and parenting role.  come to peace with some of the nasty necessities of life, or find viable alternatives (welfare or ssi).

Slowly move back as far as possible in each direction.  Before doing any stroke recovery exercises, it is recommended by physicians to treat the symptoms of spasticity first.   Spasticity causes tightening of the muscles, inability to stretch, aching or sharp pain, abnormality in posture and uncontrollable movement. Spasticity is usually caused by damage to the portion of the brain (as a result of insufficient blood supply) or spinal cord that controls voluntary movement. The affected body part can start to regain its normal strength and range of motion if the medications given to the patient relieve spasticity.  This medication acts on the central nervous system. It relaxes muscles by decreasing muscle spasms, tightness, and pain and improves range of motion.   For adults, the maintenance dose of Baclofen is 40-80 mg/day in 4 divided doses.  This medication blocks the nerve impulses in the brain that cause spasticity.   The effectiveness of the medication lasts only for a short period of time, so it is advisable to use it only when needed for relief of extreme discomfort or when it's needed to complete certain activities. The ideal starting dose is 4 mg every 6 to 8 hours. The maintenance dose is 8 mg every 6 to 8 hours (drugs.com).  This medication acts on the central nervous system, relaxing the muscles and decreasing spasticity for a short period of time.   The oral dosage varies as Benzodiazepines comes in many generic names. Consult with your doctor for proper prescription.  This medication blocks signals that make muscles contract and reduce muscle tone.   The recommended dose ranges from 25 mg to a maximum dosage of 100 mg three times a day.  A botox injection attaches to the nerve endings and blocks the release of chemical transmitters which signal the brain to activate muscle contraction. This prevents muscle spasm.   The maximum dosage of botox is less than 500 units per visit. Botox is given by injection directly into the affected muscles.  Phenol destroys the nerve conduction that is causing spasticity. It is given by injection directly into the affected muscles or into the spine.   The dosage may vary according to the manufacturer. Consult with your doctor for proper prescription.  Stroke recovery exercises minimize the formation of blood clots by improving blood flow to the different parts of the body. It also prevents the occurrence of muscle atrophy (a condition wherein the muscles break down, become weak and decrease in size).   For stroke patients, muscle atrophy is common because the affected area is not used very often and stays immobile for a long time. Physical inactivity is the major cause of muscle atrophy. Exercises and muscle movements promote good blood circulation and oxygen distribution to the affected area, thus speeding up the repair of the damaged tissue.  Exercising the affected body part through pulling, pushing or lifting stimulates growth of the muscles and increases their efficiency.   Regular ankle exercise increases the number of myofibrils (muscle fibers) in each cell. These fibers account for 20 to 30 percent of muscle growth. Because of the increased blood flow, the muscle fibers are being supplied with more oxygen and nutrients leading to an increase in muscle mass.  Because of the increased blood flow, the muscles increase their mass as a result of the extra oxygen and nutrients they receive. An increase in muscle mass also increases muscle strength.  Weight-bearing physical activity causes new bone tissue to form, and this makes bones stronger.  When you exercise, the ligaments and tendons (which are comprised of collagen fibers, or semi-elastic protein), are being stretched.   Regular stretching of the ligaments and tendons helps maintain flexibility of the joints. Loss of flexibility decreases the range of motion of the joints. This means that the extent and type of movement are reduced. Inability to fully move the joints restricts the activities of daily living and causes your muscles and bones to lose mass and strength.

 Start talking to the dog before moving toward it. Use a soft, soothing voice that will be comforting to the dog. Shouting or using a loud, firm voice could intimidate the dog, making it uncomfortable or scared.   Keep talking to the dog in this manner the whole time you are trying to help it.; , As you approach, keep your body turned slightly away from the dog so that you are not towering over it. Towering above the dog can be scary for it and may cause it to act aggressively in defense.If possible, stay low to the ground as you approach so that you appear as less of a threat to the dog.  Do not run up to the dog, as this might frighten it and cause it to try to run away. Instead, make slow, steady movements. Stop when you are about one foot away from the injured dog., Make a loose fist with one of your hands. Keeping your knuckles pointed up, slowly extend your closed hand toward the dog. Depending on the dog’s reaction to your hand, do one of the following:   If the dog struggles, growls, or makes another act of aggression, retract your hand. Continue to talk softly to the dog for another minute or so, then reach your hand out again. You may need to do this several times before the dog begins to trust you. If the dog shows no signs of aggression, pet it gently with your closed hand. Continue talking softly to the dog while you pet it., If you’ve tried to approach the dog by following the steps above, but the dog is still being very aggressive, it may not be safe for you to try and help the dog. If you feel the dog will bite you if you continue to approach, slowly back away. Call animal control to assist in rescuing the dog.   You should also call animal control if the dog has run away from the scene. They can help track down and safely capture the dog. 

speak softly to the dog.  turn your body slightly away from the dog.  move slowly.  extend a closed hand toward the dog.  determine if the dog is too aggressive to approach. 

 This will help you to balance what you saw with the realities that it was all made up, props were used and actors simply spoke lines. This section explores a few ways to turn the movie into "just another day in the job of those who made it"!; , Look up some head shots of some of the cast looking normal (no crazy costumes).  Search for an interview with one of the main characters or one of the scary guys.  They usually aren't famous considering they wear masks and make noises the whole time. This means that they usually have small parts in other films and shows. A serial killer is never scary when the role before that was a cashier in a low-budget comedy.  Most actors and actresses use horror films as a stepping stone into action, comedy, drama, etc. Go to IMDB.com and search for the movie you saw, once you click it, find some of the scary characters and click on their actor's names. Find some lighthearted films on their bio page and go rent them. For example, Adam from Saw and Saw III, was in the romantic comedy, The Referees.  Do an online search for the movie's title along with "behind the scenes" and you'll usually get a 5 minute video going on a tour with one of the main characters.  Some movies even go as far as having videos of the actors getting their make-up on.  Trivia of the movie is usually interesting. For example, did you know that Starbucks refused to be mentioned in Dawn of the Dead? Use the trivia to make the horror scenes much more trivial.  People go there to tear apart movies they saw. Most of these reviews are hilarious in nature and make the movies seem quite silly; this might be useful for feeling less taken in by the movie you watched.  If the movie won any awards, look for the acceptance speeches of the people, it's like an interview and seeing them all happy crying is a great chance to get to know them.  Look up goofs in the movie on IMDB, for example, in The Hills Have Eyes, "at the beginning of the movie, after the title sequence and during a long crane shot toward the gas station, the film crew can be seen in a reflection on the green car's windows." To find goofs for the movie, search for the movie on IMDb.com, click the search result, and then scroll down past the cast and crew, to where it says "Goofs". Then click, "More". Every movie has a ton and it will make the movie seem laughable. To make this even more effective, see the movie again and look for the mistakes. If you don't want to see the whole movie again, go to YouTube, Google video, Metacafe, etc, and search for "goofs]".  Most movies have gag reels which have the cast screwing up and laughing during suspenseful scenes. For example, "Silence of the Lambs gag reel" brought up a video of people laughing, dancing, and ab libbing funny lines during takes. Just use Google and search for it.  Most horror films reference funny movies, such as One Missed Call has a girl explaining the drama Beloved's plot to someone.  Again, under Movie Connections, movies are usually referenced in comedies and made fun of. Besides, Scary Movies 1, 2, 3, and 4, Saturday Night Live has done a lot of parodies of scary movies. Look under Movie Connections> Referenced In/Spoofed In. Also, search on YouTube for fan-made parodies of the movie which are usually hilarious.  Under Fun Stuff on the movie's IMDB.com page, click on quotes, most horror films have some seriously funny quotes. For example in One Missed Call, Beth Raymond says, "How was it?", Leann Cole, "It was a funeral, it sucked. From now on I don't go to parties where someone gets cremated."  , Now that you know what is coming up, make fun of it the whole way through. The more ridicule, the better.  This can help you to forget the horror and replace it with really funny things. Be sure to find something that is really hilarious though; it needs to totally counteract what you just watched. This might help you to relax and sleep better.   It's probably a good idea to stay away from black comedies straight after a horror movie.  This won't be easy but practice it anyway. Letting go of horrible images that aren't real is possible with repeated attempts, so keep at it.  

look for ways that turn the fearful images back into "just a movie".  get to know the cast.  find interviews of the actors.  look up the movie on imdb.com, find one of the people who play a scary role, and look on their bio page.  look for different genre movies using some of those actors.  go behind the scenes.  look for explanations about how the movie makers did the make-up and costumes.  look for trivia.  look at negative reviews rottentomatoes.com is a mostly negative-review based site of movies.  watch the awards shows.  look up the movie's goofs.  check out the gag reel.  under "fun stuff" at the bottom of the movie's imdb.com page, look under movie connections.  watch parodies.  look for funny quotes.  consider rewatching the movie in broad daylight with goofy friends.  watch a comedy right after the horror movie.  forget the movie, it's just a mindset. 

 Your regular clothes don't count. Be creative with the costume you choose and make sure it looks great on you.; , Don't go alone.  If there are no lights on, however, skip that particular house. That means there's nobody home or no candy to be handed out.  You should receive the candy.  after they hand you the candy. If you don't, they might think you're greedy. This may not bother you, but it might decrease your chances of getting any from them next year.  Don't keep saying the same thing over and over again every year. Improvise!       If there is no one home, but there is a bowl of candy, take the whole entire basket. Be as sneaky as you can.  If there's no candy you like in the bowl, take a piece to trade later. , If you're sleeping over with somebody, expect a crash and a candy hangover, though it'll be worth it!  , 

purchase or make a costume.  convince some friends to go with you.  go to a door.  say, "trick-or-treat" with a nice smile.  say, "thank you, happy halloween!",  if they let you pick your candy, make sure it's a candy you like.  go to next house and repeat steps 3-7 until the entire neighborhood is canvased, or you're exhausted.  ,  go home, dump all your candy on the floor, count it, and enjoy!,  wait until next year, dreaming of sugary goodness...  

 Say this at the beginning of a meal to express gratitude to your host or to the cook.   A more literal translation of this phrase would be "I will eat well." While "thanks" is not an official part of the phrase, the use of this phrase does express gratitude for the food you are about to eat. Pronounce this phrase as jhal-moog-get-soom-nee-da. The beginning syllable sounds similar to a soft "ch" sound. The Hangul for the phrase is 잘 먹겠습니다. Use “jal mug gut sum ni da” at the end of a meal. The only difference is that the get (겠) syllable in the original phrase is changed to gut (었). As a result, the meaning becomes “I ate well” instead of “I will eat well.”  

thank someone for a meal with "jal mug get sum ni da." 

 If possible, do physical activity before you study. Go for a jog before you sit down to study for a test or go over your class notes. Hit the gym on the way home to swim some laps so you are ready to study that evening.Doing aerobic activity gets blood, oxygen, and nutrients to your brain, which helps your brain function better.; , A few studies have shown that performing light exercise while studying can help recall of information. If you are going to exercise while studying, just make sure to keep it gentle.These studies found that vigorous exercise while studying may hurt recall because your brain is focused on the workout instead of the information. To try this, take your textbook or notes to the gym. Use the stationary bike while you study for at least half an hour, making sure to keep the intensity light and gentle. You can also use an elliptical, treadmill, or stairclimber., Studies have shown that exercising before and while you study are not the only times that benefit your recall and mental processing. Working out after a study session can also help boost your mental function and improve your studying.Go for a walk or even lift weights after you study to help your brain stay active so your studying can pay off.  If you are studying in the library, break up your study sessions with physical activity. Get up and take a fifteen-minute stroll around the building or around campus nearby.You can also do this if you are studying in your dorm or a coffee shop. Taking a break helps refresh yourself and gets blood flowing to the brain, which can help you think and remember better.  You can get your blood pumping at your desk while you study. If you don’t want to leave everything and go for a quick 15 minute stroll, try getting some physical activity in where you are.Do some chair squats at your desk. Stand up from your chair, then squat down without sitting down. Hover just above the chair for about 10 seconds. Repeat this 20 times.Try wall sitting. Lean against the wall and slowly lower yourself into a squat position, using the wall to support your back. Hold for as long as you can, or do 20 sets while holding for 10 seconds each. You may also wish to lift one leg as you hold the squat for an extra challenge. Use resistance bands while you sit there and study. Put one in each hand and pull on them for an upper body workout. You can also try holding hand weights and doing bicep curls while studying.  

exercise just before you study.  try light exercise while you study.  go to the gym right after studying.  take a walk around the library.  exercise at your desk.

 If you are someone who likes the look of clean lines, white towels may be for you. White towels call to mind the look and feel of a hotel or spa bathroom, and they’ll go perfectly with any bathroom or preexisting décor.Light colored towels last longer and do not fade as obviously as darker colored towels do. If your bathroom is already neutral, avoid white towels.; , If your bathroom is currently neutral, colored towels are the easiest way to add visual interest. And because there are so many shades available, you don't have to tie yourself down to just one color.Create an ombre effect with your bathroom towels by buying different sized towels in various shades of the same color. Buy your largest towels in the darkest shade and lighten the shade as the size of your towels decrease. If your bathroom is already brightly colored, gravitate towards more neutral towel colors.  Patterned towels show a great deal of color interest and are a great way to tie the different shades of your bathroom together. Look for tones that already exist in your bathroom and try to find a towel that infuses those color tones into the towel’s pattern.If you have a tile floor, look to mirror the tile’s color in your patterned towels. If you already have a heavily patterned shower curtain, steer away from using additional patterns in your towels.  Layering patterns within your towels is a cool and easy way to make your towel display look more textured. Start off with a basic white bath towel with a colored accent, like stripes. Add an accent hand towel and top the whole thing off with a monogrammed washcloth.Monograms are an easy and classy way to lend some sophistication to a bathroom. The more high quality your towels are, the more impressive your pattern mixing will look. Mix polka dots with stripes for a preppy vibe. Alternate chevron with stripes for a more modern look.  Floral towels aren’t just for your grandmother’s bathroom; they’re also a great way to infuse your bathroom with a country-chic style. Set floral towels against solid towels to give your bathroom a vintage throwback feel.Do not mix floral patterns, as this will prove visually overwhelming. Buy floral hand towels and set them against larger bathroom linens in a pale pink or ivory tone.  

choose white towels.  choose colored towels.  look for fun patterns.  mix patterns within your towels.  embrace floral towels. 

 For those who must work in sub-zero temperatures and take the laptop or computer with them, it is important to buy one that fits the bill. Biologists tracking caribou trails need a laptop that can stand the rigors of temperature changes, along with quite a few knocks. Ask your local computer specialist for advice. Many times, the laptop or computer will need to be specially modified to cope.; , Keep your laptop in this inner sleeve at all times that you are not using it. If you need it, take it out and fire it up, use it and then return it to its cozy little bag to retain heat. If you have a pet dog, tuck the laptop under the dog where it is sitting as this will help keep it warm. Failing that, use the car heater zone, or the tent heating zone to keep it in a warmer part of your operations.  Something made from a fire blanket might be a good option provided that is non-flammable (they are supposed to be). You will need to make absolutely sure that the material is non-flammable and it must be cut away from any vent areas of the laptop or computer to allow it to remove any heat build-up (ironically this will still occur despite the cold, as that is the nature of computing hardware).  Even if you are not an intrepid explorer or a poorly paid biologist on a field trip way up North or way down South, you need to take good care of a laptop or computer being transported in your vehicle during cold weather., If you need to use it en route, only turn it on inside the car with the heating on so that it is in room temperature environment., For computers, just make sure they are well wrapped for both warmth and damage-proofing so that it reaches its destination in good condition.,, 

buy the right equipment.  purchase a slim fitting, quilted, padded cover.  consider making a special cover for the laptop or computer that can be "worn" during use.  keep the laptop or computer well-wrapped during travel.  keep a laptop snug in a cover (as described above), then place it in its carry-bag and - if you can - slip it into a backpack for additional warmth.  avoid taking it out of the car into a sudden drastic change of temperature.given that you are less likely to use it, don't try to use it in a freezing cold hotel room; wait until the room and the computer warms up first before switching it on.  ditto for when you arrive at your final destination - give the computer time to temperature settle before powering it up.  

 The symptoms of Hepatitis A can be mild, lasting one to two weeks, to severe, lasting several months. Symptoms can also be non-existent (especially in the young children under six years of age), or they can more severe, especially in adults. There are risk factors that make some people much more likely to contract Hepatitis A than others. Know your risk factors and be better able to recognize Hepatitis A.  Those who live in or travel to Africa, Asia, Central or South America, or Eastern Europe are most likely to come in contact with Hepatitis A, where there is intermediate to high prevalence of the virus. Therefore, if you plan to travel to the areas of the world where Hep A is endemic, get vaccinated. Two doses spaced six to 12 months apart are required. You can contract the illness even if you use good hygiene and stay in fancy hotels., Hepatitis A is contracted through person-to-person contact or by ingesting contaminated food or water.You are at higher risk and should inform your doctor if:   You live with or take care of someone with Hepatitis A, or adopted a child from a country with high incidence of the illness. You are a man who has sexual contact with other men. You use illegal drugs, injected or not. You have a clotting-factor disorder such as hemophilia. You have sexual contact with someone who has Hepatitis A.Your work puts you at risk for contact, such as a research lab or healthcare professional. 

understand which risk factors matter for you.  know where it’s risky to travel.  tell your doctor if you’re in a high-risk group. 

 Wet hair and hot appliances don't mix; this should be common knowledge, but many people try straightening damp hair - which is just as dangerous. Want to boil your hair? No, didn't think so.       ; , Serums are usually best as they get right into your hair, though if you know of a quality spray you can try that. Make sure it's a good quality protector. Rub it all over your hair and give your hair time to absorb it, making sure it's applied evenly.  Only choose a heat you absolutely need. For people with straight or loosely wavy hair, you do not really need to heat your straightener up to 200 degrees - 180, 150, around that area should do the job. Only people with very frizzy, thick curly hair should go right up to 200 degrees.  The slower you go the faster it will get straightened, meaning you don't have to go over it endless times and break the hair shaft. Try not to go over each section of hair more than 5 times. If you want to do it the most effectively, don't just smooth the straightener over the chunk of hair-clamp it onto the top portion of that chunk/strand, count slowly to ten or fifteen seconds, then move it down until you get to the ends. It takes longer but is way more effective especially if your straightener is small or old.  A straightening serum/spray will do the trick too, as will non frizz products. The more you work to keeping your hair straight longer, the less times you have to straighten and damage it.  As an apology for drying it out, make sure your hair gets a regular dosage of the moisture it craves. You don't have to buy expensive products. Olive oil can be heated up and massaged into the hair easily, and is renowned for its ability to strengthen the shine and moisture of hair. There are also tons of home made remedies available on the net.  This will prevent split ends - a common issue when straightening - from getting any worse. It also gets rid of damaged ends, the part which gets dried out the most.  This allows the product to seep into your hair and really give it the treatment and moisture it craves from straightening damage.         

make sure your hair is completely dry.  get a reliable heat protector.  heat the straightener up.  start at the roots and move slowly down.  apply gel or hairspray to keep your hair in tact.  deep condition your hair weekly.  trim every six weeks.  when you apply your conditioner in the shower, massage it in, pop a shower cap on and leave it while you wash.

 As with any project, it’s important to have the right tools needed to complete the job. You will be sawing and cutting wood, as well as securing the air conditioning into place. So you will need quite a variety of tools for this job.For this project, you’ll need a saw, hammer, nails, and an old shed or other doghouse structure.  It can be quite unsafe for your dog if you attempt to install an air conditioner in a small doghouse. So it is a better idea to air condition a more stable structure instead.Consider installing an air conditioning unit inside an existing shed in your yard. This will be a safer way to help keep your dog cool in the summer.  For the doghouse project, a small window unit is probably your best option. Try to find a nice used one (on Craigslist or in the newspaper classifieds), or go to an appliance store to buy a new one.   You can usually find a nice, small air conditioning window unit for less than $200.If you don’t want to cut into the side of the doghouse, you could consider getting a portable air conditioning unit. However, you’d have to consider how to keep it from being overexposed to the elements by covering it.  Keep the air conditioning unit (along with all related plugs, cords, and electrical outlets) out of your dog’s reach. You don’t want your dog to gnaw on the cords and get electrocuted, or for the air conditioner to short out because it got rained on.   You might also consider insulating the doghouse to add an extra measure of protection from the elements. This will help the doghouse maintain its cool interior during the summer months.  Just as you would to make room for any window air conditioning unit, cut a hole in the side of the shed. Saw a square hole where the air conditioner will go on the back side of the shed.You may want to use a pencil to trace the outline of the air conditioner onto the wood so that you know exactly where to cut to make a hole that is the correct size.  After you have sawed the square, take the air conditioner and put it in the square. Carefully slide the air conditioner into the open space, making sure to avoid scraping the edges. And you don’t want to push the air conditioner too far into the shed. Make sure the front of the unit is fully inserted and then stop.Use the accordion side panels on the window unit to adjust the unit more closely to the size of the hole. This will help it stay in place more securely. Use the securing brackets that came with the air conditioning unit to firmly mount the unit in place. If the unit didn't come with mounting brackets, purchase or fashion a support system that will hold the air conditioner securely in place. You’ll need to use a screwdriver and/or hammer and nails to mount the safety brackets to the wall and to the unit.  

get the necessary tools.  choose the doghouse.  purchase a small air conditioning unit.  make sure the doghouse is safe.  cut a hole for the air conditioner.  install the air conditioner. 

 This is simple once you know how, but it can take a while to get the knack. The psi ball is created by moving psi energy into a desired location in the form of a small sphere. For some, the standard psi ball is a little bigger than a baseball, and smaller than a softball. However, they can be made quite large - to fit around the body in the case of a shield, or even bigger than that.  You can use one hand or two, you can hold them vertically or horizontally. Just do what feels right. Make sure you don't get your hands in a position so that it makes you tired and makes you get all shaky because of strain. Some people find it a bit harder to feel the psi if the fingers are touching.  Visualize psi in your solar plexus. The solar plexus is the point where your lower ribs meet in the middle; place your hand on your stomach and your pinky touching the top of your belly button. This is the area you are going to want to use. There are many impressions of what psi looks like, such as water, fire, light... Choose the one that seems right to you. Imagine it in your sternum moving around slowly, and attempt to feel your solar plexus while visualizing this. There is a major chakra located here.  Visualize it slowly moving up, going up your chest and over to your shoulders. Try to feel it while doing so. Have it go down to your arms, and to your hands, have it pool there for a little. Bring it back up, and then back to your sternum. Do this a few times, until you start to get the hang of it.  Pull psi from your solar plexus. When you get to your hands, instead of letting it pool, have it flow out of your palms and shape into a hollow sphere. This sphere is what you are going to use as a shell.  This means projecting your intentions into the psi ball, to control its behaviour. Basic programming should be to maintain the psi on the inside, and to keep it in one location instead of having if fly every which direction. After you have successfully created a shell, you will want to fill it in; allow the psi to flow into the shell. Your psi ball is ready.  Move it just like you moved the psi from your solar plexus. This time it won't be in your body, though. This can take practice; you will get better.  There are many ways to make psi balls, some people have much better success with doing it a certain way. The principles of it are the same; locate your "energy" source, move the psi, then put the psi into an area and use what "energy" you have to create the psi ball.  Create the psi ball the size of a beach ball, then when you feel you're ready compress it down into a smaller, denser ball. A lot of people seem to have good results with this.  

learn to move psi.  position your hands.  feel the psi flowing.  move the psi.  make a shell.  program the ball and fill it in.  move your psi ball.  experiment with other methods.  experiment with compression. 

 You can do so either by clicking the Windows logo in the bottom-left corner of the screen, or by pressing the ⊞ Win key.  The search bar is at the bottom of the Start menu.

 Smoking can compromise your immune system, and being around secondhand smoke can affect your child's immune system. If you or someone in your family smokes, make sure to keep the smoke out of your home., Your child needs sleep to keep their immune system functioning properly. Without enough sleep, your child is more likely to get sick more readily.The amount of sleep a child needs varies by age, so make sure your child is getting enough sleep for their age group.Newborns should get 14 to 17 hours, while infants need 12 to 15 hours. Toddlers do best on 11 to 14 hours, while preschoolers do just fine on 10 to 13 hours. Once your child reaches age 6, 9 to 11 hours is enough, until they are about 14. At 14, they do just fine on 8 to 10 hours. Over 17, 7 to 9 hours is fine, just like adults., Daycare is a breeding ground for diseases and germs. Your child is more likely to catch viruses and other infections if they attend daycare than if they stay home.

 If you are anxious or uncertain about whether or not it is the right decision to break up with the married man, it may help to make a list of the reasons why the relationship is not working. You may feel it is time to end the relationship due to frustration with his inability to leave his wife, guilt due to his constant lying to you and to his family, or anger at being “the other woman”. It can help to remind yourself of the reasons why it may be time to end the affair as you prepare to have the break up conversation with the married man.   Many married men who have affairs will offer very similar excuses as to why they are cheating on their spouse and why they cannot leave their spouse. For example, “I haven’t divorced her because of the children,” “I don’t love her anymore and I don’t think I ever did”, or “We don’t sleep together and haven’t for a very long time”.Though you may have believed these excuses when you first became involved with the married man, over time you may get tired of hearing these excuses and be frustrated that the married man seems incapable of leaving his spouse, even when he claims to be unhappy or unfulfilled. It will likely be up to you to end the relationship, as the married man may be content to string you along and continue to use the same excuses.; , Though you may not want to tell your family or close friends about the affair, you can lean on them for support in other ways. Spending quality time with family and friends, away from the married man, can help you gain perspective on the relationship and remind yourself that you have other meaningful relationships in your life besides the affair.   If you do have a family member or friend you feel you can confide in, talk to them about your feelings around the affair and your decision to end it. Sometimes expressing your emotions and feelings to a sympathetic ear can help you figure out the motivations behind your decision and feel you have support in your decision to walk away from the relationship. If you do not feel comfortable sharing your feelings with anyone, you can write down your thoughts in a journal or a diary. Working through your emotions on the page may help to prepare you for the break up conversation and give you an outlet to vent about the relationship.  It’s important that you prepare yourself in active ways by re focusing on your needs and your priorities. Practice self care by eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and getting eight to nine hours of sleep a night. You can also take up stress-management techniques like yoga or meditation. Taking good care of yourself will help you to move on from the relationship after the break up, both physically and mentally.  Rather than devote your time to analyzing what went wrong with the relationship, focus on a new hobby or passion, or on developing stronger skills at your job. Prioritizing your career and your well being over the needs of the married man can help you to feel empowered and stable on your own.  The break up conversation will likely be intense and difficult so set the scene by choosing a time and place where you can be alone and talk in private. This could be a quiet bench in a park or a private spot in a coffee shop. Choose a location that feels neutral and secluded enough to give you both space to talk and listen.  Because you are the one instigating the break up, you will need to take charge of the conversation and be clear about your intentions. Try to keep your voice calm and controlled, as getting emotionally may signal to the married man that he can try to comfort you and avoid the break up conversation. Using a calm and clear tone will make it apparent that you are serious about your desire to end the relationship.   For example, you may begin by telling the married man you need to discuss your relationship and your unhappiness or discomfort with the situation. "I would like to talk to you about our relationship. I am not happy with our relationship and I think we need to address the status of our relationship."  , To ensure you are understood clearly by the married man, focus on “I” statements, such as: “I feel that you are not committed to our relationship and I am not comfortable being the other woman,” or “I think we should end our affair. I am tired of all the lying and sneaking around.”   At this point, the married man may try to persuade you to change your mind or use excuses he has used in the past. Resist this by providing reasons why you think it is time to end the relationship and by being clear that you have made your decision. Using “I” statements will show you are being accountable for your decision and are expressing your feelings without blaming or accusing the married man. This will keep the conversation controlled and prevent it from devolving into a shouting match.  Once you have stated your intentions to end the relationship, be firm about your decision by rejecting any excuses the married man may use and walking away if he tries to persuade you to change your mind.  For example, you may say: "It's no use arguing about this anymore. I'm not going to change my mind and I hope you can respect my decision by not contacting me in any way. I think we both need time apart to accept the break up." You may want to cut communication with him to give him time to accept your decision and to avoid being tempted to renew the relationship. Avoid calling, texting, or emailing him, and do not answer any of his messages if he reaches out to you. Doing this will show him you are serious about your decision to end the relationship and will also help you to move on from the relationship.  

consider why you have decided to break up with him.  reach out to family and friends.  re focus on your needs and your priorities.  set up a time where you are both alone and can talk privately.  express yourself clearly and calmly.  use “i” statements.  be firm about your desire to end the relationship. 

 Residential traffic laws may have changed depending on how long ago or in which state or country you received your driver’s license.   Visit your state’s DMV website or your local Department of Transportation if you are uncertain about your state or country's residential traffic laws.; , Look for safety issues such as worn tires, leaking oil or faulty mirrors.   Wear your seatbelt and make sure any passengers are wearing their seat-belts as well. Buckle children into proper car seats and restraints., Again, which hand position states and countries deem safest vary from state to state and country to country. There are three hand positions that are commonly considered safe: 10 and 2, 9 and 3, and 8 and 4. Keeping your hands in the proper place on the wheel will help you have the safest and quickest response to obstructions should one arise., It is illegal in most states and countries to use a mobile phone while driving a vehicle. If you anticipate the need to make or receive a phone call while driving make sure you have a handsfree option to keep your full attention on the road.It is also generally illegal to wear earbuds in both ears while driving. If your hands free solution involves wearing earbuds, make sure you only have one earbud in at a time. Pull over if you have an emergency call you need to make or take. Even hands-free devices can sometimes be distracting while you are driving.  Speeding in residential areas, whether moderate or excessive, can be the difference between life and death. Check for signs posting the maximum speed limit in the residential area you are driving in. Paying attention to your speed and driving slowly will allow you enough time to respond to sudden obstructions in the road.Keep your speed between 20 and 25 mph (32 and 40 km/h) if you do not see any posted signs., Streets in residential neighborhoods are often narrower than major streets and highways. Make sure you are not taking up the whole road, especially when there is oncoming traffic.   If the road is too narrow to pass comfortably, pull over as far as you can onto the shoulder before continuing on.  Some people are tempted to roll through stop signs, especially on quiet residential streets where they think no one will notice. Check for people who might be crossing the street, and wait for them. Many residential streets do not have crosswalks, so you need to pay attention to anyone who needs to cross.   Look in all directions before you move again. Pedestrians always have the right of way.  Do not drive a vehicle if you have been consuming alcohol, illicit substances, or are taking medication that warns against driving. Avoid driving if your judgement and reactions are impaired and try to plan ahead if you anticipate drinking or taking necessary medication.Enlist the help of a friend to take you home or to your next destination. Call a taxi, Lyft, or Uber instead of driving yourself.  Make sure to frequently check your mirrors to see what might be beside or behind you. Be alert as your surroundings can change quickly in residential areas.   Use your horn if you think others nearby are dangerously unaware of you presence. Watch for children who might be playing in or around the streets. Look for pets that may be running near the streets and pedestrians who may be walking or running on sidewalks or in the road.  In addition to speed limits and stop signs, pay attention to other traffic rules and regulations.   Look for signs that prohibit U-turns, identify one way streets, and ask you to yield. Use turn signals when you need to turn, and make sure your lights are on in the evening or during rain, snow, or fog.  Go especially slow if there are potholes or weather conditions that might make the roads in a residential area slippery or difficult to see. Rain, fog, and snow all reduce the distance you can see and potentially contribute other hazardous conditions.Some residential areas have streets that are not paved and are instead made up of dirt or gravel. Dirt and gravel roads can be difficult to maneuver, so be sure to go slower than usual and take your time.Check the weather forecast if you plan on driving long distances.  Increased traffic through these streets contributes to a higher risk of injury and makes the neighborhood more dangerous.Try and make a policy of only driving through residential areas if you are stopping at a specific location within that area.  Yielding to police cars, fire trucks, snow plows, street sweepers and others that might be working to keep the neighborhood safe and clean will reduce the amount of traffic and keep the road as safe as possible.   Watch for bikes, motorcycles, scooters and other smaller vehicles that might be on the roads. They can be harder to spot, especially at night.  Passing laws are the same in residential and non-residential areas, but extra caution is urged as passing others in residential areas is less common and is not always necessary.Like in non-residential areas, passing stopped or slowed vehicles is allowed, and passing vehicles signaling to turn or driving the speed limit is prohibited. Be sure to check all traffic ahead, beside, and behind you when passing or being passed by others., Do not park on the side of the road, or in front of someone's house unless it is permitted.   Make sure there is enough room left on the road for motorists to safely pass your car if you do pull over to park. Watch for parked cars while you are driving. Look for people who might be opening doors to get out of those cars.  

familiarize yourself with residential traffic laws.  inspect your car before you drive it.  safely position your hands on the wheel.  connect a bluetooth headset or hands free mobile phone device.  pay close attention to your speed.  stay on your side of the road.  come to a complete stop at all stop signs.  avoid driving while intoxicated or under the influence.  be aware of your surroundings.  observe all rules of the road.  notice road conditions.  try not to use residential streets as shortcuts.  yield to other vehicles.  use caution when passing.  look for parking prohibitions and regulations. 

 Don't be confused if the results vary each time you perform the test. It is normal for the results to deviate due to the following reasons:   You might get a low result because your connection is being used by other programs. This does not mean that your connection speed is slower, just that the speed test is not able to connect to your computer with a strong connection. You may want to consider closing other programs that are using the Internet. You may experience a slower connection speed temporarily if your Internet service provider is performing scheduled maintenance work. The servers might be busy for the website that you are trying to perform the speed test through. This does not mean that you have a slower connection; it means that the website was not able to perform the test as quickly as it should have.  

measure your download speed a few times to get an average reading. 

 It's OK if they're minimized.; , The Start menu should come up.  "Turn off computer" should be highlighted.  This should select the "Logout" button.  The first time should pull up a dialog box asking you if you really want to log off, and the second time will automatically choose "OK".  Go outside and get some exercise or something. 

first, make sure there are no windows open.  press the "windows" key.  press the up arrow key.  press the left arrow key.  press enter twice.  walk away from the computer. 

 Hold her hand, play with her hair, and kiss her spontaneously. You want to keep physical contact between you throughout your relationship. It’s easy to take a partner for granted, especially when you’ve been together for a long time, but maintaining physical contact is very important for helping you create and keep a strong bond., It can feel kind of awkward, especially if you aren’t used to doing it, but talking about your relationship is healthy and important. It's generally a great bonding activity to make plans for the future and discuss what you really love about each other. Talking about your relationship will give her a sense of stability that she might not be able to find with anyone else.   Create a safe, nonjudgmental space where you both know that you can be honest with each other without being laughed or yelled at. Discuss and fix problems in your relationship before they become too big to solve. You can say something like, “You know how to make me laugh, even when I’m in a bad mood. I really love that quality about you, Ashley.” Alternatively, if you have an issue, say something such as, “Jacqueline, I feel upset when you ignore my text messages. It makes me wonder if I’ve done something wrong. Have I?”  , She’s going to have her own challenges to deal with, such as fights with friends, problems with her boss at work, and stress when she’s got a ton of things to juggle. Never let her doubt that you know she can handle it like a boss. You know that she’s strong and smart enough to conquer all of her problems, so tell her that.   Say something like, “I’m sorry that you’re dealing with Becca’s drama. It sounds like you’re in a tough spot. But that’s one of the really great things about you: you are such a loyal friend and will stick by her no matter what.”  , When you talk to each other, don’t just skim the surface and keep your conversations to things like what you did that day. It’s not enough to know her favorite color and her middle name. You need to talk about things that really delve into who you are as people. Doing so creates a deep and lasting bond.Ask questions like:   “What do you want your future to be like?” “Why do you avoid your sister’s calls?” “How does it feel to be the soccer captain?”  , Setting aside time to be a couple is crucial for your relationship, no matter how long you’ve been together. She needs to feel like you’re really there for her and that means being present as much as you can.For instance, plan a date for just the two of you, rather than your usual group of friends. If you’re living together, you can go to bed half an hour early so that you two have time to talk and be intimate.  Don’t tell her your life story on your first date. Instead, slowly reveal details about yourself and your past experiences to her. For instance, wait until she asks about your education to reveal that you graduated at the top of your class from MIT. She’ll be impressed by the accomplishment as well as your modesty.Don’t tell your girl you’re an amazing cook. Instead, surprise her with a home-cooked meal that will have her praising your skills in the kitchen. You can even bring the meal to her for lunch if you aren’t able to have the house to yourself.  If you are a genuinely interesting person, it’ll be easier for her to stay interested in you. Work on becoming more mature and pursuing new goals, and let your interests change naturally.]  For example, try taking one of your interests and making it into a serious hobby. If you love comic books, try creating your own.  Respecting her is crucial to keeping her interest. Show her that you value her opinion and make sure that she puts in her two cents when it comes to decisions that you make together. Let her talk without interrupting her, listen to her, and never insult her or belittle her. Basically, follow the golden rule: treat her how you would want to be treated., Being kind is an underrated value, and your girl will appreciate that quality in you. It’s not enough to just be nice to her, though, you need to show that you are truly a kind-hearted person. When you're mean to other people, and especially to people that are "weaker" than you, you send the message that she might someday expect the same.For example, if you talk behind your best friend's back, she may assume you’ll do the same to her when she’s not around. Be polite to strangers. Hold the door open for the people behind you, for instance.  When you're in a relationship together, focus on meeting her needs in balanced proportion. She has physical and emotional needs, and meeting just one of them isn’t going to cut it. If you don’t know what her needs are, then ask her. She will appreciate you taking the time to find out how to make her happy.Fill her physical needs by showing affection and ensuring she receives pleasure when you are intimate. Fill her emotional needs by listening to her, being supportive, and talking to her about stimulating and interesting things.  It can be easy to stop putting in effort after you’ve been together for a while. Yet, when you stop making the effort, she'll start to feel taken for granted, and you don't want that. Be sure to keep up with your appearance, make efforts to surprise and woo her, and keep trying to impress her.For example, come up with a really special way to ask her to prom. Consider her likes and interests and incorporate them into your plan. If she loves jelly beans, spell out “Prom?” in jelly beans in her room (after getting her parent's permission).  While spending time with each other is essential, you also need time apart. Couples that spend too much time together can get bored of each other’s company. It’s important to make sure you each have your own interests and friends. So, set up a Tuesday poker night with the boys or join a sports league that gets you out of the house on Saturday mornings.You could decide that you’ll hang out four nights a week and spend the other three with your own friends or family.  While she might not be outright looking for an adventurous guy, she certainly won’t say no to someone who’s willing to try new things and keep her life exciting. When all you do is sit on the couch, it can be hard to maintain interest. Solve this issue by getting out and enjoying your life together.   Take her to an amusement park and ride all the roller coasters together, for instance. For example, traveling and outdoor activities are always an easy way to experiment with being more adventurous. Try going for a hike in the mountains in the next state over. Road trip!  , When you show her that you care about things she finds important and that you’re willing to work to help her pursue that part of her life, she’ll be really impressed. She wants to stay with someone who can understand her in that way and that she knows she can count on for support. Find ways to help her pursue what she loves and you’ll go far toward keeping her interest.For example, if she really loves fashion, help her start a blog or vlog where she can give advice to others. You can take pictures of her and help her figure out how to start and design a website.  Taking on challenges together will certainly make your lives more interesting, but it will also help you feel closer together and increase your confidence in each other. Taking on challenges together is actually one of the most effective ways of building strong feelings between two people. You can consider things like:   Getting in shape or trying a new sport Improving your grades and raising your GPA  , Learning together can be a great way to keep things interesting. This will not only engage your brains (together!) but it will also give you more things to talk about and chances to bond. There are lots of different ways that you can learn together and many are free. By choosing a subject that you’re both interested in, you also ensure that it’s fun.Watch online educational videos, like TEDTalks or Crash Course on Youtube Take free online courses with sites like Coursera, or sign up for a class at your local community college.  One of the worst things you can do for a relationship is to let things become routine. Eating at the same restaurant and going to the same stores in the mall every weekend gets boring, and she may lose interest. Instead, be spontaneous to show that you’re always thinking about ways to make her happy, not just following a set pattern of behavior.Take her on imaginative dates. Try something unusual every now and again, like geocaching or volunteering in your community. Get her a simple gift (flowers, a teddy bear, etc.) and surprise her with it at work or school.  

maintain physical contact.  talk about your relationship.  show her how much you believe in her.  ask the right questions.  make sure there's time for just the two of you.  be mysterious.  develop yourself as a person.  respect her.  be kind to everyone, not just her.  fulfill her needs.  put in effort.  spend time apart.  be adventurous.  pursue what she enjoys.  take on challenges together.  learn together.  be spontaneous. 

 Physical affection can help build empathy in your relationship. Give your partner a hug, a kiss, hold their hand, or put an arm around them. These simple gestures are good ways to focus your attention on your partner and form a physical connection between the two of you.Touching releases oxytocin, a chemical which helps increase feelings of happiness.  To help gain empathy for the other person in the relationship, watch them. When you have down time while you are spending time together, look at the other person. Think about what is going on inside their head and what they are thinking about. Look at their body language and pay attention to it.Try to figure out how they are feeling. Are they upset? Are they content? As you watch your partner, really absorb what you are learning and then care that they are feeling this way or doing this activity.  One way empathy can help with conflict resolution is to help you gain insight into what the other person is thinking. Instead of reacting emotionally, take a moment. Close your eyes and put yourself in your partner’s place. Think about how the situation looks for them, or how your actions may have been construed.Consider what you know about your partner's history, such as interactions with parents, other family members, their worldview, etc. This information should be available to you through the relationship, and it can add another layer of understanding of your partner's decisions, actions and how things may have affected them. Refrain from thinking about what you would have done in your partner's position when being empathetic — that is not the point of empathy. Instead, take all that you know about your partner and their background, and try to see how that might make them react how they did. For instance, you may not have yelled at someone whistling at you on the street, but you may know that your partner deals with catcalling and street harassment on a daily basis, and so they may be more likely to react. It may seem like an overreaction from your perspective, but from your partner's perspective and experience, it might seem like a pretty mild reaction. Looking at the situation this way can give you empathy for the other person. If both of you do this, instead of fighting, you will be able to talk about the problem and see the issue from the other point of view.  If you are trying to build empathy in your relationship, you may consider using activities to build more empathy between the two of you. These exercises aim at putting yourself in someone else’s shoes so you can learn empathy. You will try to connect to your partner by looking at things from their point of view.Good exercises to foster empathy include dramatization, role-playing, and imitating. You may also want to try dance therapy where you try to mirror your partner’s actions to increase awareness of the other person.  

touch your partner.  watch the other person.  imagine things from your partner’s point of view.  try empathy building exercises. 

 You might not spend the time checking yourself out each month because cancer doesn't run in your family, you are young, you feel healthy, or maybe you tend to put things off. However, you may want to familiarize yourself with how healthy breasts normally feel.Do this right after a period because this is when natural breast lumps will be at their smallest.   The upper breast tissue either feels long and thick or uneven and rounded. The lower breast feels smoother. Some random spots feel slightly bumpy normally; just be aware of changes each month.; , Different symptoms will alert you to a possible problem. Being familiar with each of them is something that you should add to your to-do-list! Educating ourselves is the best defense when it comes our health.Be aware that some tenderness or lumpiness can occur around the time of your period. If it doesn't go away by your next cycle, be concerned.If your breasts get red, become irritated, or the skin is flaky, you might want to see a doctor.If your nipple looks like it is flipped inside out (unless it usually looks this way), make an appointment.If your nipples produce any red, brown, yellow, or clear fluids, it's time for a check-up., It is integral that you do not delay seeking a physician's advice if you notice a change in or around your breasts. It is always better to be informed. Avoid thinking about the worse case scenario at this point, though.Make your appointment as soon as possible. The longer that you wait, the worse off you will be if the tumor or other symptom is a sign of cancer. Talk to friends and co-workers. Ask other women if they've ever had a similar experience and ask about the outcome. Hearing some positive stories will stop you from completely losing it. Panicking just gets your cortisol levels going. An uptake in cortisol is going to make you crave sugary, fatty, no-good-for-you foods. Drink some chamomile tea and calm down, as you need to stay healthy.  It might be scary when you find a lump or other abnormality. Don't freak out, though! It is more than likely that your lump is not cancerous, but you must receive confirmation of that from a doctor.Some lumps are just cysts. Cysts, which are filled with fluid, occur due to hormonal changes and it is common for women to experience them at some point in their lives.Other lumps might just be benign tumors. These are the result of tissue that has simply formed too quickly and is a bit abnormal as a result.You might be experiencing mastitis. This is an infection and the primary cause is breastfeeding. It can easily be treated with antibiotics. 

become familiar with how your breasts feel.  know the warning signs.  set an appointment and keep calm.  learn about the different types of breast lumps. 

 Do not seek out the other person for conversations or discussions. If you work with the other person, keep interaction limited and to a public area. Remain friendly and civil at all times, assuming behavior you’d exhibit with your child’s school principal or another professional.  If you have to correspond with the other person, keep it professional and concise. Don’t add jokes or personal information during your interaction. If you're not required to email or call the flirtatious person, avoid contact.  Never encourage the behavior after you’ve had a discussion or stopped interacting with the flirtatious person; this will send a mixed message and could rekindle the behavior. Keep any meeting limited to group situations and maintain limited to no contact with the specific person.  

remain friendly, but distant.  keep email or phone correspondence short and to the point.  don’t seek out the flirtatious person’s attention. 

 He may not be talking to you or hanging out because he’s either angry about something you did or he’s made new friends and is busy with other things.   If he’s changed how he acts around you because he’s no longer interested in being friends (or partners or whatever), there’s not much you can do to change that. In those situations, it has to do with him, not with you. If you think he may be angry, think about why. People get angry when they feel like you did something that had a negative impact on them. So the first step on the road to reconciliation is figuring out what you did to trigger him. Remember that sometimes what seem like minor actions or decisions to us can have big impacts on others, so think not only about what you’ve done recently but about which of your actions might have had negative effects on him. Once you have an idea of what you did that upset him, you can start working on de-escalating the situation.; , Key to getting someone past their anger or upset is showing them you understand their perspective and recognize how what you did affected them.   Put yourself in his position and imagine how whatever you suspect upset him must have made him feel. Empathize with those emotions and approach him with that empathy in mind. For example, to you, you were just late picking him up because traffic was crazy and you realized you forgot your phone halfway there. It wasn’t a big deal, it just happened that way. But to him, he had to stand out on the curb for 45 minutes when it was dark and cold, even though he told you what time to be there three times, and you promised you would be.  Once you have a sense of what may have upset him, make a genuine effort to empathize with how he may be feeling.   If you were late picking him up, in addition to thinking about how it might have appeared from his perspective, imagine what it may have felt like. For example, to him, it may feel like you didn’t make him a priority, you didn’t care about his discomfort or whether he had other things to do, and you broke a promise. Think about how you would feel about those things and empathize with him.  Apologize early and often; admit that you were wrong (if you were) and take responsibility.Tell him that you were wrong and that you won’t do it (whatever it was) again. And then don’t do that thing again. Don’t use the sorry-not-really-sorry line of “I’m sorry you got so upset.” It shifts the responsibility onto him and makes it sound as if you’re not sorry for your actions, you just wish he wouldn’t get mad about it. If he responds with a--potentially justified--angry text, apologize again. Continue apologizing if he comes at you with more angry responses. Simply say something like, “I’m sorry--I was wrong.”, Just apologizing or trying to explain that your intentions were good won’t work.   Saying you’re sorry isn’t enough--you need to show you recognize the negative consequences your actions had on him and that you sincerely regret it.If he feels like you genuinely understand why your actions made him mad, he’s more likely to feel validated and begin forgiving you. Even if you don’t necessarily think his feelings or reaction is justified, apologize anyway. If you want him to like you again, you want him to see you understand how he’s feeling., Even if you say you’re sorry, it won’t be enough to make him like you again if you then start saying things that will escalate the situation.Don’t, for example, say anything about thinking his reactions were irrational or unjustified. It will make him feel like you aren’t really sorry and don’t really understand the situation--and he’ll go back to being mad.Don’t bring up things he’s done to upset you in the past. Turning the conversation into a tit-for-tat about who did what to who isn’t going to diffuse the situation. It will only make it drag on longer and make him less likely to forgive you., Asking for his input on what you can do shows that you’re listening to him and genuinely want to know what would make things better from his perspective.For example, you might say something like, “I know you had to wait 45 minutes for me and that it probably felt like I wasn’t making you a priority. How can I make it up to you in the future?”  , Humor is disarming. If you can make him laugh, or even smile a bit, you can get your foot in the metaphorical door.   Try being humorously self-deprecating. If humor is disarming, affable self-deprecation is doubly so. So try poking a little fun at yourself or acknowledging one of your endearing flaws. You might text him something purposefully ridiculous, like, “I’m really sorry I was late picking you up--we both know I’m a klutz, and I must have walked into at least five walls trying to get here.” Or you could text something more honest but still gently self-deprecating, like, “You know how I look at the time on the clock as a challenge instead of a warning? Well...the clock won.”  , Particularly if the guy’s mad because he feels like you ignored him or his needs in some way, remind him that you do think about him--often.   For example, you might text him with an affectionate reference to something you saw that reminded you of him (bonus if it relates to a private joke between you), like, “I just saw a car with a Florida license plate and it reminded me of all the stories you tell about growing up there. It made me smile.”  , Don’t text him excessively. Apologize, and if he doesn’t immediately respond or forgive you, back off.   If you keep texting him, you’re going to undo any potential good you’ve done by irritating him rather than charming him. If he needs time to get over it, give him that time. Let him come to you when he’s ready.  If he won’t tell you what’s upsetting him, it’s either because he’s so mad he can’t talk about it or it’s a ploy for attention. In either case, you need to let the issue rest and let him come to you.   If he seems truly angry but can’t or won’t tell you why, he probably needs time to process and let the worst of the anger pass. Even if you don’t know what you did and it’s driving you crazy not to know, let it be. Don’t insist that he tell you; let him take the time he needs. When he’s ready, he’ll come to you and you can work things out from there. If his anger doesn’t seem entirely genuine, he’s probably acting angry to get attention, and the more you ask what’s wrong and what happened, the more he’ll prolong the situation to get as much out of it as he can. Just tell him you don’t know what’s angering him and that you’re sorry if it’s something you’ve done. Then leave it at that and let him come to you when he’s done trying to manipulate your attention.  If he’s so mad about something that none of your attempts to empathize or apologize are working, step out of the situation.   There’s nothing else you can do or say at this point to make him like you again, so it’s best just to back off. After some time has passed, he may be feeling less upset and may come to you when he’s ready to talk. You can’t force him to talk to you before he’s ready, so your best option is to wait.  If he’s constantly getting angry with you over things you either don’t understand or feel are unreasonable, consider whether the relationship is really worth it.   If being around him causes you more grief than pleasure, maybe it’s time to just let the relationship go. If he verbally, emotionally, or physically abuses you when he’s mad, get out of the relationship immediately.  If all else fails and the guy probably isn’t going to give in no matter what you do, you might as well have a little fun.“Makeup apps” allow you to choose the gender of the person you’re trying to make up with and which excuse you want to use to win them back.Obviously, if your sincere efforts were unsuccessful, an app probably isn’t going to do any better, but if you’ve got nothing left to lose, you might as well. Worst case scenario, you’ll be entertained by the messages the app sends on your behalf saying you were kidnapped by Russians.Try coming up with clever responses to his non-responses. If he won’t text you back and you know he’s probably never going to, you might as well go out on a high note. Be hyperbolic (“I spent so long waiting for you to text back that feral cats ate my face and hands and now I’m texting you with my toes and will soon be dead.”) or incorporate some spot-on memes or gifs into your final sign-off., Don’t dwell on the situation or stay up nights thinking about what you should have said or what a jerk he is.   Accept that he’s upset and that the relationship might have to end. Start to go on with your life.  

think about what may have happened.  step into his perspective.  empathize.  apologize.  show that you understand the impact your actions had on him.  avoid escalating the situation.  ask what you can do to make it up to him.  make him smile.  let him know you’re thinking about him.  know when to back off.  don’t press him if he won’t tell you why he’s mad.  know when to give up.  know when it’s not worth it.  get some satisfaction.  move on. 

 Hostas aren't overly sensitive to cold, so you can plant them as soon as the ground is warm enough to work in the spring. Spring and late summer are the ideal times to plant hostas, because they are in active growth phases and will take root easily.   If you're going to plant hostas in late summer, do it at least six weeks before the first frost.; , Hostas are shade-tolerant plants that require minimal amounts of sun – though they also won’t thrive in deep shade. The ideal location is somewhere protected from strong winds and hail, that’s shaded between the hours of noon and 4 p.m., and that receives some filtered sunlight.You can protect hostas from sun, wind, and hail by planting them under established trees. Make sure you don’t plant them too close to the roots, however, or the hostas will have to compete for nutrients. Hosta’s shade tolerance depends on the type. As a rule, those with yellow leaves can survive more sunlight than hostas with green, blue, or white leaves. Blue hostas need the most protection from the sun.Hostas will also thrive near outer building corners that still get some mild sun exposure.  In the area where you want to plant the hostas, till the ground to a depth of 8 inches (20 cm) using a manual tiller, rototiller, or hoe.Amend the soil with organic matter that will loosen the soil, discourage rodents, and acidify the soil slightly.   Good organic matter for hostas includes aged manure or compost, peat moss, and leaf mulch. The ideal pH for hostas is between 6 and 6.5. Hostas don’t need a large space for planting. If you're planting individual hostas, the hole only needs to be as wide as the root system.  Sometimes hostas come from nurseries in bags with bare roots. It’s especially important to soak the roots if that’s the case with your hostas, because it will help prepare the plants for transplanting.Choose a bucket or bowl that’s slightly smaller than the crown of the hosta. Fill the bucket with cold water. Rest one hosta crown on the rim of the bucket so the roots are soaking in the water below. Repeat for each hosta. Soak the plants for at least an hour before transplanting. If you're not transplanting the hostas immediately, leave them soaking to keep the roots moist.  Right before planting, remove the hostas from the buckets and use your hands to gently untangle the roots. Use your fingers to carefully comb the roots so there aren't any tangles, and ensure all the roots are facing the direction they're growing in.Hostas, especially potted ones, are susceptible to tangled roots. The plants can strangle themselves if you try to plant them in the ground with their roots tangled.  For each hosta, dig a hole in your prepared garden bed that’s about 2.5 feet (76 cm) wide and 1 foot (30 cm) deep. Place one hosta in each hole, making sure the roots don’t become bent or tangled. Fill the hole loosely with soil, but do not pack the soil around the roots. Make sure only the roots of the plant are buried, and that the entire crown is above the ground.Water each plant thoroughly immediately after planting. Leave enough space between the hostas to accommodate for their mature width. This will depend on the variety of hosta you have. If you're not sure, leave about 3 feet (76 cm) of space between the hostas.  The mulch will help keep the soil moist, prevent weeds from growing, and protect the plants from rodents. After planting, add a 3-inch (7.6-cm) layer of mulch to the top of the garden bed around the hostas.   Ideal mulch for hostas includes shredded bark, pine needles, or mulched leaves., Soak the soil after you plant the hostas. Keep the soil evenly and consistently moist throughout the life of the plants. Hostas that are exposed to lots of sun need even more water to prevent burning.   Give the hostas about an inch (2.5 cm) of water per week during active growing phases in spring and summer., Hostas will enter a dormant state in fall and winter, meaning they won’t grow and won’t require as many nutrients. When fall arrives, prune the hostas by trimming off dead or yellow leaves.Dying leaves can still suck nutrients from a plant, so you can help the hostas conserve energy for winter by removing these leaves in fall.  Hostas are hardy plants and will survive the winter, but they’ll have a better chance of thriving if you prepare them for the colder months. After the ground freezes, cover the ground around the hostas with fallen leaves, and pack more leaves around the crowns of the plants.Leave the hostas packed and covered with leaves until after the last frost in spring. Covering the plants with organic matter will also help maintain the soil temperature and moisture level.  

wait for the right time to plant hostas.  choose a location with the right amount of shade.  amend and till the soil.  soak the plants.  untangle the roots.  dig holes and plant the hostas.  add a top layer of mulch.  provide the plants with consistent moisture.  prune dead leaves in fall.  prepare the hostas for winter. 

 Put loads of plants and trees to make it look like the forest or the wilderness. Add trees, clover patches, bushes and caves. Maybe add a few animals you'd find in the wilderness or the forest as plushies.  Unlock your den and say, "Deer herd my den!" when you have enough people, say "Last calling!" then go to your den and buddy every one there. Ask them for their deer name and rank, but if you want to, you could use the first part of their animal name; for example, if someone's name was 'Infinity Arctic moon', you'd call them Infinity., You could graze or run around., Wolves may hunt deer, so be scared! You could fight them though, but that'd be risky., It's your responsibility to take care of your herd, so do! And also, always have fun and warn bad deer. 

make your den appropriate.  invite people.  go to sarepia forest or zios every now and then, and just do stuff.  run away if a wolf is near.  have fun and take care of your herd. 

 This will give your rocket more stability in flight. It is also an important decorative element in making your water rocket look recognizably like a rocket, so be sure to pick out a color paper you like.   Draw a circle about 1’ in diameter. The measurement doesn’t need to be precise, as you can make adjustments later. The simplest way to do this is to find a bowl of about the right size, place it upside down on the piece of paper, and trace it.Cut out the circle, and cut a straight line from the outside to the approximate center of the circle. Again, precision isn’t particularly important, just estimate where you think the center is.Slide the cut edges over each other to create a cone shape. Hold it over the cone to figure out the right size, and then tape or glue the paper together so it holds that cone shape.; , Like the nose cone, these will aid in stability, and make your rocket look more rocket-like. There is no one right way for the fins to look, but they will likely be right angled scalene triangles (i.e. the sides will all be different lengths) with the second-longest sides of the triangles attached to the sides of the rocket. It’s up to you to decide the exact dimensions of your fins. Start by cutting a triangle out of cardboard, and holding it up to the side of the rocket to see how it looks. Adjust the shape until you’re satisfied, then trace it onto the cardboard twice and cut two more identical triangles.  The nose cone goes on the bottom of the bottle. The fins go midway up the body, spaced equally apart from each other around the circumference. Use a low-heat hot glue gun to avoid melting the plastic. 

make a nose cone out of paper.  cut three fins out of cardboard.  attach the nose and fins to the bottle. 

, You will need to raise it high enough to access the brackets or straps that secure the tank, and if the tank it to be completely removed from underneath the vehicle, you will want to be sure it is high enough the tank will clear the frame members. Once the car is lifted off the ground, support it with jack stands. 

chock the front wheels of the car, making sure it can't roll while you are raising it or working underneath it.  lift your vehicle with a hoist or a jack. 

 Turmeric is a root that looks similar to ginger root, often carried in grocery stores and health food stores. You can buy whole yellow turmeric root in bulk and store them in the refrigerator for use within a month.Store whole turmeric root in an air-tight container, layering the roots between clean dry paper towels. Change the paper towels once they become damp so the roots do not mold.  You can also find turmeric in powder form in the spice aisle of your local grocery store. It should appear bright yellow and often comes in a clear, glass bottle. You can store ground turmeric in a cool, dark space or on your spice rack, away from direct light., Peel the skin off the root with a peeler and finely mince the root as you would a ginger root or garlic. You can then saute turmeric root with onions, carrots, and celery. Add in a healthy fat source, like coconut milk, as well as other vegetables, to make stews and curries.You can also add turmeric root, in fresh root or ground form, to soups to act as a spice base. Add a dash of turmeric to chicken noodle soups or coconut milk based soups.  Turmeric’s peppery flavor works well with roasted vegetables and adds depth to vegetable dishes.

The recipe for chicken stir fry with turmeric can be found here: http://www.seniorlifestyle.com/5-turmeric-recipes-combat-alzheimers/.  If you tend to jump start your mornings with a smoothie, you may want to consider adding turmeric to your next morning smoothie. Pair ⅛ ground turmeric to a smoothie with carrots, raspberries, goji berries, and coconut milk or almond milk. You can also use fresh turmeric in place of ground turmeric. The taste of turmeric is often masked by the other flavors in smoothies., Turmeric tea is a great way to consume turmeric, especially if you are fighting off an illness or a cold.   You can make turmeric-ginger tea by boiling ¼ teaspoon ground turmeric and ¼ teaspoon ground ginger in 1 cup water. Let the tea simmer on the stove for 10 minutes. Then, add a splash of milk or soy milk and strain the tea into a tea cup. Add honey or sugar to taste., You can also add turmeric to hot chocolate to create a warm, peppery drink.Combine 1 cup milk, coconut milk, or almond milk with 1 tablespoon unsweetened cacao powder, 2 teaspoons honey, ¼ teaspoon ground turmeric (or ½ teaspoon grated fresh turmeric root), and ¼ teaspoon cinnamon in a small saucepan. Bring the mixture to a simmer, whisking the mixture until the spices and the cocoa are well combined.  Turmeric cake is popular in middle eastern baking, as it is simple to make, savory, and vegan. It has a bright yellow color, reminiscent of turmeric, and is often served with one pistachio in the middle of each slice of cake.To make turmeric cake you will need 3 cups self-rising flour, ⅔ cups sugar, 1 tablespoon ground turmeric, 1 ½ cup unsweetened shredded coconut, ¾ cup vegetable oil, 1 ¾ cup sweetened almond, coconut, or soy milk, 1 tablespoon tahini, and shelled pistachios as a garnish. Start by preheating your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Then, coat the bottom and sides of an 11 x 7 baking dish with the tahini.

 Simply stop adding the chlorine tablets that you regularly put in your outdoor swimming pool. Exposure to sunlight will gradually dechlorinate the water. You’ll need to leave the pool uncovered for two weeks., If you only need to dechlorinate a bit of pool water to irrigate a tree or a shrub, you can use a bucket. Scoop out a bucket of water and place it in a sunny spot. Leave it in the sun for a week, and the chlorine should be evaporated., Although you have stopped adding chlorine, you should continue to run the pump. By circulating the water in your pool, the pump will help ensure thorough dechlorination. 

stop adding chlorine to your pool.  use a bucket to dechlorinate a small amount of water.  run the pool pump. 

 Wooden and rubber stamps are best cleaned using wipes, while acrylic, foam or plastic stamps can be cleaned with soapy water.; , Baby, travel or other wipes can be used to wipe a stamp off, either rubber or acrylic/foam stamps. Wipe until the ink comes off, then press onto a paper towel to dry.   Only use wipes free of alcohol or aloe vera.  This method is best for acrylic or plastic stamps that are formed from one material.   Fill a bowl with warm, soapy water. Dip the stamp in. Scrub the ink off with either an old toothbrush or a cleaning cloth. Dab on a paper towel to dry.

 Combining asanas that make up a well-balanced yoga practice, or sequencing, is a difficult aspect of practicing yoga. Set a different asana sequence for each session that targets your hips, thighs and lower back and is based on the four types of poses. This can challenge your muscles and help you reduce your hips.         You can begin your sequence with a short meditation or chanting to focus your thoughts.Your sequence should comprise the following pattern: warm up of sun salutations, standing poses, inversions, backbends, forward bends, and closing poses.; , You do not have to be able to do every yoga asana in existence to reduce your hips. Mixing up different poses that can target and open the hips can strengthen your muscles, help keep your body from adapting to a routine, and assist in weight loss and reducing your hips.         Practice easier asanas first and challenge yourself with more difficult poses after you master basic ones.Do asanas from each type of pose in the following order: standing poses, inversions, backbends, and forward bends.You can add a twisting asana to soothe your spine between backbends and forward bends if you like.Consider varying how long you stay in each asana. You could flow through poses one day while holding them for 8-10 breaths on other days. This can help challenge your muscles., It is important to warm up your body before you start doing yoga that is targeted towards your hips. Doing a few rounds of sun salutations, or Surya Namaskar, can lubricate your joints and begin engaging the muscles around your hips.         There are three different variations of sun salutations. Do 2-3 rounds of Surya Namaskar A, B, and C to warm up. These different sun salutations can engage and condition your muscles, may help ensure a safe and more pliable practice, and could minimize your overall body fat.Surya Namaskar B is a good choice for reducing hips because it incorporates chair pose (uttkatasana), which can really target the muscles around your hips. Try practicing a sun salutation between different asanas to challenge your muscles and build endurance., You do not have to be able to do every yoga asana in existence to have an effective daily practice or to build muscle and lose fat. Integrating and mastering asanas that strengthen and open your hip area can help you put together a practice that can challenge your muscles and may help you minimize your hips.         Make sure to start with easier asanas and move on to more difficult poses as you master basic ones., After you’ve warmed up with sun salutations, do one or two standing asanas, or postures, to start. From mountain pose to the warrior series, these asanas build strength, stamina and flexibility in your lower back, thigh, and hip area.         Always begin any yoga practice in tadasana, or mountain pose.Add other standing poses such as vrksasna (tree pose), uttkatasana (chair pose), and utthan pristhasana (lizard pose) to help open your hips from improved flexibility.The Warrior Series, which is known as Virabhadrasana I, II, and III, and anjaneyasana (low lunge) can help strengthen the muscles of your legs, butt, and hip area.As you progress, you can incorporate other standing poses such as Utthita Trikonasana (Extended Triangle Pose) can both strengthen and open your hips., Inversions are sometimes difficult, but they can help reduce your hips.From handstand to headstand, these asanas engage your lower back, butt, and leg muscles, and can also calm your circulation and stimulate your nervous system.         If you’re concerned about falling, ask for the help of a professional. This can help ensure that you enter the postures properly and don’t injure yourself.You can practice mukha vrksasana (handstand) on a wall until you have enough strength to hold yourself up.Gradually add forearm balance and salamba sirsasana (headstand) and pincha mayurasana (feathered peacock pose) as your practice improves.Never jump into any inversion. Too much momentum can lead to injury., Together with inversions, backbends comprise the most intense portion of any asana practice. From cobra pose to full wheel, backbends will strengthen and stretch the muscles surrounding the hips.         Try simple backbends such as aalabhasana (locust pose), bhujangasana (cobra pose), or setu bandha sarvangasana (bridge pose) before working up to dhanurasana (bow pose) and urdhva dhanurasana (full wheel or upward bow)., If your back needs soothing following backbends, neutralize your back with a twist. These asanas relieve tension and can aid flexibility in the hip area.         Ardha matsyendrasana (half lord of the fishes pose) or Parivrtta Trikonasana (Revolved Triangle Pose) are an excellent twisting asanas that open up your hips., You should always practice forward bends towards the end of a yoga session because they calm the mind and the nerves. From pigeon pose to star pose, forward bends will stretch and strengthen the muscles of the hips while and preparing you for closing postures and final relaxation.         Try paschimottanasana (seated forward bend), janu sirsasana (heat of the knee pose), gomukhasana (cow face pose), or tarasana (star pose). These asanas can stretch out the hips and help strengthen them. You may want to hold them each for 8-10 balanced breaths., Closing postures will end your active asana practice. From supported shoulder stand to corpse pose, these poses will quiet your mind and relax your body.         A good sequence to follow for closing postures is holding salamba sarvangasana (supported shoulderstand) and then immediately entering matsyasana (fish pose).These asanas will require you to engage your core and the muscles around your hips. If you cannot do salamba sarvangasana, try viparita karani (legs up the wall pose)., You’ve successfully finished your active asana practice and now it’s time to relax. End your practice in savasana (corpse pose) and enjoy the benefits of your yoga session., Cycle through vinyasas between poses for added hip reduction. This is more difficult than simply holding asanas, but has the benefit of more strength training and stretching.   Starting in whichever asana you choose, lower your body or thrust your legs until you land in a four point staff pose, which is called chatturanga dandasana in Sanskrit.Your elbows should be close to your body and bent at a 90 degree angle. Make sure to keep the abs and back side of the body engaged. This is a difficult position and keeping these muscles working will make it much easier.From chatturanga dandasana, roll over your toes to an upward facing dog position, or urdhva mukha savasana. This will make it easier to transition to the next and your final position, downward facing dog.Use your flexed toes to roll over on to the backs of your feet. Keep your thighs engaged and off of the floor as you push your chest through your arms. Gently arch your back and look up at the ceiling.End in downward facing dog. You’ve reached the final pose and a well-earned rest, so exhale and roll back over your toes so that your body ends up in an inverted “V” shape, which is downward facing dog or adho mukha savasana. This position should feel calming and allow you to rest as you get deeper into the asana, or pose.Keep your palms pressing flat against the floor, your sitting bones lifted towards the ceiling, and your abs engaged.Inhale and exhale steadily for as many breaths as you like., Try extending the duration of your practice by holding each pose a bit longer, adding additional asanas and flowing seamlessly between the poses. Add new and more challenging poses as you are able.Many yoga classes are between 60 and 90 minutes, so you could set your practice around that length or attend a class at a studio.  You may want to increase the intensity of your practice to help build strength and flexibility, burn calories and reduce fat around your hips. This can be done easily by holding each asana for varying times and by challenging yourself with more difficult asanas.          For example, poses that involve lunges or squats can be taken a bit lower. You can increase the speed of transitions between asanas to create more intensity. Adding a sun salutation or vinyasa between asanas can help torch calories and fat. You can also integrate more challenging poses. For example, you may want to try tripod headstand (sirsasana II) instead of regular headstand., One of the best ways to deepen your yoga practice and burn calories and fat is to increase the number of days you practice. You can safely build up to 5-7 days per week.Consider making yoga part of your daily routine or mix it up with other types of exercise for maximum benefit., Try combining different types of exercise with yoga. This may help you most effectively reduce your overall body fat.Cardiovascular exercise can help you lose fat when combined with yoga. Beyond walking, consider running, swimming, rowing, or biking.  In addition to cardiovascular exercise, strength training can help you reduce fat. It builds calorie-burning muscle while promoting your overall health and may also help improve you yoga practice.Before you begin any strength training program, consult with your doctor and maybe even with a certified trainer, who will create the best plan for your abilities and needs. Aim to do strength training moves such as leg presses that will help enhance the yoga moves you are doing to reduce your hips.  Eating healthy, balanced, and regular meals can help you lose any weight and burn fat. Foods that have moderate fat, complex carbohydrates, and are high in nutrients, for example, are best for your general health.   Stick to a diet of about 1,500-2,000 nutrient-rich calories a day, depending on how active you are.Eat lean proteins such as chicken, ground sirloin, or edamame with most meals, which will give your metabolism a slight boost and help you burn more calories.This will also help you burn any fat that may be contributing to excess weight. Eat whole grains such as whole wheat, oatmeal, and quinoa instead of starchy counterparts like bread., If you’re trying to reduce fat, it’s a good idea to avoid unhealthy or junk foods, many of which are loaded with fat and calories.Potato chips, nachos, pizza, burgers, cake, and ice cream will not help you lose weight, or excess water and sodium.   Stay away from starchy, refined carbs such as bread, crackers, pasta, rice, cereal, and baked goods. Eliminating these foods can also help you lose weight overall.

 Make some time at lunch or right after work to play with your cat. Throw a toy mouse for your cat or give your cat a ball of string to chase. Your cat will get tired out and will be more likely to sleep during the night., Cat towers with scratch surfaces and hanging balls to hit, mice and other toy animals for your cat to hunt and scratching pad toys are all good options. There are also circuit games where your cat gets to hunt a ball through a maze.Interactive cat toys range in price from $6 to $60. Consider finding a toy that requires minimum work on your part, so that your cat can play alone during the day.  If you live in the country and it is safe, you can let your cat outdoors during the day. Your cat will be able to climb trees, hunt and explore. After all of the daytime activity, your cat will be more likely to sleep at night.Allowing your cat outdoors always carries some risk. Other animals, parasites, and the elements all pose dangers to your cat. Consider this carefully before choosing to let your cat outdoors unsupervised.If you decide to let your cat outdoors, be sure your cat is spayed or neutered and up to date on vaccinations, flea and tick control, and heartworm prevention.  Watching birds is a fun routine for cats, especially if you need to keep them indoors. If you live in an area that accommodates a bird feeder, consider installing it in a location where your cat will be able to see it. Your cat will enjoy the activity and it will keep them occupied while you are busy with other things., Offer a high protein meal to your cat after your post-work playtime session. The combination of exercise and food will prepare your cat for nighttime rest.Look into high protein food. High protein diets are generally healthier for cats.Try searching for high-protein options at your local pet store.  It is important to set boundaries early in the life of your cat, so that they know not to disturb you during the night. If your cat is disturbing you at night, consider closing the door to prevent them from accessing your room and waking you., If your cat starts scratching at your bedroom door, try to ignore it. You should avoid giving in and playing with your cat, which will set up a positive feedback cycle, encouraging your cat to wake you up at night. Try to simply ignore your cat or put them in a different part of the house where they can’t disturb you as easily.You should also avoid negatively responding to your cat with anger or physical violence. In fact, any reaction to your cat may encourage them to continue the behavior. Simply ignore them when you can.  

schedule playtime during the day.  use interactive toys if you are away during the day.  let your cat outdoors during the day.  install a bird feeder.  feed your cat after playtime.  don’t let your cat sleep in your bedroom.  avoid responding to your cat during the night. 

 Not all debt is created equal. You might be able to negotiate a settlement with some creditors but not others. For example, the following are common debts people neglect to pay:    Unpaid child support or alimony. Your child support or alimony is set by a judge and can’t be lowered other than by court order. A judge won’t forgive you for failing to pay child support or alimony, so this debt can’t be negotiated down.  Back taxes. Typically, it is very difficult to lower the amount of taxes you owe. However, you might be able to get an installment agreement to pay back the amount of taxes over several years.Secured debt. A debt is secured when you pledged an asset as collateral. If you don’t pay, the creditor can seize the collateral. Secured creditors, such as your mortgage company, may be willing to suspend payments temporarily or change the terms of your loan. However, they are unlikely to lower the amount that you owe.Unsecured debt. Credit card debt, medical debt, and personal or payday loans are generally “unsecured” debts.This means there is no collateral securing the loan. You will probably be most successful settling these debts.; , Debt settlement typically involves offering a lump sum. In exchange, the creditor writes off the remaining unpaid debt. Many creditors are willing to accept a lump sum instead of setting up a repayment plan, since a lump sum is guaranteed money.Go through your savings accounts and other financial accounts. Check how much money you can pull together. If you need to, ask friends or family for an interest-free loan.  Everyone’s situation is different. For example, some debts are so old that the creditor or a debt collector can’t sue to collect them.You should know this before beginning to negotiation. Meet with an attorney to discuss your strategy for tackling your debts.   You can get a referral to an attorney by contacting your local or state bar association.Once you have a referral, call up the attorney and ask to schedule a consultation. Ask how much the consultation will cost. If you are low income, you might qualify for legal aid. You can find the nearest legal aid office by visiting the Legal Services Corporation’s website at http://www.lsc.gov.  Make an initial contact over the phone. You don’t know how the creditor will respond. They may be willing to help you. Find the phone number on the bills you receive and call.   The sooner you call the better. You want to negotiate directly with your creditor and not a debt collector, if possible.When you call, try to pin down how much you owe in total. This information might not be clear from your bills. For example, interest might accrue daily, and several days or weeks might have passed since you received your bill.  You should be able to explain in a few sentences why you can’t pay your bills. Remember to tell a consistent story each time.For this reason, it helps to be honest since you will not forget the truth.   You could say, “I was diagnosed with cancer two months ago and have had to pay for treatments. I haven’t been able to contribute a penny to anything else.” Or you could say, “I was laid off last month and am looking for work. I need some time to catch up on the bills.”  , You are probably feeling incredibly stressed. Nevertheless, you don’t benefit by getting angry. Always remain calm.You should be prepared to hear the person on the other end say, “No.”   You should expect threats of being sued or, if you have a secured loan, of losing your property. The more prepared you are mentally for these threats the easier you will be able to handle them.  You want to fully document the conversations you have with bill collectors. Always note who you are speaking to, as well as the day and time.Summarize what the person on the other end says. Also write down what you said in response. Sometimes, bill collectors make illegal threats. For example, a bill collector might threaten to put you in jail. It is illegal to make those kinds of threats, so you want to fully document them.  After you’ve figured out what you can afford, you should make a formal offer to settle the debt. You can draft a debt negotiation letter and mail it to the creditor. Send a letter even if the creditor sounded resistant to negotiating over the phone. Remember the following:Format the letter like a standard business letter. Include your essential details: your account name and number, as well as the amount you currently owe. Explain why you can’t make the monthly payment. Make an initial offer. Ideally, you want to repay 40-60% of the total debt, so make your initial offer on the low end. You can’t be more aggressive because you can’t threaten bankruptcy. Mail the letter certified mail, return receipt requested and keep a copy of the letter for your records.  The creditor might not agree to your initial offer. In this situation, you will need to continue to negotiate. If the creditor insists you pay 90% of the amount owed, you can increase the amount you are willing to pay—for example, from 40% to 45%.   Remember not to agree to amount you can’t afford.Go back to your proposed monthly budget to double check that you can make payments.  You want to harm your credit score as little as possible. Accordingly, you should try to negotiate how the creditor will report the debt to the three credit reporting agencies. For example, you want the creditor to agree to report the debt as “paid in full.”You should also try to get the creditor to remove negative information from your credit report.  Once you reach an agreement, be sure to get a settlement agreement or Letter of Agreement from the creditor.The agreement should state the amount you will pay. It should also outline the interest and penalties you agree to pay.   If you don’t get something in writing, then the creditor could claim that no agreement was reached.Remember not to make any payment until you have a signed agreement in place.  

identify your types of debts.  figure out the largest lump sum you can offer.  meet with an attorney to discuss your options.  call the creditor.  explain why you have fallen behind.  remain calm.  take detailed notes.  draft a debt negotiation letter.  continue to negotiate.  negotiate how the creditor will report the debt.  get your agreement in writing. 

 Any rechargeable battery has around 500 recharge cycles, after which, you'll need a new one. You probably already know this(reduce brightness, back lighting, fast-forwarding etc).; , Your iPod has a lithium ion battery, For best results, recharge it frequently. Once in a month, let it drain completely and then fully charge it again.  This is more important than you might be thinking.  Also avoid contact with water. If your iPod does get drenched, IMMEDIATELY turn it off. Dry it out gently using a soft towel, then leave it to dry completely(preferably under a fan).  A stitch in time saves nine.  

try to reduce battery consumption.  recharge the battery.  buy a good case for your ipod.  never expose your ipod to extreme temperatures.  if you have any problems with your ipod that leave you dumbstruck, immediately take it to an authorized apple center. 

 What about this girl attracts you? Why do you feel the way you do? What are your feelings for this girl -- romantic, friendly, confused? Take some time to think about what you want out of your relationship so you can have a clearer idea of what to so.   It can help to write down your feelings, potentially as a letter to her. You don't have to send it, but writing down your feelings can help you get a handle on them.; , Find out some things you have in common, and things you don't. Things you agree about, and things you don't. You and her could end up liking the same thing, and not even have had the slightest clue because she's been hiding it so well.   If you don't talk often, try and get her to initiate conversation. Hang out with her and her friends, sit next to her at class, and put yourself in a place to chat.  Think about your feelings and find a way to say them. You might write down a few lines, get together a quick "practice line," or rehearse the conversation in the mirror.   "I think you're great, and would love a chance to get to know you more." "I really enjoy our friendship, and I was hoping we could go on a date or two to see where things go." "Let's go out on a date sometime."  , Preparation aside, you have to be ready to improvise when the actual conversation starts. This can be difficult if you are naturally shy, so don't try and overdo it. Say what you want to say quickly, then let her talk from there. Your response doesn't have to be planned, and it will come off more naturally if it is not.  

spend time thinking about your own feelings.  take some time to get to know her.  prepare what you want to say.  don't rely too much on canned lines. 

 There are a variety of baskets available on the market. Consider what will fit with your decor and what theme works well with your garden and plant choices. Also select the size that best suits the type of plant that you will be planting, including consideration for its likely future growth. Hanging baskets are typically available in such materials as:   Stout galvanized wire       Solid plastic       Ceramic pot in a macrame or other knotted hanger       Ceramic pot attached with wire       Plastic mesh or basketry      ; , Lining a basket helps to keep the soil in place and reduces the need for watering; it also neatens the appearance of the basket. The best lining for a hanging basket is sphagnum moss. This works especially well with hanging baskets that are wire based. Another lining that can be substituted for sphagnum moss is polythene; be sure to punch some holes in the base of this lining to allow the water to seep through and ensure good drainage. For the most successful water retention and reduced need to water in large baskets, combine sphagnum moss and polythene linings (polythene over the sphagnum moss, with small holes poked in the polythene).  A good quality potting mix or compost should be used for hanging baskets. Add a slow-release fertilizer and mix well before filling the basket.  The best plants to use in a new hanging basket are well-established plants that are either flowering or are close to flowering. Arrange large plants first and tuck in smaller plants around these, including trailing plants at the edge. There is a huge variety of plants that work well in hanging baskets; some plants that are ideal for hanging baskets include:   Lobelia        Gypsophila (baby's breath)       Nasturtiums       Geraniums (long-flowering)       Hoya       Verbena       Fuschias       Begonias       Pansies       Polyanthus        , Once the basket is filled with soil and plants, it is heavy. Be sure to have a sturdy surface to stand on for hanging (such as a stepladder correctly placed so that it won't wobble). Make sure that the hooks used to hang the baskets are very strong; the basket will become even heavier after each watering.  Where you place your hanging baskets will depend in large part on the reasons behind why you want them. Perhaps you want to disguise something that isn't so pretty, perhaps you want to brighten up an area or perhaps you simply want a brilliant display of flowers that you love. Be guided by the reasons that drive you. Also be considerate of the plants' needs; few plants can withstand full sunshine or full shade when they are planted in a hanging basket.  Depending on the temperature and the plant type, hanging baskets may need to be watered daily. Get a good quality watering can or a plastic container with a nozzle that reaches high; you can squeeze the water up from the container through the nozzle and into the plant to save you having to reach to high places.  

select a basket.  line the basket.  choose good soil.  select strong plants that are appropriate for growing in a basket.  hang well.  place in good positions.  keep watered.

 Both your vet and your local animal poison helpline will likely direct you to administer activated charcoal to your poisoned cat. Activated charcoal is a substance made from some combination of coconut shells, wood, coal, or other natural substances. It is a common treatment in poisoning situations because it traps toxins and neutralizes poisonous substances.Activated charcoal is available in capsule form. Your vet will provide the correct dosage based on the weight and age of your cat.  Instead of activated charcoal, your vet might choose to induce vomiting – described clinically as emesis. Typically, this is done by feeding your cat a pill that triggers vomiting.Common emetics for cats include midazolam, xylazine, and dexmedetomidine.If your pet is already vomiting (or has vomited) in response to marijuana poisoning, there is no need to induce vomiting.  Your vet may administer specific treatments or medications to alleviate your cat’s symptoms. For instance, if your cat is experiencing seizures, your vet might administer anti-seizure medications. If your cat is having difficulty breathing, your vet might provide oxygen therapy.Cats who experienced unstable bowels as a result of marijuana poisoning will need to be rehydrated. This is best achieved by the administration of intravenous (IV) fluids. Your vet will insert a thin needle into your cat’s vein and pump hydrating solution into its veins. 

give your cat activated charcoal.  induce vomiting.  treat your cat’s symptoms. 

 Spring opening time is ideal for annual preventative maintenance steps such as cleaning, lubricating, inspecting and replacing components in all of your system equipment. Consult your owner's manual and give everything a good inspection. Look for and correct hazardous electrical conditions, such as broken conduit or connectors, lack of proper grounding or bonding, wires exposed to weather, etc. Inspect pool for tripping and slipping hazards. Check again for pressure leaks which may result in pipes or equipment blowing apart. Note water level and watch the pool for leakage during the following few days.  Skim pool, vacuum pool, brush pool. Leaf rake (bag) types skim nets are best, also useful for scooping large amounts of leaves/debris from pool floor. If pool is especially silty or has lots of algae, Vacuum Pool to Waste. This means to bypass the filter, and vacuum dirt from floors/walls out the backwash line. This prevents constant clogging/cleaning of filter. To do this, you may need to fill pool to the very top, so you can waste 1-3". Place the multiport filter valve on drain to waste position (usually 2pm, if viewed as a clock face) If you have a push-pull filter valve, or a cartridge type filter there is no easy way to vacuum to waste, except for cutting the pipe coming out of the pump and then reconnecting afterwards. Brush the pool thoroughly.  Use a good quality pool water test kit. Replace test kit reagents every spring (annually). Follow pool water test instructions carefully to obtain accurate results.   Alkalinity first. If below the range of 80 - 120 ppm, add Total Alkalinity Increaser (Sodium Bicarbonate or baking soda) at a rate of 1 lb per 10,000 gallons (37,854.1 L) to raise Alkalinity levels 10 ppm. Calcium level should be 180 - 220 ppm. Add Calcium Hardness Increaser (Calcium Chloride) at a rate of 1 lb per 10,000 gallons (37,854.1 L) to raise Calcium levels 5 ppm. Test pH level after water has circulated 8 hrs. pH level should be 7.4 - 7.6, add pH Increaser (soda ash or sodium carbonate) if the water is acidic/ corrosive (below 7.4). Add pH Decreaser (muriatic acid or sodium bisulfate) if water is basic/ scaling (above 7.6). A good test kit will allow you to perform an acid demand or base demand test to determine exact amounts of acid or base needed (demanded). A clarifier may be used to help filter efficiency. After balanced chemicals have been circulated for 8 hrs, shock or super-chlorinate the pool. Add granular Shock Treatment (Calcium Hypochlorite) to pool at a rate of 1 lb per 10,000 gallons (37,854.1 L), or use Clorox Bleach (Sodium Hypochlorite) at a rate of 5 gallons (18.9 L) per 10,000 gallons/pool water. Cyanuric Acid levels should be tested if chlorine is used (outdoor pools only). Add CYA (Conditioner or Stabilizer) to raise if Cyanuric Acid levels are below 30 - 50 ppm.  Distribute them broadly and never mix chemicals. Brushing pool after adding chemicals is helpful to distribution. Re-test water daily and readjust if needed. Backwash filter after 24 hrs. If algae is still present, re-shock pool, or add "kill" dosage of quality algaecide. Your pool is ready for use when chlorine level drops below 3.0 ppm, and water is clear. It may be a good move to have an annual check-up to your pool by a pool professional, which is why many people use pool companies to open the pool. If there is a pool store nearby, you should at least take a water sample in to be tested by another test kit.  

perform inspections.  clean pool.  check and balance chemistry.  always read instructions on packaging for proper handling, treatments and application of the pool chemicals. 

 At least 2 weeks before the pups are due, let the dog explore her whelping box. Make sure it’s placed somewhere quiet. She will want to nest in a quiet place in the time leading up to the birth.  To help your dog get used to the box, plant treats in it regularly. Then she will associate this box as a quiet place with good things., Don’t worry if the dog doesn’t choose to labor in the whelping box. She will choose a place where she feels safe. This might be behind a sofa or under a bed. As long as she is not in danger of hurting herself, leave her be.If you try to move her, she may become distressed. This can slow down or even stop labor.  If the dog chooses to labor under a bed or behind a sofa, it can be helpful to have a flashlight. This way, you can visually check on her.  Program your vet’s number into your phone or post it on your fridge. If an emergency arises, you want to have ready access to the number.   Consult with your vet about how to get a hold of them if your dog gives birth at night.  A trusted person should stay with the dog to make sure things go smoothly during the birth. This person should be very familiar to the dog. Limit people entering and leaving the space where the dog is giving birth. This can distress and distract the dog, potentially postponing her labor., Your dog needs to concentrate on giving birth. Do not invite the neighbors, children or other friends to watch the action. This will distract and distress the dog and could potentially postpone her labor. 

let your dog explore the whelping box.  put your dog’s favorite treats in the box.  let your pregnant dog choose the place to labor.  keep a flashlight handy.  keep your vet’s phone number handy.  have one adult monitor the birth.  do not bring visitors to watch the birth. 

 You should find it in your local nursery. They are psyllid resistant and have great cultivars such as ‘Hot Flush’, ‘Allyn Magic’, Hedgemaster’, ‘Minipilly’ and ‘Dusky’.; ,, Design your garden so you have plants that flower at different times of the year and not only during spring. There are now better ways to beat the winter doldrums than to see a patch of colour on a cold day – try Croweas or Correas.  They can be grown in harsh conditions such as on: rocks and logs, above ground, in dappled light to full sun and are tough near drought tolerant plants (water only every two to three weeks) and they flower great in spring., Two that have been found to flower for nearly a month are: P. ’Poorinda Ballerina’ and P. phylicifolia. The later also grows and flowers well in shade. Both recommended as they are hardy and only grow to a meter tall.  If yours are just sitting there looking unhappy and not flowering they need a lot of water in winter (especially the taller flowering forms that flower in spring only) as this is what they receive in their original habitat - the Southwest corner of Western Australia. For the smaller flowering Bush series that flower all year round, it is best to give them less winter watering than their taller cousins., Lillypillies are a name adopted for Acmena and Syzygium and a few other related plants. They are generally hardy and pest free. However when grown in dappled light or shady areas some of them are particularly prone to being attacked by Psyllids – a small insect that gets into the leaf and produces tiny “bubbles” on the surface and it can create quite bad distortion of new growth and looks unsightly. Acmenas and Syzygium luehmannii and most Syzygium australe cultivars are resistant to it.  There are far too many new and exciting plants to try, so dig out the under performers and consign them to the bin., A local to Sydney, it starts to flower in August then rests with the odd spot flowers and then starts flowering again more heavily in November/December. The showy 2.5 centimeter (1.0 in) five petal white flowers stand out well against the attractive green linear leaves. For me this plant is very hardy and is about 1.8 metres tall and is in a well drained position protected from the western sun.  

plant the acmena smithii variety minor if you feel that it's necessary to acquire a great screening plant that that is not too tall, (10 feet or 3 meters) not too wide, (about 3 feet or one meter) grows in sun, grows in shade, is drought hardy when established and has colored, new growth.choose syzygium luehmannii and its cultivars such as ‘royal flame’ and ‘little lucy’, and the hybrid syzygium ‘cascade’ because they are (almost) psyllid resistant and quite beautiful.  forget the spring flush.  try growing dendrobium kingianum and d. delicatum.  know that long flowering mint bushes prostanthera’s are not renowned for their long flowering time, unfortunately as they are very attractive in flower.  kangaroo paws anigozanthos species are promoted as drought hardy.  try some hardy, pest free plants.  be ruthless with plants that do not perform in your garden.  for a longer flowering season, try a long flowering plant look no further than ricinocarpos pinifolius or as it is more commonly known - the wedding bush. 

 The assignment could be from an instructor, your boss, your self, an organization etc.; , You can create a bubble map with the information, or take notes.  Good instructions will have clues as to what is expected.  Usually most important to least important. ,   What is the end purpose for this document? Is it for a grade, a raise, an operating procedure manual, etc. Who will the audience be? Are you trying to teach something to someone, explain your points, etc. What do I need to do or have to begin doing the work? Who can I talk to make this assignment be the best it can be?  

read the 'assignment' completely.  find a way to delineate the things that you must know or accomplish.  examine it closely.  present your ideas in a certain order.  ask questions about what is expected.  ,  ask yourself questions. 

 One piece will most likely be too weak to hold beads, using two or three strings will lengthen the lifetime of your beaded ankle bracelet. Cut your string at your ankle length.  Do this by taking all three pieces of your string and lining them up. Now fold them in half. Mark this spot with a pen.  Choose which bead you want in the center of your ankle bracelet and slide it onto the string. Move it down to the point that you just marked and tie knots on either side of it. This is now your center bead.   Beads can represent your outfit, mood, or personality. Choose beads that convey the message that you want.  In order to slide the rest of your beads onto your ankle bracelet, fold your string over a toothpick. This will be thin enough for your beads to fit over, but strong enough to keep your string from fraying at the ends.  Using your tape measure, mark ½” away from your center bead in both directions. Tie a knot at this spot and slide your next bead onto your ankle bracelet. Knot it again after the bead is in place.  Keep measuring ½” from each bead and fill your ankle bracelet with evenly spaced beads. Be sure to knot each one on both sides of the bead so that they stay where you want them.  Once you have beaded your ankle bracelet until there is approximately 2” of thread left on each side, test the length around your ankle. If you want to add one, or you need to take one off, now is the time for those adjustments.  For a beaded ankle bracelet, it is smart to use a clasp because the beads are heavier than just the string. A lobster clasp is the best for an ankle bracelet and is easily tied onto each side.You don’t necessarily have to use a clasp, but it extend the life of your beaded ankle bracelet if you do.  

measure your string.  find the center of your ankle bracelet.  thread your center bead.  use a toothpick.  measure ½” from your center bead.  continue beading.  test the length.  use a clasp. 

,,  Allow for the shaft tip to extend 1/4" inch or 5mm from the point. Round the tip with a file.  Here you will use to tie a loop with a string to another loop extending to the bottom tip and coil around the body.  Tightly wind up the 1 1/2 yard (1.25 meters) of a polyester thread coiling the string/rope up around to the top of the trompo.  Practice throwing and pulling to rapidly spin and release the spinner top. 

cast, carve or mold a funnel shaped spinner.use a lathe or bench-press drill to spin and cut out a well balanced mexican trompo spinning top.  drive a shaft, nail or pin through the middle to the bottom tip of the trompo.  leave a 5/16 " inch 7mm head top.  loop the end around your index finger. 

 Video de-noising is a process by which analog 'noise', such as lines, dots, color degradation and various other unwanted artifacts can be removed or diminished. The video denoising filter typically will be found in the effects and filters menu of the video editing application.  

use noise reduction, or video denoising, to improve video quality. 

 Clothing should always be alegre (happy) in Brazil. You may arrive and be surprised to see grandmothers dressing boldly. It is important for Brazilians to embrace a bold, personal style regardless of their shape or age.; , Brazilian are perfectionists: your clothes should always be cleaned and well ironed. Brazilians always dress up, even if they have to catch the plane. Even t-shirts should be clean and ironed in order to look new. Never dress down.  Bright colours and bold patterns are a good start towards building your brazilian wardrobe. Avoid dull and neutral colours as much as possible.  Unisex garments are not very popular in Brazil. In northern cities, it is rare to see women wearing trousers. Dresses or shorts paired with a stylish top are the usual attire.  Clothing should be well fitted, not baggy or loose. You should feel comfortable in your clothes, not as though you are being swallowed in fabric.  Wear ventilated clothing, and shower whenever possible. Brazilians take pride in smelling good.   Remember to clean your teeth (after each meal) and floss once a day. Spinach stucked in between your teeth will make you look silly.  You have to dress smart in Brazil. Check your destination’s weather prior to packing your luggage. Brazil has seasons: winters can be cold, while summers can be hot and very humid. Beware, some areas are dry and dusty.  Use a great bag, put on some bold jewellery, and have fun with your sunglasses! Accessories don’t need to be expensive, but they should make a statement about you. In some regions, wearing jewellery made from local natural materials such as seeds and wood, especially if well-made, will get you noticed and it will be taken as a sign of appreciation of the local culture.  Dressing down will not help you blend in. Looking sharp shows respect to your host in social occasions. All events are opportunities to dress up, have fun, and dress accordingly. Feel free to ask for advice in case of doubt: you are better off safe than sorry.  Your shoes should always be very clean. Flip-flops (chinelas) are appropriate in certain circumstances only. In Rio, they can be worn most of the time. In other cities, avoid flip flops unless you are heading to the beach. It will be obvious that you are a tourist.   Women should carry a pair of colorful sandals with fun details such as bows or flowers in their luggage, while men should invest in a good quality pair of leather sandals. Toenails and fingernails must be scrupulously clean. It is normal for women to paint their nails, and men often manicure too. ,, You’re in Brazil, you have to accept and love your body! Take a sarong or white shirt to cover up if you are shy.    Be aware that different religious festivals will require different colours, white being a common one.  Unless you are in the middle of the forest or bird-watching, don’t dress like you were going out on a safari tour.  They should not be baggy or made out of heavy material (you will get sweaty). Wearing heels with tight jeans is considered elegant in Brazil.  

be happy!,  have a polished wardrobe.  have fun with patterns and colors.  emphasize your natural features.  make it fit.  keep fresh.  layer.  accessorize.  dress up and don’t dress down.  value the importance of good shoes.  dress casual in rio, play eclectic and quirky in são paulo, and dress classy in the interior country.  ,  don’t go topless at the beach if you are a woman.  ,  prefer a bikini to a one-piece swimming.  dress up for any festivals in your area.  don’t wear outdoors gear in urban areas.  clean, well cut jeans are a good choice for casual wear. 

 The number one rule of free diving is to never dive alone. Make sure you are with someone who knows what you are doing and will be with you the entire time you are in the water. Many places have free diving clubs where you can meet others interested in training. Also check online forums if you don't have any friends who are interested in diving with you.  Learn and practice the "buddy system". When diving with a group, always pair up with a buddy. Your buddy is responsible only for you and you are responsible only for him. One is always on the surface while the other is under water.; , Make sure you have a mask and snorkel before you start practicing in the water. Select a mask that fits well and feels comfortable; you two will be spending lots of time together. When you move onto open water dives, you'll want a wetsuit to provide some protection from the cold; again make sure it fits well. Too tight and it will restrict movement and breathing and can be rather painful; too loose and it won't keep any cold out. A pair of fins will help you make the most of your time underwater, allowing you to swim further with less effort. European-made long fins are ideal for free diving.  Practice breathing through your mouth with the snorkel. Get used to the feeling of the mask, as it is a strange sensation to start off with.  Walk into the pool up to your middle and try using your snorkel whilst standing in the water. This can take a long while to get used to, since putting your head under water breathing in is not a natural thing to do. Just take it at your own pace and allow yourself to get comfortable with the whole, strange situation.  There are two positions free divers use: horizontal and inverted. The first one you'll need is the horizontal position. Hold onto the side of the pool and gently float yourself, face down, in the water. Keep breathing slowly and a little deeper to compensate for the snorkels dead air space.  As you dive down your snorkel will fill up with water. When you come up to breath the last thing you want after an epic long dive is to come up and empty your snorkel into your lungs! So, while floating in the horizontal position, dip your head under water and let a little bit of water into the snorkel. Use a short sharp breath to clear purge the water and leave you free to breath. Keep practicing this until you are comfortable clearing a full snorkel. You can also remove the snorkel from your mouth before the dive and you will breathe without the snorkel after the dive.  Now that you're comfortable with your snorkel and happily floating around, it's time to completely relax yourself in the water. While you float on the surface, simply curl up into the fetal position. Some divers will even come close to falling asleep in this position. This state of mind will be your mental base. Recall this feeling when you're diving to keep yourself calm and relaxed and help you dive longer and more comfortably.  The flutter kick will be your standard way of moving, just like when doing front crawl kick with alternating feet. The frog kick relieves tired muscles after all that fluttering. For short bursts of speed (and pretending to be a mermaid), use the dolphin kick. Use short kicks, make sure the blade doesn't bend more than 30 degrees to decrease energy wastage. Take a cue from the fish—to pick up speed, use rapid small fin beats.  This is one fluid movement where the diver takes a breath, bends at the waist, and dives vertically below the surface whilst clearing their ears. This technique is complex yet easy to master. Gain some momentum and take a deep breath out then inhale deeply, spreading you shoulders for maximum air intake. Bend at the waist and, keeping one arm at your side, seal the nose pocket of your mask with the other hand for ear clearing (see tips) and raise the opposite leg. Keep practicing until you can get a perfect, vertical descent.  The key to longer breath hold-times is practice. If you have been practicing so far in a pool (which you better had!) when you first step into the ocean you'll be comfortable and confident, able to calmly purge your snorkel when water gets in, and gently slip beneath the surface to enjoy the incredible world below the waves.  

get a buddy first.  get your gear.  sit beside the pool and get to know your mask.  get wet!,  strike a pose.  practice clearing your snorkel.  relax.  practice using the three key fin strokes: the flutter, frog and dolphin.  practice the surface dive.  now you have armed yourself with the basic skills, keep practicing! 

 Before you start actively avoiding questions from anyone, talk to you partner to ensure you are both on the same page. If you have a partner for this pregnancy, let them know what you want and listen to what they want regarding letting others know. Set some rules together regarding how you will each deal with questions. This helps keep your story more consistent, and takes both of your feelings into account.  You may, for example, decide that neither of you will tell friends or coworkers until a certain date, but allow each of you to tell your family on your own terms.; , Oftentimes, people start asking about plans regarding future children if you're recently married or settled. If you don't want people to know you're planning to get pregnant, offer vague answers. Give people enough information that they will feel satisfied without having to go into a detailed plan.For example, say something like, "I think I would want kids sometime in the future" or "My spouse and I are still figuring out the right timing for kids."  , If you're trying to get pregnant, some people may notice changes. You may start eating healthier, for example, or cut out certain foods. If you feel strange outright lying, find ways to side step questions. This way, people may get the hint a certain question is off limits.For example, if someone asks about your sudden health food kick, start talking about new recipes you've found instead of offering an explanation. This will steer the conversation away from questions about your eating habits.  You do not always have to side step uncomfortable questions. White lies can be acceptable, especially with something as sensitive and private as pregnancy. If someone asks why you're abstaining from caffeine, alcohol, or other foods, just make something up.For example, say something like, "Coffee keeps me up at night, so I'm trying to cut back." You can also try something like, "I have a long ride home, so I'm going to skip the wine tonight."  , A close friend or family member may figure out you're trying to conceive. They may see a pregnancy test, for example. You also may want to open up to close friends and family members if you're stressed about the process. If someone finds out, make it clear you want to keep things mostly private for now.For example, say something like, "I really only want a few people to know I'm trying right now, so please don't mention this to anyone else. Thanks!"  

talk to your partner.  answer questions about pregnancy plans vaguely.  find ways to side step uncomfortable questions.  make excuses for dietary changes.  ask close friends and family members to keep things private. 

 Will it be used for a hobby or is it for actual family food preparation? Emergency situations can occur anytime and without warning. Being able to prepare food is one of the primary survival skills everyone should know, at least the basics to sustain life.  The larger the unit, the more food that can be cooked. The design you choose should be practical and functional for your use and needs., Wood, metal, cardboard or a combination of any or all of these.  Cardboard box types are the fastest and easiest to make. Long term need would be better served by using metal. Aluminum is the easiest to work with and is more easily used. Aluminum sheets, aluminum angles, aluminum screws, rubber gasket material, and either clear glass or clear Plexiglas or polystyrene. 2" styrene is used for insulation and is lined with an interior aluminum cooking cabinet. The cabinet should be built to be movable. The oven should have the ability to turn from side to side and have the ability to move up and down to be manually moved into the sun to maintain the interior temperature. An externally mounted thermometer to measure inside temperature to verify the foods internal temperature for safe cooking of meat and prepared food materials.  

decide how it will be used.  determine the size unit you need for your purposes.  choose your materials based off of your previous answers. 

   A typical Russian family will decorate their house in a beautiful and extravagant way including add a glittering Christmas tree. If you are just visiting Russia for New Years, you should go see some of the amazing decorations. However you live in Russia, why not decorate you own place to feel more at home? In particular see the large Christmas tree in Red Square as part of your travels.; ,   During the New Year celebrations, a traditional Russian family will make a sophisticated dinner, with many elaborate dishes, and delicacies. This is a symbol of happiness and abundance for the upcoming year. If you get invited into a Russian home, you're in for an amazing night, however if you're not lucky to get a home stay, visit a traditional Russian restaurant and eat nothing but the most traditional Russian dishes. This will give you, the traveler, to greatest emergence in every facet of Russian culture. Some dishes to try include Borsch, shchi, Piroshki, Blini, and lots and lots of Vodka.    Just before midnight, the Russian President addresses the nation with a short speech in which he reflects on the past year and thanks the people for their support. Right after the speech, the chiming clock on the Kremlin’s Spasskaya Tower is shown counting down the last few seconds of the year.    Local Russians bid farewell to the old year by counting the chimes of the Kremlin Spasskaya Clock Tower. This is broadcast in the moments before the commencement of the New Year. If you are not in Moscow for New Years, get to a public place to watch this broadcast or on television, and in any case after the chimes end sing the National Anthem of Russia. For those outside Russia the Presidential address and the playing of the chimes and the anthem can be watched on cable channel RT.    In Russia, no one goes to bed on New Years Eve, even the children stay up until the early hours of the morning. It is essential to watch the fireworks on New Years, which accompanies with lots of celebrations, vodka and dancing.    Russians welcome the New Year by saying “S Novim Godom!” (С Новым годом!). Alcohol flows freely for the first toast to the New Year. The first toast is simple - "To the New Year, to the new happiness!" (С Новым Годом, с новым счастьем!).    Grandfather Frost – instead of Santa, Russian children believe in the no less mythical Grandfather Frost who wears a long blue or red fur coat, a matching hat and felt boots and carries gifts in a large sack on his back. In addition to the sack with gifts, Grandfather Frost carries a magical staff that has the power to freeze everything around him. Unlike Santa, Grandfather Frost doesn’t rely on reindeer to fly him around, but instead walks and skies a lot (no potbelly!) or drives his magical team of three horses. It is traditional to place two figurines of Grandfather Frost's and his granddaughter, the Snow Maiden, under all Christmas trees. The Snow Maiden wears a blue or white fur coat and has a long blond braid that would make Goldilocks jealous. Grandfather Frost and the Snow Maiden appeared at the children’s party.    It is traditional for gifts to be given after midnight on New Years. Unlike gifts being given on Christmas, they are given and received on New Years. If you're invited to a party, you should bring a gift in the possible chance that you may receive one.    In the Red Square in Moscow is an enormous ice rink. This is the best way to experience all of Russian culture in one experience. Ice skating in the red square is done by all Russians as a tradition and a celebration of the new year. P.S bring a coat because it's going to be cold, but that what's magical about it.    Pilmeni are small meat dumplings that are made in traditional Russian homes the day after New Years. The family and friends will all come together to share in pilmeni and vodka, celebrating the night before and the sharing of love and friendship. If you lucky to be invited into a Russian home the day after New Years, get excited for this delicious Russian "hair of the dog".  

see the decorations.  eat a traditional meal.  listen to the president's address.  bid farewell to the old year.  watch the fireworks.  welcome in the new year.  visit grandfather frost.  give and receive presents.  skate in the red square.  eat pilmeni. 

 Make sure that all members of your household use the same words to train your puppy. If you are using different words from other members of your household, then your puppy may get confused and take longer to learn.For example, to train your dog to sit. Have everyone use the word “sit.” Don’t vary this command at all. In other words, don’t say “sit down” or “stay” to get your puppy to sit. Only use the cue word “sit” or your puppy may become confused.  Make sure that you observe the rules that you have put in place at all times. Do not apply the rules half of the time or bend them on certain occasions.For example, if you do not want the puppy to get up on your furniture, then enforce this rule at all times. If you make him stay off the furniture during the week, but then allow him on the sofa over the weekend, he will end up getting up on the sofa more and more.  Training works best when good behavior is rewarded. You can reward your puppy with a tasty treat, by playing a game with his favorite toy, or by making a fuss over him and praising him. Find out what makes your puppy the happiest and use this to reward him when he does something well.Reward your puppy right away. It is important to give your puppy his reward right after he does what you ask him to do. Over time, you should phase out the treats so that your puppy doesn't get a treat each time he performs the behavior. Doing so teaches him to work harder because he can't take it for granted that he gets a treat every time. Otherwise, he may become lazy. Begin to reduce frequency of treats once your puppy is performing the desired behavior four times out of five.  Clickers are an effective way to reinforce your puppy’s good behavior and let him know that a treat is coming. It is important to reward your puppy’s good behavior right after he has performed it, but it is not always possible to do so. Using a clicker in your training sessions helps you to reinforce good behavior even when you do not have a treat on hand.Start by teaching your puppy to associate the sound of the clicker with getting a reward.  Yelling at your puppy or using physical punishment are not effective ways to get him to change his behavior. Your puppy will not understand what he is being punished for and this may lead to more bad behavior.For example, if your puppy makes a puddle on the floor, don't tell him off. If you do, he will just think that you are angry at him for going potty, rather than realize he has defecated in the wrong spot. Instead of yelling at your puppy if you catch him in the act of defecating in the house, clap your hands to get his attention and make him stop. Then, take him out to his potty spot and wait for him to finish.  Puppies can't concentrate for long, so keep the sessions short. You should limit your puppy’s training sessions to 5 - 10 minutes. Aim for 2-3 training sessions per day to reinforce the behaviors that you want your puppy to learn.Make sure that you use regular activities as opportunities to train your puppy as well. For example, you could ask your puppy to sit before you put his food down, or praise him when he toilets in the right spot outside.  Doing so will make him more likely to respond to you at all times. If your puppy links his name to bad things (such as being told off) this may make him reluctant to come when called. Having a name you use only when he's bad will help you to avoid teaching your puppy negative associations with his 'good' dog name.Use your dog’s actual name when he is being good, but then designate another nickname for when he is being bad. For example, if your dog’s name is Charlie, call him Charlie whenever he is being good. If he is being bad, call him Chuckie.  

decide on training cue words and stick with them.  apply the rules at all times.  find your puppy’s motivation.  use a clicker.  understand that punishment is not an effective training method.  keep training sessions short but regular.  choose a 'good' dog name and a 'bad' dog name: make sure that your puppy associates his name only with good things. 

 Get a liter of diesel (actual diesel, not the fuel additive pictured). Pour it into a can and place the rusty tool (such as stuck pliers, screwed items, etc.) in it for a day.          Remove the soaking tool from the can. Brush if needed, using a brass brush (from Dollar stores, size of a toothbrush). Clean it with an old rag before using, and behold, the tool will work again. Put the lid back on the diesel can and use again for future rusty tools.  

remove rust stains from tools with diesel. 

 If you have difficulty seeing some colors or have a visual impairment that makes the iPhone screen hard to look at, grayscale mode may help. You can do this from the Settings app.   Some people claim that turning your display black and white will help break an iPhone addiction. The reasoning behind this is that color-less images are less appealing, and therefore you're likely to stop using your phone sooner than you normally would.Switching to black and white is not proven to have any effect on your iPhone's battery.; , The black and white image is designed for the visually impaired, so you'll find it in the Accessibility menu.  This will change your screen from all colors to shades of gray. You won't notice it much on the current screen, but the toggle will be gray instead of green.  This will lower the intensity of the whites.  

open the settings app.  select "general" and then "accessibility.",  toggle "grayscale" on.  open the "increase contrast" menu and toggle "reduce white point." 

   This gives you access to your homepage once you log in the Sendspace. From there you can view downloaded and uploaded files, disk space availability and even the number of people you’ve invited to join Sendspace.    This function allows you to edit file details, create file folders and retrieve broken or lost links.

 In this case, we can see that 27 and 12 are both divisible by 3, so we'll separate that out:27x2 - 12 = 3(9x2 - 4)  , To use this method you should be able to take the square root of the terms evenly. (Notice that we'll have left out the negative signs - since these numbers are squares they may be products of positive or two negative numbers)9x2 = 3x * 3x and 4 = 2 * 2  , We'll take the a and c values from our step above - a = 9 and c = 4, then find their square roots - √a = 3 and √c = 2. These are the coefficients for the factor expressions:27x2 - 12 = 3(9x2 - 4) = 3(3x + 2)(3x - 2)  

factor out a greatest common factor if possible.  identify if your equation's coefficients are square numbers.  using the square roots you have identified, write out the factors. 

 If you are an athlete, shower immediately after exercising so that you don’t give the fungus time to grow.The fungus thrives in moist, dark areas.   After showering, dry yourself thoroughly. Use powder to help your skin stay dry for longer.  Avoid tight underwear which will trap moisture between your legs.If you are a man, wear boxers rather than briefs. Change your underwear immediately if you sweat.  The fungus can be spread by skin to skin contact, but it can also spread through cloth., Athlete's foot infections can also spread to the groin and become jock itch. Don’t share footwear or go barefoot in public bathing areas., People with these conditions may be more likely to have it reoccur. These include:Obesity A suppressed immune system Atopic dermatitis  

keep your groin clean and dry.  wear loose clothing.  don’t use other people’s towels in the locker room or share their clothes.  treat athlete’s foot aggressively.  stay vigilant if you have risk factors that may make you particularly vulnerable. 

 Boats can only be found parked on docks. Make your way to the edges of the city where large seaports and small docks can be found.; , Although cops are rarely present around the edges of the city or inside seaports, you still need to check your surroundings for any law officer. If a cop sees you stealing a boat, your wanted level will go up one star.  Approach the boat and stand right beside it while it’s tied to the dock. Press the Y (Xbox), Triangle (PlayStation), or F (PC) button, and your character will jump onto the boat and board it.  Once the boat’s engine starts up, press the Right Trigger (Xbox), L2 (PlayStation), or W (PC) button to accelerate and sail away from the dock.  Cops will chase after you if you stole a boat while an officer is around. To lose the police, look at the mini map on the lower left corner of the screen to check the range of the police, marked by a large flashing circle, that’s chasing you. Just sail straight out of their range and they should give up on chasing you, making the boat yours. 

go to a dock.  look around for cops.  board the boat.  sail away.  lose the cops. 

 If you have long hair, use it to your advantage by sweeping it over the shoulder of the smaller breast. Doing so will visually “pad” the smaller breast, balancing them out and making them appear to be the same size.; , Asymmetry is a perfect tactic you can use to combat unevenness. It works similar to pulling your hair over one shoulder. An asymmetrical shirt has one side that is different than the other. It could be that the shirt’s neckline or hemline swoops lower on one side more than the other. Find an asymmetrical shirt you like. The unevenness of the shirt will work to balance out the unevenness of your breasts.  The sports bra and tight shirt will press your chest down and compress it together. Binding them in this way will minimize the appearance of their unevenness. It’s best to select a sports bra that fits your larger breast comfortably. This will keep the larger breast from spilling out of the bra.  The farther away something is the smaller it appears, while the closer something is the larger it appears. Changing your positioning can help to make your breasts appear the same size. This will help whether you’re out in public, or whether you happen to be naked.   If you’re near other people, position your larger breast away from them. Whether you’re standing or sitting down, you can do this by angling your body so that the shoulder above your smaller breast is directed towards the person or people you’re near. If you’re taking a picture, assume the same posture and put your hand on the hip that is farthest away.  

pull your hair over the shoulder of the smaller breast.  wear an asymmetrical top.  wear a sports bra and a tight shirt to flatten your chest a bit.  change your posture. 

 Lower your eyebrows slightly, but do not allow them to slant inward. This can make you look angry. You should also wrinkle your brow, giving you the appearance of being deep in thought, and squint your eyes slightly. It also may benefit you to keep a straight face.It can take some practice to get a perfect serious expression. Practice in front of the mirror. You can also ask for honest feedback. Take a picture of your serious face and send it to a friend. Have him guess what emotion you're trying to convey.; , Giggling can make you look nervous. It can also make it seem like you're not taking what the other party is saying seriously. Maintain a straight face during conversation.If you have a natural tendency to giggle when nervous, work against it. Focus extra hard on the conversation if you feel the need to giggle creeping in. Keep in mind it's rude not to smile or giggle ever. If a co-worker makes a joke, offer a smile and a brief giggle; however, keep it under control. Uproarious laughter is unlikely to make you look serious. Practicing deep breathing can help you calm yourself and it gives you something to pay attention to if you’re trying to avoid nervous giggling.  Serious people are often quiet and contemplative. It can benefit you to adopt a serious pose when lost in thought.Avoid making eye contact with people around you. Fold your arms and cross your legs. Stay quiet and maintain a serious expression. You do not stay in this pose permanently. You only need to hold it until you work through your thoughts. Holding it too long may look awkward.  During a serious discussion, try not to react to what you hear. Be aware of your face. Try to hold your serious expression, even if someone says something frustrating or upsetting.This can be particularly helpful in a business negotiation. You will look unfazed by the other party's offers, leading them to believe you're not easily intimidated. Keep in mind this technique is not appropriate for every situation. A business meeting, or a school function, may warrant a neutral expression, but it may not be appropriate in in casual conversation. You may come off as rude.  This can make you sound more authoritative, which can be read as serious. A high-pitched tone can make others read you as nervous and less powerful. Try lowering the pitch of your voice slightly, especially in situations that call for you to behave in a serious fashion.Just before you have to act serious, put your lips together and say, "Um huh, um huh" several times. This helps relax your vocal cords, helping you better control your pitch.  This can make others read you as more serious and driven. At work especially, watch your language to make sure you're speaking in a more formal tone.Make sure you use standard English and follow grammatical rules. For example, do not say, "Where are y'all going for drinks after work?" Instead, say, "Where are we going tonight after work?" Avoid slang words and profanity. These will not only make you sound less serious, they can get you in trouble at work. Be polite. Following traditional rules of courtesy can help your professional appearance. In a meeting, for example, say something like, "Excuse me, Mr. Wilson, I'd like to share my thoughts on that matter, if possible."  , Serious people tend to avoid multitasking, as it interferes with their productivity. Give your full attention to a single task before moving on to the next one.It can help to make a schedule for yourself. For example, from 11 to noon, you return emails. From noon to one, you work on a report. Multitasking encourages your brain to divide its attention. It can actually make you less productive, as you'll have trouble focusing enough to complete tasks efficiently.  Often people react to uncomfortable or tense situations by laughing, not because it's funny, but because they don't know how to deal with the tension. If you need to remain serious in an uncomfortable situation, from giving a presentation to going to a funeral service, use thought techniques to keep yourself in check. For instance, try thinking of something serious (like how important this presentation is to your grade or your upcoming promotion), or try thinking about a difficult math equation and try to solve it. This may help distract you from your impulse to giggle and help "sober" you up.  You can also try pinching yourself or biting the inside of your cheek, or taking a long, deep breath to regain your composure.  Your boss or teacher will be impressed if you avoid the distraction of your cell phone, iPad, or other electronic devices. Make a point of abandoning such technologies in areas where you need to act serious.Turn your phone off when you're at your desk or at a meeting. Do not take out your cell phone during work or school. You can catch up on calls or texts after you finish work for the day.  This can make you look reliable, which is a trait associated with serious people. Never miss a deadline or let an obligation fall to the wayside.Take steps to make sure you know your obligations. A calendar, with reminders for certain deadlines, can help. It can be very beneficial to you to look dependable. Dependable people may be more likely to be chosen for certain opportunities.  This will make you look focused and driven, traits associated with the very serious. Keep your workspace clean and always be on top of daily tasks.Take this as an opportunity to do a major overhaul of your workspace. Stop by a local print shop and pick up a variety of folders and files. Organize your work by categories, due dates, and so on.  To-do lists and reminders can help. Leave reminders around your home, office, and workspace regarding deadlines. Keep a to-do list every day and check off tasks as you complete them.  Being serious can be a great advantage in some situations. Socially, however, you may come off as too intense. If people feel uncomfortable around you, this could affect your success.If you act serious during conversations, people may misread this as aloof. Eventually, people may realize you're simply very focused on the conversation, but an initial impression can be hard to shake. Balance out the serious act with cues that show you're listening. Do not cross your arms, or put a bag on your lap. This looks like you're shutting someone out. Make eye contact on occasion, and try to look comfortable. Do not fidget or squirm during conversation.  No one should maintain a serious act all the time. Socially, it's not appropriate to maintain a strictly serious demeanor. Try to loosen up at events where you are meant to relax.Let people into your personal space. Allow for casual touching, like a pat on the shoulder or back. Show people you're listening a little bit more. Respond with comments like, "Hmmm," or, "I see." Nod as a person talks. Soften your facial muscles a bit, abandoning the serious expression. Smile and laugh when appropriate.  People who are highly focused frequently enjoy the outdoors. The tranquility can help you momentarily relax. When you re-enter school or the office, you'll feel recharged enough to get back to acting serious.Go for a walk outside during break time. If you're near a park or woods, walk around there. If you work in the city, take hikes during the weekend. You may have to drive, or take a train, to get out of town.  No one can act serious 24 hours a day. Incorporating breaks into your daily schedule is important to keep you focused when you need to be.Set a reminder on your phone that goes off every 50 minutes, letting you know you need to take a break. Breaks do not have to be long. You can simply get up and stretch for a few minutes, or go get a cup of coffee or tea.  

wear a serious facial expression.  avoid giggling or smiling in conversation.  look serious when you think.  maintain neutrality in conversation.  lower your pitch.  stick to formal language.  concentrate on one thing at a time.  learn to control inappropriate reactions.  establish gadget-free areas.  follow through on tasks.  stay organized.  check your body language in conversation.  lighten up during social gatherings.  spend time in nature.  allow yourself breaks. 

 A window will provide you with a wall to lean against while you sleep.; , A sleep mask will block out artificial light and sunlight, especially if you are traveling during the day.  A pillow may provide additional comfort if you are sleeping in a chair or seat.   Bring a large-sized or full-body pillow if you have booked a seat that provides extra space, such as a seat in the exit row of a bus or airplane. Bring a small neck pillow to use if you are sitting in an aisle seat or if you will be sleeping in locations such as bus stations or airports. A neck pillow may also take up less room in your carry-on bags or luggage. Consider bringing a pillow made of memory-foam, which may be pliable enough to fold up and pack away after using it.  Loose-fitted clothing made of soft material may be the most comfortable for you while you sleep.   Dress in layers to prevent yourself from becoming too cold while you sleep. If your sleeping conditions are too warm, you can remove layers and stow them away for later when you wake.  You may fall asleep easier if you were physically or mentally busy throughout the day.   Consider exercising before you travel, such as walking laps inside of airport terminals. You may also want to wake up early on the day of your travels to go shopping or sight-seeing.  Eating will prevent you from feeling hunger pains as you try to sleep, whereas certain foods can encourage sleepiness.   Eat foods that contain tryptophan such as turkey or almonds, which will naturally induce sleepiness. Eat foods that are high in fiber such as granola, nuts, or dried fruit if you are traveling by airplane because the air pressure in the cabin may adversely affect your gastrointestinal system.  Airplanes and trains may provide dry air that will dehydrate your body and make sleeping difficult.   Stop drinking coffee at least 6 hours before you plan on sleeping because the caffeine may keep you awake in addition to dehydrating your body.  This will prevent flight attendants from waking you up as the plane begins to descend or if the plane experiences turbulence and you are required to wear your seat-belt.

 A letter can be a fun way to let someone know how much you love and appreciate them and that you care. This can be particularly helpful if you tend to get nervous with face-to-face discussions. Try writing a parent a thought out thank you letter letting them know you appreciate them.A thank-you card can be sent in direct response to something.

Don't hesitate to write a letter, or even an email, if you want to let your parents know you care.  This can be great if you're expressing appreciation for a particular occasion. If it's your mom's birthday, for example, a homemade card telling her how much you care can be a great way to show appreciation.You can get art supplies at a local craft store and let your creativity run wild. Decorate the card with designs your parent would like. If you're not artistically-inclined, you can always get a blank card at a gift shop. Inside the card, write a heartfelt letter expressing appreciation. Let your parents know why you appreciate them every day.  The effort you put into an original poem will really show appreciation. If you're feeling creative, try to write a poem for your parents telling them how much you value them. Remember, you don't need to be a master wordsmith to write a nice poem. Your parents will appreciate the time and care you put in to writing them an original poem., Many people use social media to vent frustration and negativity. However, try to use your Facebook or Twitter page to express positivity. Try to post happy memories of your parents online, or post a Facebook status saying exactly why you appreciate your dad.Remember, this may not be as effective if your parents don't follow you on social media.

 A smile can go a long way if you are trying to make a friend in the line at the grocery store or while playing with your dog at the dog park. It signals to strangers that you are pleasant and that you may be approachable.  Say hello to people you might like to befriend. Ask them how their day is going or some other icebreaker.  It is important to show that you are interested in the person you are trying to befriend. Don't just tell them about yourself, instead leave room in the conversation for them to engage. This can be done by asking them questions and waiting for them to answer.  Nobody wants to hang out with someone who is completely timid, but you also don't want to appear completely self-absorbed. Be sure that you are walking the line between the two.  Ask the person what they enjoy doing in their spare time. Suggest a common activity that you both could do together., Haven't we all said that we should do something and then the plans were never solidified? If you really want to hang out with this person, make concrete plans to hang out. If you have a plan you are more likely to actually spend time together.  It may take some commitment on your part to create a new friendship, as people lead busy and hectic lives that don't always lend themselves to new relationships, but don't give up easily. If someone you are trying to befriend cancels plans or doesn't respond to your call or email right away, don't give up. Give people several chances before walking away.  Friendship is not a one way street. While it may fall to you to make the first steps toward a lasting friendship, you should not be doing all the work.   Sometimes you want to be friends with someone but they just don't make the effort to keep the relationship going. One of the biggest benefits of having a friendship is that you feel that someone else likes and cares for you and that you reciprocate those feelings. If this is the case, it may be best to walk away. Find someone else who will give you the kind of friendship you deserve.  

have a pleasant disposition.  greet them pleasantly.  ask them about themselves.  be confident without being cocky.  find a common interest.  make concrete plans.  be persistent but take it slowly.  expect that the person you are befriending will give some effort as well. 

 Gray is shown to have black, spiky hair. You don’t have to permanently dye your hair black to achieve this character’s look. Instead, you can use a temporary or spray dye. It is also an option to purchase a black wig if you don’t feel comfortable changing the color of your hair.Hair dye can be purchased at beauty supply stores, like Sally’s Beauty Supply. Ask for the advice of a professional if you are unsure how to apply the dye or spray to your hair.; , Along with black hair, Gray is shown to have medium length, spiky hair. He has bangs that fall across his forehead and across his eye. The rest of his hair is formed into chunky spikes. To get this look, use a strong gel. Run the gel through individual pieces of hair until most or all of your hair is spiky.Use hairspray for added hold.  Wear color contacts to match Gray's eye color. These can be purchased online, or at a costume store. Make sure the contacts don’t hurt your eyes before wearing them out for the day. You do not have to wear contacts if your eyes are naturally dark blue or a similar color., Though Gray is seen in many outfits, he is often seen wearing a long-sleeved white button-up shirt. Unbutton the shirt so that part of your chest is showing. You don’t have to show your chest, but it's better to unbutton it so people will see your Fairy Tail temporary tattoo.Gray’s character is also known to shed his clothes, so he is often seen shirtless. You can choose not to wear a shirt, but make sure that you abide by dress codes.  It is also an option to wear a long, white coat with your costume. You can wear this as an added layer to your white button-up, or you can wear this as a way to cover up being shirtless underneath the coat. White trench coats can be bought online, at many stores, or you can look for one at a thrift shop.   The coat that Gray wears in the anime has blue stripes down the middle and around the cuffs. You can paint the stripes on with fabric paint, or sew on extra fabric. Gray Fullbuster jackets can be purchased online.  Slim fit jeans with front pockets are ideal. Any type of black jeans will do though. Wear a black belt with the jeans.Gray is also seen wearing short, black parachute type pants tucked into boots.  Most types of black shoes will work for this cosplay. You can wear black sneakers, dress shows, or boots. If you do not own plain, black shoes you can spray paint an old pair that you have, or purchase a pair at a shoe store or thrift shop.  Gray is shown to have a mark that signifies his place in the Fairy Tail Guild. It is a defining part of his look, so it is important to include this into your cosplay. Purchase a temporary tattoo from a cosplay website, or make one yourself. Place it on the upper right side of your chest.If you can’t find or make a temporary tattoo, you can draw the design on with marker. Make sure anything that you use on your skin does not irritate it.  Gray is often depicted wearing a silver cross necklace with a sword edge that has a light blue stone in the middle. A necklace like this will be difficult to find in stores, but you can find one on a cosplay apparel website. If you can’t find or purchase the necklace, any silver necklace with a cross will work.The tip of the necklace should end towards the bottom of your sternum.  In the anime series, Gray’s character is shown with two main weapons. One weapon is a “ice” sword. The other weapon is a “Ice Make” cannon. Choose one prop weapon to carry with you. The cannon is quite large, so the sword may be easier to carry around. If you can’t purchase the props online, it is possible to make them from cardboard, paper mache, and paint.To make the ice sword, cut out a long piece of cardboard with a pointed end. The shape should look like a basic sword. Then, on a separate piece of cardboard or paper draw half of a snowflake and cut it out. Attach it to the sword, about eight inches high onto the cardboard, with glue. Then, paint the sword blue and white. To make the “Ice Make” cannon, you will need to start with a cardboard tube. Then, cut an octagon with a circle in the middle out of foam. Make one more octagon and put the two together to create a three dimensional shape. Attach this octagon to the end of the tube. Then, cut two circular shapes out of foam and attach them together to make a three dimensional shape. Attach this piece three-quarters of the way at the end of the tube. This is the basic shape of the cannon. Next, use smaller circular tubes to make the “screws.” Once the shape is put together, cover the cannon in papier mache, paint it white and blue, and allow it to dry.  

dye your hair black.  spike your hair.  use dark blue eye contacts.  wear a white button-up shirt.  put on a white trench coat.  wear black jeans.  wear black shoes.  purchase a dark blue fairy tail tattoo.  buy a cross necklace.  choose a prop weapon. 

 Though cleaning your skin feels nice, washing your face more than twice a day can make it too dry, which can irritate your face or cause it to overproduce natural oils. This can contribute to acne.Additionally, using too heavy of a touch when washing your face can damage your skin.Use a gentle, non-invasive touch to massage your skin while cleansing.   You may require a more specific regimen for your skin type or history with acne. Ask your dermatologist or doctor about how often you should be cleansing your face.  Your face encounters enough pollution, dirt, and chemicals from the air; it doesn't need contact with other pollutants. Everyday sweat, oil, and bacteria from your hands or clothing can get on your face, where it can block pores. Avoid touching your face in order to keep it clean., Even though it may be tempting, squeezing at blemishes can cause scarring.Pimples are inflammations that do go away on their own over time. Popping them may force bacteria deeper into the inflamed pore, which may result in longer-lasting pimples or scars.If a blemish remains longer than a week, and if it is a real problem, a dermatologist can safely lance it for you, which will avoid further inflammation or scars.  Cleaning your skin removes normal dirt and dust from the environment, but your pores can also be clogged by what you put on your skin deliberately. Remove makeup before you retire for the night, as well as heavy sunscreens. Makeup removers are special cleansers that are formulated to remove heavy or stubborn makeup.   A gentle and effective cleansing at night can remove the need for a morning cleanse--your face will have been on a clean pillow all night, so there will be no need to wash it again.  You can find over-the-counter products that contain retinol, or you can ask for a prescription strength product from your doctor. Retinol will help speed up cell turnover and prevent clogged pores.  Popular retinol-containing creams include Retin A and Differen gel.  If washing with a cleanser that contains benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid is not working for you, try an exfoliating cleansing brush. You can find different kinds of face brushes to use for cleansing, including some that spin. These brushes will clear away dead skin cells to allow your products to better penetrate the skin and clear out your pores., Many products that you already have in your kitchen can help you clean your pores. Baking soda, coconut oil, lemons, avocado, and honey are all great examples.You can even make your own facial products by combining ingredients. For example, you could combine coconut oil, baking soda, and honey for a decadent exfoliating face mask., Noncomedogenic products are those that avoid ingredients that may make acne worse. They are generally labeled as such on the front or back of packaging. Such products are generally oil-free, or do not contain ingredients that contribute to oil build-up.   Your skin type may require products formulated for dry skin, oily skin, sensitive skin, or inflamed skin. Your dermatologist is the best person to ask for advice on medicated or non-medicated products for your skin type.  While they can be pricey, facials are one of the best ways to deep clean your skin and may be able to provide you with the results you're looking for. If you feel like your situation is extreme, a chemical peel will help remove dead skin cells and stimulate new ones to grow, which reduces the appearance of pores.Talk to your esthetician, the skincare expert who will do your facial or chemical peel, about what you need to do before and after your appointment because you will likely need to stay out of the sun and avoid using makeup or other products for a period of time afterwards.  

don't wash your face too much or too hard.  avoid touching your face.  avoid squeezing or picking at pores.  remove makeup before bed.  use retinol.  use an exfoliating brush.  use products from your kitchen.  consider noncomedogenic skin care products.  try a facial or chemical peel. 

 Use a screwdriver or other flat instrument to get under the key, and pull up slightly on one of the edges. You can also use your nail.   If you are working on a laptop (whether PC or Mac), the key is held in place by a flimsy plastic clip, which also serves as the spring. The keys are attached in slightly different ways on each type of keyboard, so removing them will be different on each type.If you're unsure if or how your laptop keys come off, consult your manual.Das keyboards (called by their company the best mechanical keyboards on the market) should not be fixed by prying at the keys. They provide a special clip that will pop individual keys off of the keyboard. Don't remove all the keys at once, as you may have trouble remembering where they all go. Don't do more than a couple at one time.  Clear out any obstructions or crumbs that are jamming the key or the hinges underneath. You can use tweezers or toothpicks to help., Be sure not to have so much alcohol on the swab that it drips., You don't want to leave any liquid underneath the keys, even rubbing alcohol.  Gently press the key down. It should snap back into place.If using a laptop, insert the clip into the position it originally held before you place the key back into its spot.  They should be unstuck now. If not, you may need to take it into someone who repairs computers.  

gently pry up the jammed key.  carefully wipe the inside of the button and the slot from which it was removed.  use a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol to clean off any sticky areas.  let the key and keyboard fully dry.  insert the keys back into their original places.  check your keys. 

 You don’t have to conquer everything at once. You don’t have to work on every muscle group at the same time. While you want to get a balanced workout, maybe choose one or two exercises to begin with to help you start to get comfortable at the gym. Think about something you may already be familiar with or something you’ve always wanted to learn.For example, you may decide you want to focus on barbell squats. Go into the free weight section and choose your weight. You may only be able to do 35 or 45 pounds, and that is great. Spend a few weeks working on your squat. Hopefully by the end of a couple weeks, you feel more comfortable in the gym and want to try other new exercises. You may also decide to focus on the treadmill and the shoulder machine, or doing bicep curls and shoulder presses with hand weights. Don’t worry about the guy next to you who can squat or press hundreds of pounds. You are in the gym, working on your goal. That’s impressive and progress for you.  If you do not feel confident using the hand weights in the free weight weight, grab what you need and move to a different room. It doesn’t matter if you use the weights in the free weight room or another room. Going to a place you feel more comfortable can give you the confidence to get through the workout.Just remember to return the weights after you are finished.  If you are unsure where to begin at the gym, you can set up personal training sessions with the gym trainers. During the sessions, you and the trainer will come up with a workout plan tailored to your fitness level and goals. This can help you feel confident that you are using a plan that will get you results.During training sessions, trainers will be there, coaching and encouraging you. They can help you learn difficult moves and motivate you when you want to give up. Personal training sessions can be expensive, so this may not be an option for everyone.  Group classes are an excellent way to try new things and work towards your fitness goals. Group classes are given at different times throughout the week and cover a wide variety of exercises. During group classes, you will be exercising alongside other people with an instructor taking you through the routine.   Instructors are generally encouraging during classes or stay at front of the exercise room as they do the workout with you. You won’t have instructors hovering over you or yelling at you if you have to stop and rest or modify the exercise. A group exercise class is a good way to try a new exercise in a low-stress, inclusive environment.  When you get to the gym, you should have a workout plan ready. This can help you be more confident. Knowing which machines you want to use, which exercises you want to do, and how many sets and reps you want can help you not feel intimidated or uncomfortable as your workout.Having a plan gives you focus for your workout. You will also have goals, and each time you hit one of your exercise goals, you will feel more confident.  Bringing a friend to the gym can help you feel more confident. Your friend can provide emotional support and motivation, so that you can work out with more confidence. It is always easier to do something that is intimidating when you are not alone.Make sure your friend has the same goal in mind as you, that way you end up exercising instead of talking.  

choose one exercise to focus on.  take the hand weights to a different room.  set up sessions with the personal trainer.  join a group class.  develop a workout plan.  work out with a friend. 

 It's the easiest way and simplest reaction when the immature person is trying to get your attention or a reaction. By responding to the behavior, you're giving in to what she wants and reinforcing her immature actions. Ignoring her will likely make her frustrated with her unsuccessful attack on you, and cause her to give up.   If the immature person is losing her temper or trying to pick an argument, it's important for you to disengage from her efforts to upset you. Look away from her. Turn your head or avert your eyes. Just don’t acknowledge her presence. Turn your back to her. Even if she circles to face you, turn around again. Walk away. Move with a purpose, avoiding her as quickly as possible until she stops following. Try an e-ignore approach. Talking to someone or bothering someone who is constantly on their phone or tablet is very difficult. You’ll be so engaged you won’t notice them.  If the person won’t see reason or won't go away, you may need to be slightly confrontational and tell him that you cannot engage with him any further. Gather up all your courage and politely ask him to leave you alone, while simultaneously removing yourself from the caustic environment. Try one of the following approaches:   Let him off easy by deflecting, “Please leave me alone right now. I’m not in a good mood.” Get to the point and tell him what you’d like, “Leave me alone.” Try a forward approach, “I'm not arguing with you. This conversation is over.” Use the broken record technique. Simply repeat your refusal to engage over and over, "This conversation is over." Remain calm while employing this technique and try to walk away.  It is possible the person doesn't realize she is being immature. Part of maturing is learning to deal with younger and/or less mature people. Confronting the immature person bothering you and letting her know her actions are inappropriate may cause them to avoid you.   Being straight-forward could help, “I do not appreciate your behavior. Please stop.” Simply inform her of her behavior, “You’re being very immature. Stop bugging me.” Form your reply as a question, “Do you realize how immature you’re acting right now?”  , While you may be tempted to respond to the person immaturely as well, giving him a taste of his own medicine, this could seriously backfire. If you are interacting with this person in a work situation, your immature behavior could get you in trouble. In addition, it might actually be dangerous to egg on an immature person who is also aggressive or has a temper. When you feel tempted to react to the person, be the mature one and disengage and walk away from him.  If the person is aggressive and won't stop bothering you, consult with a lawyer or the police. No one is allowed to harass or touch you. These people need outside influences to stop bothering you, and they probably won't until someone is able to exert influence they can't deny. There are a few possible options:   Use your social support network. If contact with the person is unavoidable, find a friend, family member, teacher or school administrator, boss, or anyone you trust, and ask for help. Tell the person you’re going to call the police. The threat of authorities may intimidate him enough to stop bothering you. Call the police. If you fear for your safety and/or the person is harassing you, threatening you, stalking you, or has been violent, the police may be able to intervene, or you may be able to file a police report. Make sure you take detailed notes about each incident so you have a record of the harassment and how long it has been going on. Harassment includes threats; repeated telephone calls, texts, email, leaving notes or other contact; following someone; blackmail; slashing car tires.Consider filing a harassment restraining order. Laws very by state, but you can talk to the police or a lawyer about your options when it comes to filing for a restraining order.  

ignore the person and disengage.  ask the person to leave you alone.  inform the person of her actions.  resist the urge to fight fire with fire.  get help. 

 Most supply lists don't come out until the first day, but its good to get started! Also write down the first day of school, enrollment, etc. The more organized you are, the better!; ,   For supplies you will need basic things like pencils, highlighters, book covers, 3-4 binders (or one for each class), erasers, etc., basically the same things you bought in middle school. Any teacher's requests can be picked up later. Color coordinating by class is an awesome way to stay organized! Pink for English, green for science etc. Read your high school books. High school is much more tougher than middle school so be prepared. Locker organized things may be necessary (bins and things). Avoid shelving until you know how large your locker is and how far classes are from your locker (You might never need to use it!) Pick out your backpack! Make sure it is sturdy enough to last the whole year (or at least most of it) and big enough to hold all your things. A two-strap backpack is recommended, as it is easier on the shoulders.    Find a quiet area that you can do homework, write papers, and overall think in your home. Maybe its the desk in your room or the desk under the stairs. Its entirely up to you! Organize and make the most of this space. Its easier to work when you have a clean space.Add shelving, file boxes, drawers etc. to keep your space organized and as clutter free as possible. Many ideas found on the Internet are rather inexpensive and easy!  , Have a parent go enroll you in school or go enroll yourself(if possible, varies by school district). Pay attention to what bus you will be riding (if riding a bus) and more.  Many of us stay up long into the morning hours in the summer and sleep until noon. Go to bed at a normal time and wake up at your regular time or a time that will give more than enough time to be up and at 'em!  , Put all your things in your backpack.  You want to be you, unique. Pick out something that shows who you are and want to be.  Get at least 9 hours of sleep the night before school.  Breakfast is most important diet, choose some cereals or an omelet.  

make a list of things you need to do, supplies, paperwork to fill out, and things to remember.  grab your supplies list and go shopping!,  set up and/or organize your work space.  get enrolled!,  a week before school starts, get back in your bedtime routine.  the night before, pack your supplies.  pick out your best outfit for the first day.  get a good night's sleep!,  the morning of eat a healthy breakfast. 

 Take a look at people you think are "hot," and note three to six things that make them seem hot. It could be a physical feature (the eyes, the hair) or it could be something they do (the way they walk). Are any of their little tricks ones that you feel you could adapt and use too? If so, adopt them—they will improve as you practice and become part of your style too.   Be careful of becoming a caricature. If you try to adopt somebody's signature look—say, coloring your hair and dressing like the latest popstar confection—people will think "popstar wannabe," not "wow, now that's hot!"; , Remember, the goal here is to be sexually attractive, and that takes some work. Maintain your appearance, learn and maintain good posture, keep your clothes free from "wardrobe malfunctions," (especially if you're on the risk edge of dressing sexily).   Don't make it obvious that you're checking yourself out—that comes across as vain or narcissistic. Be discreet. The important thing is to keep up your appearance of hotness for as much time as possible while you're out and about.  This is a common tip that covers a broad range of activities, from sports to music to hotness. Being considered hot doesn't mean just looking hot, it actually means you need to be hot, and who you are and how you act has almost everything to do with it! If you don't feel hot, there's an easy way around that: visualize your own hotness.   Carry yourself the way hot people do. They don't slouch, or sit in the corner with their arms crossed. They stand up straight. They make animated gestures with their hands. They smile and laugh a lot. That all stems from one key ingredient of hotness: confidence. There is nothing more attractive than confidence, whether you're a man or a woman. Be larger than life. The reason hot people are called "hot" is because of the implication of heat, fire - not just an allusion to sexual energy, but also being passionate and lively in general. Be willing and able to speak your mind, but do it wisely. This requires a modicum of intelligence and the willingness and ability to learn. It is said that it's better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than open your mouth and erase any doubt.  In addition to fitness, looking like you just don't care about yourself is not hot. Externally, that's obvious. Internally, if you don't care about your appearance, it indicates that you don't have much in the way of self esteem or confidence—traits that are not attractive in the short run, nor are they attractive in the long run. What can you do?   Wax or trim your eyebrows, and everything else that looks untidy. Get rid of that unibrow, wax away the upper lip hair, pluck the chin hair, shave your legs, and basically get rid of any hair you can stand to part with except the hair on your head. Modern standards of beauty lean towards overall having no body hair. It helps create the whole smooth-skin look and also makes you look more polished and clean-cut. Don't take it so far, though, that you have to draw on your eyebrows. That's where hot turns into trashy. We all have different facial structures, features we love, and features we hate. Highlight those features that work, and downplay the ones that don't. Applying the right amount of makeup in the right places will do wonders. If you doubt the truth of this, just Google "stars with no makeup," and see how truly ordinary even the hottest of the hot look without makeup. Then understand that hotness mostly radiates from the inside.  Hit the gym, go tanning, and get your laundry done. This trifecta will not make you a better human being, but will be a step towards "hotness." After all, "hotness" is simply shorthand for being sexually desirable, and being physically attractive is what most people look at—initially.    Working out regularly pays big dividends. Is it shallow that we judge others by looks? Of course it is! However, the first thing people see is the "surface" you, so that's where we begin our journey to hotness. In general, people will find you more attractive if you're fit. The benefits don't end there, though. Not only will hitting the gym make you look better, but it'll also help you feel better, help boost your self esteem and confidence (more on that later), and even help you sleep better.  Tanning your hide is not always a bad idea. One hopes you do not aspire to the obvious fake 'n' bake look exhibited by reality show denizens and politicians, but a smooth, even complexion generally makes people more attractive. It doesn't have to be—and probably shouldn't be—too dark, but the tanning effect has the benefit of covering up minor imperfections. To keep skin cancer at bay, consider a professional spray tan. Avoid the orange tan by checking out photos of clients from your local spray tan salon to make sure they know how to get it right.  Laundry day is good for you! It sounds like a terrible bore, but in addition to keeping your clothes clean and wrinkle-free, you will always have the widest possible variety to choose from when you select what you're wearing. Put together outfits that emphasize your best features, and have enough variety to your outfits so that you're not always wearing the same thing.  If you're good at pretending you're hot, congratulations. Eventually (even as soon as the next morning), people will see you disheveled, with no makeup, and sloppy clothes, the veneer stripped away. That's when your real self will be naked and exposed. Don't get so caught up in looking hot that you forget to be a decent person!  

do your homework.  grow into role.  fake it till you make it.  groom yourself well.  shape up.  remember that tricks are temporary! 

 Add 7 cups (1.65 liters) of water to a large pot and bring it to a boil, then remove the pot from the heat., Mix in the ½ cup (118.29 ml) of sugar into the hot water and stir it until it’s completely dissolved. Once the sugar is dissolved, add the 4 tea bags., Let the tea sit and cool until it reaches room temperature. Then take out and discard the tea bags., Pour all of the cooled sweet tea that you just made into a large, clean jar. Then pour 1 cup (236.58 ml) of the unflavored, store-bought kombucha into the jar. If there is a small kombucha scoby forming in the store-bought kombucha bottle, make sure that you add it to the jar as well.If you do have a small scoby in the jar, it will grow from a “baby” scoby to a larger “mother” scoby. Don’t worry if you don’t have a small scoby in the bottle; a scoby will still develop in your jar.  

bring water to a boil.  add sugar and the tea bags to the water.  let the tea cool.  combine the tea and bottled kombucha. 

 A pot of fresh mint plant will also reduce the risk of many pests entering your beautiful home.   Did you know a live mint plant can also prevent rats from entering your house? Possible spots include an area with lot of open windows with vegetation growing on the outer side. Don’t forget to put it at a place with plenty of sunlight!; , Fill an empty sachet with a spoonful of dried mint leaves.   You can either hang the sachet on the ceiling to prevent insects from flying in or place it near the small corners.       This will be an effective method to prevent cockroaches and ants from entering the house.    By mixing the rubbing alcohol to the mint oil at a ratio of five to one, you can successfully guard yourself and your lovely pets from biting insects. Don't forget to shake before use! Crushing the mint leaves and applying the oil directly to the clothes and to the animal fur will also bring effective results against mosquito bites. Check out the tip section below for a detailed description on making an insect repellent with dried mint leaves.    This prevents insect attacks.    One in the mouth after eating will prevent mosquitoes and ants while you sleep outside.    Boil a half cup of water with a spoonful of the dried mint leaves. Adding other herbs such as Lavender will strengthen the repellent. Cool it down for couple of hours. After straining the mint leaves, add the mint liquid to the spray bottle. Add about a half cup of rubbing alcohol to the spray bottle. Shake well and it is ready to use!  

grow a pot of mint leaves to screen the large openings.  design and place a mint sachet to shield the areas that are hard to reach.  create your own customized minty fresh insect repellent spray.  use dry mint leaves in your grain storage.  chew mint leaves.  make an insect repellent spray with the dried mint leaves. 

 In order to reach 9,000 calories a day, you’ll need to focus on getting “the best bang for your buck” in terms of calories per meal. Dietitians call foods with a lot of calories per bite "calorie-dense." These foods will allow you to take in more calories without feeling too stuffed. To stay healthy, focus on calorie-dense foods that also provide a lot of nutritional value.Some examples of nutrient- and calorie-dense foods are:   Nuts Nut butters like peanut or almond butter Dried fruit like banana chips Fresh fruits like mangos and avocados; , Eating isn’t the only way to increase your calorie intake. If you are having trouble maintaining your weight — that is, losing weight despite drinking enough water and getting plenty of calories in solid form — consider high-calorie beverages. Remember, just having high caloric content isn’t the only goal; try to drink calorie-dense beverages that also offer high nutrient content. .   Replace water in your diet with high-calorie fruit juices like apple, grape, or orange juice. Each of them are great options that won't leave you feeling too full. Smoothies are great ways to drink a large number of calories in a healthy fashion. If you can make your own, add protein powder, dense fruits, cream-based liquids and yogurt. Smoothies will move through the stomach quickly and allow you to fuel up prior to exercise. Try to limit your beverage intake during meals to leave more room for calorie-dense foods, but ensure you maintain healthy hydration levels., It’s important to know what your goals are before you begin transitioning to a 9,000 calorie per day diet. Different types of athletes require different types of nutrients to maximize their performance.   If you are training to be an endurance athlete, you should incorporate between 0.5 and 0.7 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight (1.2 to 1.4 g/kg of bodyweight) each day to help your body rebuild the muscle you break down through training. If you are doing heavy weight training, your protein intake should be more like 0.7 to 0.8 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight (1.2 to 1.7 g/kg of bodyweight) every day. This will provide your body with the amino acids it needs to not only restore your damaged muscle, but help your body build new muscle through training.Don’t increase your protein intake at the cost of other important elements of your diet. Developing and maintaining healthy muscle also requires that you take in carbohydrates and healthy fats each day. Ignoring them for the sake of protein can cause your body to use that protein for energy instead of muscle development and retention.It is possible to eat too much protein and some clinicians believe it may cause irreversible damage to your kidneys. The Institute of Medicine recommends that you do not consume greater than 35% of total calories in protein. Additionally, increased dietary protein can result in elevated urinary calcium, which may contribute to bone loss and the subsequent development of osteopenia and osteoporosis., It may seem like the easiest way to increase your calorie intake is to pile on the ice cream and greasy pizza, but eating unhealthy foods in large quantities can lead to other health problems.   Calories aren't the only things that matter. Nutritional value in your foods is just as important. Make sure your diet provides the nutrients you need to be healthy.Junk food and greasy treats can raise your cholesterol and blood pressure. Too much saturated fat can even lead to cardiovascular problems that include heart attack and strokes. Recent studies also suggest saturated fats can affect insulin production in your body and lead to other health problems like diabetes., In order to get all the calories and nutrients you’ll need in a 9,000 calorie a day diet, you’ve got to start early. Plan for seven or eight meals a day, starting right when you get up.   Use lots of eggs — they’re a healthy source of calories and a huge boost to your protein intake. Add a steak to bolster your protein and fats. Include oatmeal or another good source of fiber like granola. Couple your breakfast with whole milk to add calories and fat.  Plan to eat a snack between each major meal. If you feel up to another meal-sized helping, go for it, but if you’re still feeling pretty full from breakfast, try calorie- and nutrient-rich nuts.   Five ounces of walnuts alone can account for nearly 1,000 calories of your daily diet. One serving of oil roasted pecans has nearly 800 calories.One serving of macadamia nuts had 948 calories., Lunch should be one of your bigger meals. If you can, aim for 1,000-2,000 calories at lunch.   Have a carbohydrate-rich soup. Latka Soup can provide over 2,000 calories in a one and a half servings.When choosing foods, remember that your body can only absorb a certain amount of nutrients at once. While three to four chicken breasts might provide up to 1,000 calories, you will only be able to absorb 20 to 30 g of protein, or about the amount of protein in one chicken breast. Don't let focusing only on calories cause you to lose sight of the bigger picture — this amount of chicken is simply too much protein to eat at once.  Even with plenty of protein coming in through eggs, steak and chicken, you may still need more depending on your body weight and fitness goals.   Mass gaining protein shakes are an excellent source of the right nutrients coupled with a load of calories. Many exceed 1,000 – 1,200 calories per serving.If you like making your own smoothies, incorporate protein powder, Greek Yogurt, and cream based liquids with the calorie-dense fruits. Peanut or other nut butters are good choices for added calories, protein, and fat.  As your last substantial meal of the day, dinner is a great opportunity to catch up calories you missed throughout the day.   Take advantage of the protein content in beef. Steak or burgers can be a great source and the condiments you add can provide a significant boost to your overall calorie intake. Couple your main course with a calorie-dense carbohydrate like beans, potatoes, or biscuits.Include vegetables with your dinner. Roasted vegetables are an excellent source of nutrition and fiber. Add butter for increased caloric value.  Midway through your evening you should have a good sense as to whether or not you’re on track with today’s diet. If you have some calories you need to make up, give yourself a cheat meal where you choose things you enjoy eating. Preferably stick to healthy foods, but nothing says you can’t treat yourself from time to time.  Your metabolism does not actually slow down while you sleep, but sleep is when your body does the most repairing and regeneration of muscle mass. Have a snack to make sure your body has a nutrient rich pool of resources to heal.   Walnuts or other nuts make for a great before bed snack. Another protein shake could help make up for any missed protein throughout the day.  The first step toward eating 9,000 calories a day is eating more often than most people do and finding ways to increase the amount of healthy food you can take in per meal.   Don't let more than four hours go by without eating a meal (unless you are sleeping).Eating often will provide you with an opportunity to increase your caloric intake. Drink healthy beverages that have a high caloric content between and with your meals. Fruit juices like apple juice, orange juice, cranberry juice, and grape juice are high in calories and nutrients. Buy bigger plates so meals seem smaller. Silly as it may seem, bigger plates can make it easier to add more food to your plate (and your diet) without it seeming like too much., Sleep is when your body does most of its healing and repairing of bodily tissues, so eating right before bed will ensure your body has fresh nutrients available to maximize tissue production.Your metabolism doesn't actually slow down while you're sleeping, but your body is much less active. A meal before you go to sleep will ensure you use as many calories as you can out of your late night snacks for recovery and regeneration., Lost body heat is one of the biggest energy drains the human body endures regardless of activity level. Adopting a 9,000 calorie daily diet means you're burning at least that many through your metabolism and training, so don't waste some of them on just keeping warm. When you're cold, your body burns calories to create body heat. Avoid the caloric cost keeping you warm by staying that way to begin with.   Stay warm to inhibit the production of thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones aid in uncoupling proteins to create body heat and are also known as one of the stronger metabolism regulating hormones.Stress also increases your metabolism. Stress can release adrenaline and thyroxine which both can speed up your metabolism. Reducing stress will limit your body's production and release of these chemicals., In order to make sure you’re taking in as many calories as possible in a healthy way, start logging what you eat and drink.   There are a number of Apps on the market designed to help you not only track how many calories you take in, but also the amount of nutrients. MyFitnessPal and other similar smartphone apps allows you to scan the barcodes or utilize their food catalog to find the caloric content of your meals. It can provide you with a breakdown of how many calories you’ve eaten and where you may be lacking in nutritional content. It can also let you know when you are exceeding healthy levels of things like sodium or saturated fat.Keeping track of your diet will also help you remember which foods and beverages agreed with you and which didn’t. When striving to increase caloric content to 9,000 calories per day, eating things that make you feel sluggish or sick could interfere with maintaining the calorie intake you planned on.  

choose high-calorie, low-volume foods.  drink your calories.  plan your diet to match your goals.  avoid unhealthy foods.  eat a good breakfast.  have a mid-morning snack.  eat a hearty lunch.  try drinking your afternoon snack.  load up on calories at dinner.  cheat in the evenings.  have a snack before bed.  eat more, and more often.  eat before bed.  stay warm and calm.  keep track of what you eat. 

 Gurgaon is regarded as the commercial Hub of India with large number of industrial giants competing and longing to acquire some amount of space in this magnificent city. These industry giants are desirous to build extremely sophisticated offices accompanied by state-of–the-art amenities.

 Have an idea of what direction you want your conversation with your spouse to go? If you want to embrace being a good listener, you have to get rid of it. Conversations in which two people are participating equally by listening and replying grow organically. Don’t sit down to listen to them with an expectation of guiding the conversation your way. When you do this, you aren’t truly listening.  Sometimes our spouses simply want to come to us to vent or talk through their problems. When you step in with unsolicited, quick-fix suggestions, this belittles your spouse and minimizes their concerns. Avoid offering advice unless your spouse specifically asks you what you think.This especially applies to men. This tends to be a very gendered problem, with husbands seeking to fix their wives’ problems, rather than listening to their wives talk about their problems. For instance, if your wife comes to you with concerns about a disagreement she had with her mother, resist the urge to tell her to simply call her mother and apologize. Instead, actively listen and acknowledge her struggle., The way that you and your spouse communicate and listen to each other will be the model for your kids in their future relationships. Children are sponges for information, so make sure that the model that you’re providing them about how to best communicate with their partner is one of respect and openness.  Your spouse might bring up that you haven’t listened to them in the past. When they mention this, it’s important to not become defensive or angry. Instead, acknowledge that you haven’t been as attentive as you should have been and that you’re working on it. Try asking them what things you specifically do that make them feel that you aren’t listening. This way, if they have specific examples, you’ll have concrete things that you can begin to work on.  If you’ve been neglectful of your spouse in the past and failed to listen to them, then a genuine apology can go a long way. Be sure that your attitude is remorseful and matches your words. Avoid sarcastic or passive-aggressive comments that can seem more like a veiled attack than a genuine apology.   Try saying something like “I know that I haven’t been listening to you. Let’s set a date to go get coffee or lunch/dinner and talk. I want to know what’s going on in your life.” Then be sure to follow up and set concrete plans by picking a date, location, and securing a babysitter (if needed).  Ask your spouse if they feel like you listen to them. You need to be prepared for their answer. Ideally they will say yes, but if they are hurting they might not be kind in their response. Asking them whether they feel like you listen to them can be tough, but it is your most effective means to gauge their perception of how well you listen.  If things aren’t working despite your best efforts to become a better listener for your spouse, then you both might benefit from speaking with a professional. Find a trusted therapist or member of the clergy, and speak with them about your listening and communication related marital problems. They are trained to help couples in this area, and this can be helpful when managing the issues on your own have failed. 

drop your agenda.  don’t feel like you have to fix their problem.  remember the importance of being a good role model.  avoid being defensive about past poor-listening.  apologize and mean it.  ask for feedback.  try marriage counseling. 

 Your best chance to survive the shooting is to get out of the area as fast as possible.Only rule this out if the only escape routes would put you in sight of the shooter.; , Prepare in advance by identifying all exits from the rooms where you spend the most time. This includes emergency exits, fire escapes, and windows. Ideally, plan at least two escape routes out of the school or workplace, in case the shooter is blocking one of them.Don't rule out second story windows, or windows that you would have to break. You can survive cuts from broken glass, or a broken leg from a fall. 98% of shooters act alone. If you can avoid the area where you hear gunfire, you are usually safe.  Don't freeze up or waste time debating your options. Find an escape route, and start running. If you hear gunshots in the distance, you can likely get out of the area before the shooter arrives.   If you have shoes that prevent you from running, take them off.  If you've determined that it's best to run, then forget your wallet, your purse, or your cell phone. Though your first instinct may be to take your possessions with you, none of them are as important as your life.  Do not slow yourself down with evasive maneuvers, such as running in a zig-zag or bending over as you run.Run as fast as you can, directly to safety. These tactics only matter if the shooter is aiming directly at you, and using a weapon with a low rate of fire. Getting away fast is usually the better option.   The one exception is a situation where you are forced to run within sight of the shooter, in an area with plenty of cover between you and the exit. In this case, running from obstacle to obstacle may be your best chance. See the section on hiding for advice on finding cover that will stop a bullet.  As you're running, encourage others to run. If someone looks disoriented or too scared to move, grab that person and drag him with you. Tell the people that running is crucial to their survival. If you're running in a bigger group, it'll be harder to target you individually, and you'll have strength in numbers if you do run up against the shooter.  If you happen to see a sharp object, or a blunt object you can carry while running, grab it. Do not waste time looking for one of these when you could be running. This is only for a last case scenario when you are unable to escape the shooters.  Get as close as you can without being noticed. Grab the barrel with 1 hand and cover the ejection port with the other (try to to keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction). The shooter will pull the trigger and the gun will fire, but only once because the hand covering the ejection port will cause a malfunction and the weapon will not cycle another round. That weapon is now a useless hunk of metal until the shooter can clear and cycle another round in manually (perfect opportunity for you to take the weapon away and subdue the shooter).  

run away whenever possible.  know the escape routes.  react immediately.  forget your belongings.  run directly to the exit.  bring people with you.  grab a weapon only if convenient.  if you have to fight, close distance is your friend. 

 Teenagers probably won’t be able to tell you directly that they are depressed. Help keep an eye on them by listening to how they describe their days, school, friends, or other aspects of their lives.Feelings of sadness, such as crying spells for no apparent reason Feeling hopeless or empty Being in an irritable or annoyed mood Frustration or feelings of anger, even over small matters Loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities Loss of interest in, or conflict with, family and friends Low self-esteem Feelings of worthlessness or guilt Fixation on past failures or exaggerated self-blame or self-criticism Extreme sensitivity to rejection or failure, and having a need for excessive reassurance Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions, and remembering things; , A depressed teenager will show changes in their actions and the way they interact with the world. Just remember that these are signs of depression if they represent changes in behavior.Tiredness and loss of energy Insomnia or sleeping too much Changes in appetite, which can mean decreased appetite and weight loss, or increased cravings for food and weight gain Use of alcohol or drugs Agitation or restlessness such as pacing, hand-wringing or an inability to sit still Slowed thinking, speaking, or body movements Frequently complaining of unexplained body aches and headaches. You may notice this in the form of frequent visits to the school nurse Social isolation Poor school performance or frequent absences from school Neglecting his or her appearance Angry outbursts, disruptive or risky behavior, or other acting-out behaviors  , Depression can arise from a number of conditions in a teenager’s life. When considering if your teenager may be depressed, look for events in the recent past that could be leading to depression. The presence of these things, along with changes in mood or behavior, could be a sign of depression.Look for stressful events in the teenager’s life, such as a death in the family, parental divorce, breaking up with a boyfriend or girlfriend, or doing particularly poorly in school. Consider your family history as well. If your teenager has a blood relative like a parent or grandparent who suffered from depression, bipolar disorder, or alcoholism, he or she is at a greater risk for depression. Having a family member commit suicide, or a generally dysfunctional family can also contribute to depression in teenagers.  Teenagers are dealing with a lot of changes to their bodies and social lives, which can be stressful and difficult to process at times. If you notice signs of depression that have been going on for more than 2 weeks, there may be a more serious issue. On the other hand, occasional appearance of these signs could be typical teenage behavior., People who are suicidal not only have these thoughts, but tend to dwell on them. It will seem like they cannot think about anything else. They will probably talk about being a burden to others, or feeling trapped.More specifically, suicidal thoughts can also be threats to kill oneself, or talking about wanting to kill themselves. A suicidal person might say things like “I’m going to kill myself,” “There’s no reason to live,” or “I wish I were dead.” Suicidal people may also show rage or uncontrollable anger, particularly directed at others, including talking about getting revenge., A person who is suicidal may begin engaging in risky activities, believing they have nothing to live for. These can include using and abusing drugs and alcohol, reckless driving, or knowingly having unsafe sex. Even if the person doesn’t end up attempting suicide, these behaviors make people a danger to themselves and others.Suicidal individuals may also begin withdrawing from others, taking more time for themselves and removing themselves from other people’s lives., If the person has been moody and depressed for sometime, and has suddenly become calm, that could be a sign of trouble. She may have made the decision to end her life, and is no longer agonizing over the decision. You may also notice deliberate activities like giving away personal possessions, or saying goodbye to people., These can be stockpiling pills, or buying a weapon such as a knife or gun. If you notice this, or the person starts talking about getting their hands on these items, you should contact help immediately., If you notice that your teenager is showing signs of depression, sit down and talk to him. Talk about his feelings, and try to determine if he seems capable of managing these feelings, or if it seems to be overwhelming.People don’t always notice they are depressed. In many cases, people who are depressed become self-critical, so they will think of themselves as failures, losers, or bad people. If you don’t ask, the other person may not be able to notice depression alone., When you talk to your teenager, make sure that you are letting him do the talking. The point of this conversation is to let your teenager explain what he is feeling. Avoid the urge to pass judgement or lecture your teenager on what he should be feeling or what he is doing wrong.Your teenager should be doing most of the talking, explaining his feelings. You can ask questions, or offer support. Say things like “I’m here for you,” “What are you feeling?” or “What can I do to help?” This will remind him that he has someone to talk to, and can encourage more communication.Acknowledge his feelings. Don’t use this as an opportunity to prove your teenager wrong, or to say “Things aren’t like that,” or “It’s all in your head,” even if you believe his concerns are irrational. You want him to feel understood and supported, so for now it is important to let him know that you are listening to him., If you think your teenager is suffering from depression, you should go see a medical professional. The doctor will run a series of tests, including a physical exam, blood test, and psychological evaluation in order to determine if your teen should be diagnosed with depression. Depending on what the doctor finds, your teenager may be diagnosed with depression and have treatment prescribed.Make sure you talk to the doctor about what your role should be in helping to treat and care for a teenager suffering from depression.  One of the common signs of depression is withdrawing from friends and social activities. While your teenager is undergoing treatment from a doctor, make sure she spends time with other people. It can also be helpful to give your teenager something to do. Suggest she do something with friends, or invite her along for errands or other outside activities., Depression can get worse when accompanied by bad physical habits. Inactivity, not enough sleep, or bad nutrition, which are all problems for teenagers in normal circumstances. In addition to being a sounding board, make sure your teenager is getting the right kind of physical activity to stay healthy.Regular physical activity can help reduce depression, and is generally healthy for you. Encourage your teenager to get an hour of aerobic activity every day, such as running, swimming, or even just walking. These can even be things you do together. Keep an eye on screen time. Electronic devices like computers and television can limit people’s exposure to others, and provide avenues for depression triggers like cyberbullying or negative or violent content. Make sure your teenager is getting time away from screens to interact with real people, including friends and family. Make sure your teenager is getting a good night’s sleep. Strictly enforce a curfew, and make sure your teenager is going to bed when they should. Spending a lot of time on electronic devices like televisions or phones can really hurt a sleep cycle.  

listen for emotional signs.  watch for behavioral changes.  look for triggers.  take note of how long these symptoms have been around.  listen for suicidal thoughts.  watch for reckless or dangerous behavior.  keep an eye out for sudden improvement.  check if the person has the means to commit suicide.  talk with your teenager about the signs.  listen to what your teenager says.  visit a doctor.  encourage social connections.  find ways to help your teenager physically. 

 Hot flashes can come at any time and last anywhere from a few minutes to an hour. To ensure you are prepared for a sudden change in your body temperature, you should opt for clothing that is breathable and loose fitting. Look for clothing that has “wicking” or “cooling” on the label. Go for clothing in fabrics like linen or cotton and avoid synthetic materials like polyester or nylon.For example, you may wear tops and dresses made of linen that are flowing and loose fitting. Or you may wear loose cotton sweaters and cotton dress pants so you do not get too hot during a hot flash.; , Hot flashes can also cause you to feel hot one moment and then chilly or cold the next moment. To help regulate your body temperature when you have hot flashes, dress in layers. This way, you can shed a layer when you feel hot and put a layer back on when you feel chilled or cold. You may plan your outfits around layering so you can shed a layer and still look professional at work.For example, you may wear a nice cotton top with a pair of cotton dress pants and then also put on a nice cotton sweater that you can shed if you get too hot. Or you may wear a linen dress with a cotton blazer that you can take off if you get hot during a meeting at work.  Sometimes you are not able to shed enough clothing at work to feel comfortable and you may end up sweating in your clothing. If you are worried about appearing unprofessional at work after a hot flash, you may keep a clothing in a desk drawer that you can change into in the bathroom. This way, you can still look put together at your meeting later in the day, with no sweat lines to be seen.   For example, you may store a more professional outfit at your desk, such as a clean cotton collared top and dress pants, as well as a more casual outfit, such as a cotton sweater and loose pants. Then, you can change into either outfit depending on what you are doing that day at work.  

wear loose fitting, breathable clothing.  dress in layers.  store extra clothing at work for a quick wardrobe change. 

 One of the 10mm bolt that will be removed later was covered (hidden) but is now "found" under that hose.  Or you could get them up from the ports if you find a way to use a piece of hose inserted snugly over each spark plug after each is unscrewed.  Do this carefully to keep from breaking or dropping the spark plugs especially if you want to reuse them. , You use a small but powerful impact wrench to loosen it., With the spark plugs out, you would then reconnect the battery for just the next few moments to cause a very little "bump" of the starter motor by a momentary bump of a "remote push-button starter switch" or by wiggling the ignition switch to "nudge and thump" the pulley bolt a very small amount (bump) while a socket wrench (not held by hand or foot) is lodged onto the bolt as explained below.  Caution: do not hold the wrench by hand if you are power bumping it loose with the starter motor. To do that position a breakover wrench with about 2.5ft (75cm) cheater pipe (like 1 or 1.5 inch steel conduit tubing) extending it and positioned at about a 45 degree angle down toward the front of the car to be held firmly against the floor or earth, blocked in place with large stones, or by being inserted in an opening of a concrete block and blocked in and about by heavy toolboxes to keep the cheater from sliding out or from side to side -- but no hands or feet trying to hold it.Bump the ignition switch (turn momentarily) to make starter motor "bump." Then see whether it loosened the bolt--but if not then check that its still on correctly and lined up and try it again. It may loosen on the first two or three tries, when it loosens enough you'll probably hear a something like a little "zinging/whizzing" sound. So don't have loud music/talk, etc. -- beware, aware. Caution: Disconnect the negative battery terminal again after this technique so your engine can not be accidentally "bumped" or turned away from TDC (top dead center) by the starter motor in error.  

remove two short 10mm bolts (all bolts should be hex-head, unless some newer models use torx/star bolt heads) holding the power steering hose on where it crosses the valve cover and work the hose toward the left out of the way for removing the valve cover in a later step.  remove spark plugs use a spark plug socket with a rubber grommet inside the socket so that it helps to lift plugs them out of the deep access ports.prevent dirt, trash or any screws (or ceramic-glass pieces if you broke a spark plug) from falling into the cylinders any of which could cause very serious damage to the engine.  loosen the harmonic pulley (but do not remove it at this time) retainer bolt (21mm, 13/16 inch) but keep it in but "finger-tight" (snug).  consider using the power of the starter motor (only with the spark plugs taken out -- not holding the wrench by hand or foot). 

 Of course, you can’t say, "So I was in this bar and this woman bought me a drink" and then smirk like an idiot. The story needs to accomplish a few things:   Show that women have offered to buy you drinks in the past. Some women will think that a girl buying a guy a drink is an outlandish idea. Talking casually about how it's happened to you in the past can make her wonder "Oh, maybe it happens more often than I thought...". Show that you're selective. When you get to the part where the girl in the past offered to buy you a drink, say something like "So I agreed." It implants in the woman’s mind that you don’t just let anybody buy you a drink. Elevate the other woman's status. By saying that the woman who bought you a drink was attractive, smart, and cool, you're showing that she wasn't doing it because she was pathetic or desperate. You're also making it clear that you still respect her, if not more so, after she bought you a drink. Compare her to the woman who bought you a drink. Since you already spoke highly of the other woman, by comparing the two, you're giving her an underhanded compliment. Plus, people are more likely to do something if they know that others who are similar to them have done it already. Here is an example of a story that weaves in a few of these elements:  Check this out. I was at this bar the other night and I met this really cool girl and we hit it off so she offered to buy me a drink. So I agreed and we walked over to the bar and I told her since she's buying, she has to choose the drink. She gave like this evil smile that made me worried, kind of like your smile, and she ordered something I can’t even pronounce from the bartender. Then the bartender started smiling and I was like, holy $#&#. This cannot be good. So the bartender mixed a bunch of stuff up and put it together and then I swear, he lit it on fire, and while it’s still on fire this girl tells me to down it! So we both downed it and I felt fine - till like 30 seconds later - I don’t think I've ever been that drunk from one drink in my entire life! A great night though!  ; , A presupposition is a statement where you assume that the person is going to do something. Here are the presuppositions in this sentence:   That she will buy you a drink. Study the syntax closely. Saying "...when you buy me a drink" assumes just that. The "if" right before it applies to if it'll be exciting, and having that "if" in there keeps you from sounding too sure of yourself. That she is creative. That you two, together, will think of something.  If a girl happens to say something like, “Do you want to go get a drink?” or “Let’s go get drinks” say: “Yeah! That sounds great, I’ll take a jack and coke” or whatever drink you want. If you say this with conviction as if you really mistook her meaning, it'll probably work, because most people won't say "No, I meant YOU buy" or "Give me the cash for it." If it doesn't work, fall back on "You get the first round and I’ll get the second." You'll end up paying for the next round but hey, you still got her to treat, rather than you buying everything.  This is a common game played by pick up artists, but there is no reason you cannot use it to just have fun. Here is how you do it...   You: Hey, we're going to make a little bet. We're going to play a game- basically I'm going to ask you five questions and you have to answer each one of them falsely! If you answer it truthfully then you lose and you buy me a drink. If you win I buy you a drink. Deal? Her: Deal! You: Excellent. So where are you from? Her: Jersey. You: How old are you? Her: 75. You: Okay, what kind of car do you drive? Her: A Honda. You: How many people are in your family? Her: 25. You: Dang! (Reach for your wallet as if you are about to buy her a drink) Have you ever played this game before? Her: No. You: And I got you on the fifth question. (Unless she claims that she really has, in fact, played this game before. Then you get to prove she hasn't!)  ,   You: We're going to play a game. Basically you can't say the number 17! If you do you buy me a drink. Deal? Her: Deal. You: Excellent. What’s 2+2? Her: 4. You: What’s 4+4? Her: 8. You: What’s 8+8? Her: 16. You: What is 20+20? Her: 40. You: What is 40+40? Her: 80. You: What is 80-4? Her: 76. You: What is 76-6? Her: 70. You: Ha! You owe me a drink! I got you to say 70. Her: No! You said 17 not 70! You: ….and you just said it right there! I’ll take a jack and coke.  

tell a story where a different woman bought you a drink.  follow up with a challenge, laced with presuppositions: "i doubt if when you buy me a drink it'll be that exciting but i'm sure that with a little creativity we can think of something..." if you look closely, this is a sentence made up of presuppositions.  assume her generosity.  play the 5 questions game.  play the #17 game. 

 If your tank is harboring red slime algae, the first step is to replace the nutrient-rich water in your aquarium with clean saltwater. You can do this by performing a partial water exchange.Aim to remove and replace about 10% to 20% of the tank's water. In a 10 gallon tank, that means about one or two gallons, which should be sufficient to ensure healthy water.Remove as much organic material and detritus from the tank's substrate as possible. Using a vacuum tube can be helpful here at removing debris from the gravel or sand at the bottom of the tank. Make sure you also scrape away any red slime algae that's clinging to the underwater surfaces inside your tank.; , Even if you've performed a partial water change, the tank may still be a breeding ground for red slime algae. Adding clean water isn't always enough, because the nutrients that algae feed off of are often lurking elsewhere in the aquarium, especially amid the gravel or sand at the bottom of your tank.If you can afford it, an under-gravel filter might be a great way to constantly remove excess debris from the gravel or sand. A gravel vacuum can be useful for sucking out debris that settles in the gravel. You can also use a siphon to clean out the substrate of your aquarium.You can find siphons at many pet stores or by searching online. Introducing orange-spotted sleepers and pistol shrimp to your aquarium can be helpful if you use sand as a substrate instead of gravel. These creatures tend to sift through the bottom of the aquarium and stir up the red slime algae, allowing your tank's filters to catch and extract it all out of the water.  If your tank is experiencing algal growth, it's important to take care of the water in your tank. However, algae that's already clinging to the tank can end up growing and blooming more, even if you're treating the water. Part of any red slime algae eradication should involve scraping away the algae that is clinging to your tank's walls and other internal surfaces.You can purchase a specialized scraper, like a Mag-Float, Algae Magnet Cleaner, or Kent Pro scraper. These scrapers are available at many pet stores. If you cannot find one at your local pet store you can purchase one through an online retailer. You can also try using the edge of an old credit card in a pinch, as this can help manually remove caked-on algae the same way a scraper would.  A dirty filter is often the culprit behind algal blooms in an aquarium. If you're experiencing red slime algae, make sure you clean the filter as part of your algae eradication efforts.The media inside mechanical filters will need to be cleaned whenever they become dirty, and once the residue no longer washes off the filter it will need to be replaced. If your tank has a dirty filter, the organic waste trapped inside could be releasing ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate into your tank's water.  One of the biggest causes of red slime algae is the presence of organic debris (like left over food, fish waste, etc.) in the water column. Protein skimmers may be more effective than a regular filter at removing these materials from the tank's water.Protein skimmers pull out organic waste and will not allow that waste (or its chemical byproducts) to be released back into the tank's water, which may be a problem with other mechanical filters.Large external skimmers are the most effective at removing organic waste, but they must be properly adjusted to your tank. If they are not adjusted, they may leak a substantial amount of water onto the floor of your home. You can buy a protein skimmer at many pet stores or through online retailers.  Excess food is one of the most common sources of elevated phosphate in your aquarium. As that phosphate permeates the water, it creates an ideal environment for algae to bloom, which can make a mess out of your tank.It's important to watch how long it takes your fish to consume the food you give them. If a few minutes have passed and there's still excess food that's not being eaten, that food will settle in the substrate of your aquarium. Try feeding your fish one larger meal each day, or offer smaller portions if you want to continue feeding your fish multiple times each day., Because plants compete with algae for resources like light and nutrients in the water, they can help reduce or prevent algal blooms in an aquarium.As these plants take in nutrients like phosphorous and carbon dioxide, they produce oxygen, ensuring a cleaner, healthier environment.Sea grass and mangrove plants make excellent aquarium additions.Certain macro algae species can also be good at oxygenating marine aquariums. These algae are healthy and helpful additions to an aquarium, and can help displace red slime algae. Some good macro algae species to try planting include caulerpa sertularioides, calupera asmeadia, and caulerpa mexicana., While light is necessary for most aquatic plants to survive, too much light exposure inside an aquarium can create an environment that allows algal blooms.This usually only becomes a problem with prolonged and close-range light exposure, and certain precautions can be taken to ensure a healthy tank.   Tanks should not be exposed to lights for more than 6 to 10 hours each day for ornamental aquarium setups, or 10 to 14 hours each day for planted aquariums.Try keeping lights on a timer if you're having trouble regulating the light cycle. Make sure you change your light bulbs at least once every year. As lightbulbs age they lose their spectrum and intensity, which may promote algal blooms.  If your aquarium seems to keep spawning new algal blooms no matter how much you clean the tank and limit food, it could be a problem with your tap water. It's generally a good idea to test your tap water to see if it may be contributing to the problem or causing it directly.You can test your water at home by buying a water quality test kit. These can easily be found online and may be available in your local pet store. Phosphate is commonly added to municipal water supplies to help prevent pipe corrosion. It can also show up in well water if it leaches through the ground from yard fertilizers.Elevated levels of phosphates in your tap water can promote algal blooms in your aquarium.If your water is the problem, you can purchase a reverse osmosis water filter or other tap water filtration system. These are available at many home improvement stores or online.  It's important to control the movement of water through your tank to ensure a healthy environment. Water flow will help keep the tank more oxygenated, but water that flows too fast can also have some negative consequences.If water does not flow quickly enough, it can become stagnant and less oxygenated. When water flows too quickly, it can sweep away food into the tank's filtration system before fish have had a chance to finish eating it. Once inside the filter, this food will decompose and release additional phosphorous. A powerhead or wave-making device can help improve water quality by increasing the rate of movement within your tank.Talk to an aquarium service expert about determining the proper flow rate for the size and type of aquarium you are managing. You can find experts online or by searching in your local phone book.  Performing regular partial-water exchanges helps ensure a healthy environment. It's not so shocking to fish as having an entirely new tank full of water, but it's enough to keep the levels of nitrates and phosphorous down and remove dissolved organic material by displacing old water with cleaner, more-oxygenated water.Remember to only add salinated water to your marine aquarium. Aquarium salt can be purchased at most pet stores or through online retailers and mixed into your water at home. Pour the new seawater into your tank very slowly. A rush of incoming water can frighten fish and could disturb the ecosystem.  Part of keeping an algae-free aquarium should involve regulating your tank's pH on a regular basis. A slightly basic environment (meaning a slightly higher pH) can help prevent red slime algae from growing rapidly/aggressively once it has shown up in your tank.Most marine tanks should have a pH somewhere between 8.1 and 8.4. You can adjust the pH with buffers or kalkwasser as needed. You can buy a water pH testing kit at most pet stores that sell aquarium supplies. You can also purchase them through most online retailers. Check the pH every time you perform a partial water exchange and adjust the water's pH accordingly.  If you do a partial water change but don't clean your filter, the clean water will just be running through a dirty filter. This will reintroduce a lot of the nutrients and organic debris that you've worked so hard to remove from the tank.You should clean your filter every time you do a partial water change. Some tank owners rinse the filter's media in a bucket of wastewater that's been removed from the tank so that the healthy bacteria on the media is not lost. Other tank owners may prefer running the filter's media under a faucet to blast away debris and detritus, though this may damage the bacterial colonies. Whichever method you choose, proceed with caution so that the bacterial colonies are protected, but make sure you remove all of the organic detritus/debris (or as much as possible).  

perform a partial water exchange.  remove settled organic debris from the tank's substrate.  scrape off excess red slime algae clinging to your tank.  clean your filter.  try using a protein skimmer in your tank.  limit how much you feed your fish.  add aquatic plants to your aquarium.  limit overhead light exposure to your aquarium.  check your tap water.  improve the movement of water in your tank.  perform weekly partial-water exchanges.  test your tank's ph.  clean your filter regularly. 

 Depending on local government requirements, you may find you only need a business license, but some jurisdictions will require you to obtain professional licenses specific to the type of work you do. Subcontractors working on construction projects, for example, may be require to have a Contractor's License in certain jurisdictions.; , Much information is available from small business advocacy groups, local regulatory offices, and even the public library. Because laws and regulations vary greatly depending on the type of work you will be subcontracting, specific details are not in the scope of this article.  Subcontractors may also be required to have risk indemnification, workman's compensation insurance, and other coverages specific to their work.  In construction, a subcontractor may be able, for example, to exercise a builder's lien against a general contractor on a project to insure he is paid in full for work performed. , Subcontractors are more likely to work off-site. Employees generally work on-site under direct control of the employer. To be a successful subcontractor you may find you have to travel to pursue your desired work.  Subcontractors may set their own hours and how and when the work will be performed, depending on the project schedule and contractual requirements.  Subcontractors pay all of their expenses and bill for reimbursement for the job. By contrast, employers may pay an employee’s expenses, such as travel costs, lodging, and meals when working away from home.   Subcontractors may provide all of their own equipment, whereas an employer usually pays for all supplies and equipment required for the job.  A subcontractor gets their own customers, while an employer generally provides the customers.  Subcontractors seek out and pay for their own training.  Subcontractors receive the full contracted pay for the job whereas employers pay salaries or wages for the job.   Subcontractors are responsible to pay all of their taxes. This is in contrast to employers, who have to withhold taxes from an employee.  

obtain all necessary licenses.  learn all the rules and laws for the type of work you will do.  obtain liability insurance: in most cases, subcontractors pay for their own liability insurance as opposed to an employer who provides this for their employees.  know all the laws and know your rights as subcontractor or employee to protect yourself from those who might try to take advantage of you.  make sure your subcontract agreement covers the entire scope of work of your project, scheduling requirements, insurance requirements, performance bonding, materials furnished by you/by others, and details of how and when you will be paid for completed work.  ,  be prepared to work in different places.  set your hours as required.  have adequate cash flow.  find your clients.  expect to have to keep improving yourself.  understand the finances.

 Before diving in to whip up dinner, take a moment to visualize each task. Check your recipe or estimate how long everything will take to preheat, prep, and cook so you can figure out how to multitask your meal.Form a quick strategy and map everything out. Can you slice the onions while the oven preheats, saucepan gets hot, and butter melts? Maybe you can season the salmon and pop it in the oven while you caramelize the onions for a quick sauce. Then, five minutes before the salmon’s done, warm the potatoes and carrots you roasted this morning. Just before taking the fish out of the oven, deglaze the onions with some white wine and add herbs to finish the sauce.    , If you have kids, cut down on your prep work by having them perform age-appropriate tasks, like washing or chopping veggies or whisking up a dressing. In addition to organizing and dividing the labor, you’ll spend quality time together.You could also invite a friend over to cook together. Prep and cooking will go faster, and you can socialize without spending the money you would at a restaurant., Peels, stems, eggshells, trimmings, wrappers, and other odds and ends inevitably pile up when prepping and cooking meals. Instead of running back and forth to the trash can, keep a large bowl or container by your prep area so you can quickly toss away scraps.Since you won’t be running across your kitchen with handfuls of food scraps, you’ll probably keep your floor cleaner, too.  

take a minute to strategize before you start cooking.  delegate tasks to family members.  use a countertop garbage bowl.

 Children need to be taught what will be tolerated and what will not. Avoid straying from what constitutes a broken rule as much as possible. Children learn early on how to manipulate and are great at twisting words to benefit themselves.  Children will test how far they can push the limits so expect some resistance and stand firm.  All actions do not warrant the same consequences but children can easily learn what to expect from different actions.  It is often difficult to determine who is to blame for an incident because generally those involved are all to blame to some degree. Once a rule has been broken, always enforce the consequences.  Age differences should be taken into consideration sometimes. Chastising a 10 year old with the same consequences given to a 3 year old is just not practical.  

set rules in place.  teach your children where you draw the line.  set clear consequences for certain actions.  stick to your policies.  keep in mind that children do not have to be treated equally.

 The easiest way to scratch your back is to simply try and do so yourself. You can do this by reaching one or two hands behind your back and trying to find the spot that itches. If the scratch is on your shoulders, lower back, or upper back, you may be able to scratch it on your own., Be gentle when scratching. Vigorous scratching can break the skin, irritating it further. This can cause further itchiness down the road.   Scratch your itch lightly, using gentle motions with your finger. It may be a good idea to trim your nails prior to scratching.If you begin to feel pain, stop scratching. Scratching can feel very satisfying, but you want to resist the urge to over-scratch the itch, as this can break the skin.  While scratching can be satisfying, you should avoid scratching your itch too frequently. Scratching at an itch too much will not alleviate the itch. If an infection or rash is causing the itch, this will actually make it worse.You can trim your nails very short or wear oven mitts to deter yourself from scratching an itch too deeply.Watch for signs of infection, like redness, swelling, scaling, or warmness around the infected area.  An itch in the middle of your back may be difficult to reach alone. You can ask a friend, family member, or significant other to assist you. Ask that this person scratch your back for you and help direct them to where the itch is. Request that this person not scratch the itch too hard. You do not want to make the itchiness worse.  

try to reach the itch yourself.  do not scratch too hard.  minimize scratching.  ask a friend for help. 

 You can cut the cake into half or thirds for a start and use creativity on how small you want the pieces to be. Each piece represents a block.  Make them look like stacking blocks that have been dropped on the tray; they don't have to line up perfectly!  , Choose a different color for each cake block. Use a frosting knife to spread a thin layer of frosting to cover each block. Place the tray of blocks in the refrigerator while you prepare the marshmallows.  The marshmallow halves will make up the nodes on the blocks. Make enough marshmallow halves so that the square cake pieces each get 4 halves, the big rectangles get 6, and the small rectangles get 2., Remove the cake blocks from the refrigerator. Take a marshmallow half and spread a thin layer of icing coordinated with the frosting color of the cake block you're decorating. For example, if you're working with a cake block you frosted in blue, use blue frosting on the marshmallow half. Continuing in this way, place the marshmallow halves in even rows on the cake blocks so that each block has the correct number of halves.  Use the rest of the frosting to spread another layer over the cake blocks, this time covering the marshmallows as well. Continue until all of the cake blocks have been neatly frosted.,, 

cut the cooled cake into squares and rectangles.  arrange the cake blocks on a large tray.  frost the cake blocks.  cut each marshmallow in half.  add the marshmallow half to the blocks.  finish frosting the cake.  place the finished cake in the refrigerator until ready to serve.  ,  finished.

 For the remainder of the lesson, this article uses the C-major pentatonic scale. The first form of the scale, started on the 8th fret, looks like this. Pay special attention to the root notes (each one is another C), in bold.          e|---------------------8-10------------| B|-----------------8-10----------------| G|--------------7-9--------------------| D|---------7-10------------------------| A|-----7-10----------------------------| E|-8-10--------------------------------|; , The following scale, again in C-major, has it's root on the 4th string. The root (C note) of this scale is actually the second root of the normal C-major pentatonic shown above -- so you can already see how they would be easy to switch back and forth from. Again, other root notes are bolded.          e|---------------------10-12-----------| B|-----------------10-13--------------| G|--------------9-12------------------| D|---------10-12----------------------| A|----10-12----------------------------| E|-10-12-------------------------------|  , Root notes are the notes that match your key and are the beginning of the scale. As such, they form great bridges between different scale shapes, and they are the "home base" you need to return to keep the song in key. Find as many root notes as you can -- they often lead to even more scale shapes.          Root notes always repeat every five notes in the scale. Pentatonic means "five tones," so each note repeats every five steps.  Knowing how the chords lay over your scale can help you find notes, play rhythm guitar, and remember the scale shape. The two chord shapes for these scales are:           1st position -- C-Major Barre Chord: Barre the eighth fret with your index finger. Your ring and pinkie go on the 5th and 4th strings, 2nd fret. Your middle finger is on the 3rd string, 9th fret.  2nd position -- D-Major Shape C-Major Chord: Your index finger is on the 4th string, 10th fret. Middle finger on the 3rd string, 12th fret. Pinkie on the 2nd string, 13th fret, and your ring finger is on the 1st string, 12th fret. This resembles an open D-major chord., You can start these chords and scales on any note on the 6th string to change the key. The tips above, and below, are not strictly limited to C-major. You could, for example, start on the 5th fret to put everything in A-major.         

reacquaint yourself with the basic major pentatonic scale.  get comfortable with a second position pentatonic scale.  review the root notes in the scales above.  visualize the chords that fit over each pentatonic shape to help memorize them.  know that these shapes can be moved into any key. 

 Set goals for each day, and create a plan that will help you achieve your goals efficiently so as not to waste a minute. Planning ahead will help increase productivity, giving you more energy and time to meet your goals., Stay organized and silence your cell phone. Focus on a single task at a time and follow it through to the end. Release yourself from a standard of perfection, and allow that as long as everything has a place and you are able to find it when needed, your system will work for you.Multi-tasking can actually make you less productive and can waste your time. Make a list of everything you need to accomplish, and tackle them one task at a time. Spending time with organized people can motivate you to become more organized. An organized friend can not only inspire you, but can also hold you accountable for your messy habits., Limit your time online, and limit other time-wasting distractions, such as television, so that you can stay on track. Refrain from constantly being connected to the Internet and instead check your email only periodically. Creating a list of manageable goals can help you to determine how to spend your time more effectively.Take short breaks between each task and reward yourself for completed goals in order to motivate yourself. Set yourself up to be accountable for your actions by letting others know your goals. Checking in periodically with a supportive friend can help you stay focused and on track.Give yourself rewards for accomplished goals. You deserve to celebrate even your small successes, since each step you take is a move closer to your larger goal. Staying aware of how far you have come can help you to believe you will reach each of your goals.  Limiting yourself and refusing to take on challenges can be wasteful, impeding your progress and growth. Jump at any chances to improve yourself and make the most of them. Say “yes” to something new, and take a risk. Network with friends and peers to improve your career options. Ask for that cute stranger’s number.Attend networking events with an open mind, and try to interact with people whom you think you can help, rather than those who might be able to help you in order to make the most meaningful connections., Resigning yourself to someone else’s expectations for you is a waste of your time. Discover what you are passionate about and spend time doing what you love. Expand your horizons to find where you belong and where you should expend your energy., Stop wasting energy on people who drain you, and instead prioritize the people who make you feel safe, loved, and respected. Be deliberate in who you make the effort for, since some people are more selfish than others. If you find that being around a certain person drains your energy and gives you feelings of negativity, distance yourself or remove this person from your life.Realize that your time and attention is valuable, and that you deserve only the best. If someone is treating you in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable, you should communicate this to them. Reward yourself for making moves toward distancing yourself from this toxic relationship.You need to put yourself first, since you are your strongest ally in life. Don't make excuses for other people's poor behavior. Just because someone is unable to give you the love you deserve, doesn't mean that you are unlovable. Release yourself from toxic relationships so that you can make room for the right person to enter your life.  Cutting ties with someone close to you is never easy, but it is necessary to our growth. Try writing about how you feel, and distracting yourself by walking in nature. Talk to a trusted friend or family member; it is never shameful to ask for help.It is perfectly normal and healthy to cry, so don't hold back from expressing your emotions. Remember that you are loved and valuable. Take great care of yourself so that others can learn how to take care of your needs in the best possible way.  

plan ahead.  reduce time-wasting habits.  prevent procrastination.  take advantage of opportunities.  avoid limiting your potential.  end any unhealthy relationships.  embrace the pain of an ending and remain hopeful for new beginnings. 

 The easiest and quickest way to do this would be in a food processor fitted with metal blades. If you don't have a food processor, simply place the cookies into a plastic, resealable bag, and whack them with a rolling pin. When you are done, there should be no large chunks left.   If you can't find Oreo cookies, try another type of chocolate sandwich cookie.; , You can melt the butter in a dish in the microwave, or in a small saucepan on the stove.  Keep stirring until the butter and cookies are evenly mixed together. You can use a spoon or a rubber spatula to do this.  The pie pan can be made out of metal or glass. Most bakers find that glass pie pans heat more evenly than metal ones.  You can do this using your hands, the back of a spoon, or a rubber spatula. Make sure to press down firmly, or the crust won't hold together very well.   If you don't want to get your hands dirty, cover the crust mixture with plastic wrap first.  During this time, the melted butter will harden, an make your crust more solid.  

crush 22 oreo cookies into a fine crumble.  melt ¼ cup (55 grams) of butter, and let it cool enough to handle.  combine the melted butter and crushed cookies in a bowl.  place the mixture into a 9 inch (22.86 centimeters) wide pie pan.  spread the mixture across the bottom and sides of the pan.  place the pie pan into the fridge, and wait at least 1 hour. 

 Atomic symbols for atoms can be found on the periodic table. These symbols are used to represent each atom in a Lewis dot structure. Be sure not to mix up the symbols, as this would cause confusion.For example, if you are looking at a water molecule, you would write out O, H, and H.; , The central atom is the atom that all (or at least most) of the other atoms is bonded to. Those atoms may or may not be bonded to each other as well. As a rule of thumb, central atoms are usually atoms with low electronegativity.The water molecule breaks this general trend since the oxygen atom (the most electronegative atom in the molecule) is the center atom. Carbon dioxide is an example of a molecule that follows the trend of center atoms being less electronegative.  Use the octet rule to determine the number and type of bonds present. Each atom’svalence shell should contain eight electrons for the molecule to be stable. Some atoms may be double or triple bonded to achieve this.You should add a single bond from the oxygen to both hydrogens. The hydrogens are not bonded to each other.  While most electrons are used in bonding, some atoms have a set of non bonding electrons. These electrons should also be included in the Lewis structure, as they are very important when determining polarity. Represent all electrons (bonded and unbonded) with dots around their respective atoms.Oxygen has two lone pair electrons. This means they are not used for bonding, but stay attached to the oxygen.  A dipole exists when electrons are unevenly distributed from one side of the molecule to the other. If this is present, then the molecule is polar. If the distribution looks even, the molecule is nonpolar.Since electrons are more attracted to oxygen than hydrogen, they tend to congregate on that end of the molecule. That gives the oxygen a negative charge and the hydrogens a positive charge, creating a dipole. Thus, water is polar.

 Laser hair removal is a cosmetic surgery that beams concentrated light into the hair follicles. When the light is absorbed, the follicle dies.This method is effective for most areas of the body, especially the face, legs, and arms.   Laser hair removal is a medical procedure. Before getting the procedure, carefully select a doctor or technician who you trust. Do not pluck or wax hairs in the area that will undergo laser hair removal for a month or two before the procedure. Laser hair removal targets hair follicles, and the hair is pulled out by the root in both waxing and plucking. Laser hair removal takes up to 9 months to complete, and the procedure can be expensive. However, laser removal is a permanent solution for getting rid of hair. This can save you money on waxings, shaving cream, or depilatory creams in the long run.  Salons offer wax treatments for just about every area of your body. If you are waxing hard to reach places, or you are sensitive to pain, go to a salon and let a professional do it.   Waxing specialists can shape hair, like the eyebrows and bikini area, and also treat your skin with moisturizers before and after to help reduce redness. Getting a professional wax may be the best option for your bikini area. The skin in that region is extremely sensitive and prone to irritation and infection. Plus, it's difficult to see. Many salons offer bikini area waxes for both women and men.  During electrolysis, the hair is destroyed with chemicals or heat. A probe is inserted into the follicle, and then the hair is removed with tweezers.Electrolysis can be used on most areas of the body. The number of treatments needed will vary from person to person. Most people have one treatment every week or two until the treatment period is complete. 

invest in laser hair removal.  go to a salon.  consider electrolysis. 

 There are twelve major scales that you can practice, which will help strengthen the foundation of your piano skills. Becoming familiar with the scales' notations will help you be able to play them accurately. You can search them on the Internet and print them out to use as a reference as you play. A good scale to start with would be the C Major scale, which consists of the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C.   Remember to not miss any sharps or flats. Although the C Major scale has neither sharps nor flats, other scales have them. An example would be the G Major scale, which contains the notes G, A, B, C, D, E, F#, G.  Keep in mind that a sharp is a semitone above and a flat is a semitone below.  ; , The height and distance from the piano should feel comfortable. When sitting on it, you should only take up about half of the seat. Position yourself so that you are close enough to reach the keys but not near enough that your elbows bend. Make sure that your feet can reach the pedals and press down on them when necessary.  Developing a good posture helps you play naturally. Your body will be relaxed enough to avoid strain, and you'll be able to play for long periods of time without growing weary. When you play the piano, keep your back straight, and make sure your head is held high and facing forward. Your shoulders should be relaxed so that you can play naturally. You should also keep your arms and wrists lifted above the keys. Place your legs so that your knees are at a 90 to a 120-degree angle, and position your feet so that they are resting on or in front of the pedals.  In order to play well, you should keep your hands arched and fingers curled on the keys, as if you're holding a baseball. This reduces the chances of cramping or weariness during your practice sessions. You should also keep a straight wrist as this prevents arthritis and carpal tunnel. In the beginning, you can tape a pencil to your wrist to keep it from bending. The goal is to move your fingers, not your wrist.   If your wrists are still bending, sit a little further away from the piano. Keep your nails cut short. This stops them from clicking against the keys, and you'll be able to play better. You want your fingertips to touch the keys, not your nails.  In order to make sure that you properly learn them, start to slow and gradually increase the speed. You will be able to hear each note better and give yourself time to memorize the scale. Playing quickly will only cause the scales to sound sloppy. If you want, you can invest in a metronome, which will teach you to keep the tempo. When you first begin, set the count to 85 beats per minute. Work your way up by increasing the speed.   You can set the count slower if you're having difficulties.  There are specific orders to follow in scales. Using the correct fingering will help you play the scales in the most natural and effective manner possible. In the future, you'll also be able to play other songs with flowing movement. You can look up the fingerings of different scales online and print them out if necessary. When playing, be sure to bend your fingers at their joint and hold up your wrist.  When you first learn the scales, practice them using one hand before moving onto the next. Then, you can play them together. If you notice that your right hand is better than your left, practice more often with your left hand to ensure that you sharpen its skills (and vice-versa). Make sure that you practice with both hands; otherwise, one might lose its skills, and you'll have to train it again.  Repetition is key, as it helps drive the scale into your memory. Be sure to play until it sounds accurate, not sloppy. Do your best to connect all the notes for a smooth sound - never use staccato notes. As you become more familiar with the scale and keys, begin to look straight ahead as you play. You may be tempted to look down at your hands to make sure that you're hitting the right notes. However, the less you watch your fingers, the more secure you become in your playing.  Once you become familiar with one scale, move onto others to continue expanding your skills. Some may take a longer time to learn, as they might contain more flats and sharps than others. However, continue persevering. Don't hesitate to ask for help or look up tutorials and advice on the Internet. Continue practicing old scales to ensure that you don't forget them.  

learn the major scales' notations.  adjust the bench.  sit properly at the piano.  correctly position your hand.  slowly play the scale.  use the correct fingering.  play with one hand at a time.  practice.  broaden your practice sessions to other scales. 

 Personality, in psychological terms, describes individual characteristics that are unique to one person. These include ways of thinking, feeling and behaving.These combine to determine how the person responds to certain situations.Some examples of personality traits include: honest, moody, outgoing, friendly, or impulsive.; , There are many different theories to explain how personalities develop and why some people have certain characteristics and not others.Many of these theories are based on beliefs that personality is biologically or environmentally based (the "nature versus nurture" theory).Once a personality develops, the traits are usually stable across time.Allport's trait theory argues that personality traits are biologically determined, but formed by environmental experience.Eysenck's personality theory believes that personality can be understood by looking at a few dimensions of a person's entire behavior., Realize that all parts of your personality have value. Sometimes it can be difficult to recognize subtle personality traits, since strong characteristics are dominant. These subtle traits, such as predictability, generosity, and sympathy,are just as important as the prominent ones.   Don't forget that more subdued personality traits are very strong in certain situations or roles. For example, empathy and conscientiousness are vital during major life events, like weddings or funerals.  Realize that not everyone has a unique assortment of personality traits. Appreciating the differences in personality traits between people can benefit you when you are working on a team or are a manager. Valuing more subtle, but strong traits like empathy and generosity can help strengthen relationships and make working as a team easier.The most effective leaders and managers are able to appreciate, enhance, and effectively use different personality types.For example, if you notice that someone on your team is soft spoken, but very informed on a subject, have that person create detailed project materials or programs. This will put the person's skills to use without causing the person anxiety.  Assertiveness is the ability to express your opinions or stand up for your own needs tactfully, without aggression or defensiveness. It's often seen as the opposite of passivity or shyness. There are a few different aspects to being assertive that include the ability to:Request things from others (like favors), delegate, ask for help, and express needs or wants. Express negative emotions such as disagreement, complaints, the desire to be alone, and to refuse the requests of others. Show positive emotions such as pride or attraction and give compliments to others. Question authority and tradition by asking why with respect. This demonstrates your investment to make change happen and shows you share control in decision making. Start, continue, and stop conversations with others confidently, as well as the ability to change the topic of conversations and share opinions or experiences. Productively deal with daily irritations before they become reasons for anger.  You may want to be more assertive at work. Or, maybe you want to become more assertive at home.Spend some time considering which parts of your life would benefit from you standing up for yourself. It may help to think about what you're struggling with right now.   For instance, maybe you'd like to be able to tell your boss that you're overloaded and want to delegate tasks to another team member. For example, if your partner repeatedly does something that bothers you, you might want the ability to express that frustration tactfully.  Describe the situation or issue, while being as specific as possible about how you see things. Take care not to use "you" statements. These can sound accusatory and aren't usually taken well. Use "I" statements instead.Express your opinion firmly while maintaining eye contact and composure. Clearly and specifically describe how you'd like the situation to change.   For example, if a friend repeatedly cancels plans with you, you might say, "When you cancel plans, I feel frustrated and hurt. In the future, please only make plans you intend on keeping or give me extra notice."Be reasonable with your requests and consider the other person’s needs or restraints. Be open to feedback and be willing to make changes as needed.  Role-playing is an exercise where you ask someone to play the person you'll actually be speaking with. This gives you a great chance to practice having a strong personality before you actually interact with the person. Practice by assertively saying everything you're planning on expressing to the person.This will help you work through rough points in the conversation and can boost your confidence for the actual talk. Role-playing is just as beneficial for you as it is for the person you'll eventually be speaking with. It can give you insight as to your communication style and lets you change the conversation based on what's working and what isn't., Leadership is the ability to direct, motivate, or inspire others to challenge themselves or accomplish goals.This may seem completely natural for some people, but you can also learn and develop this skill. Leadership doesn't simply mean leading a large group of people. You can use this skill to positively influence others in your peer group, such as moving conversations to positive or more interesting topics.   It can also help you gain the trust of work colleagues or supervisors.For example, you might find that normally you sit back and listen to conversations. But, you may find yourself in a group where no one is really talking. Leadership might be as simple as getting the group to talk about something, whether it's politics or a new tv show.  There's no set way to become a leader. Instead, develop a variety of skills that create a sense of leadership. You might try volunteering to coach a little league team, participate on a planning committee at work, sign up for special leadership projects at your office, or find a mentor who is experienced at leading and influencing others.Use these activities to develop the following skills:Motivating others and giving direction Being comfortable with taking on responsibility and accepting responsibility for mistakes if they happen Taking the initiative to make a change Organizing others, such as in events or gatherings Learning from frustration or failure Excellent listening skills to hear the opinions and needs of the group Flexibility to change the plan if needed  , Resilience is the ability to endure stress and the ability to adapt to changes.For example, you might be resilient if you find out you have chronic disease, but are able to keep an optimistic attitude and inspire those around you. It may seem like resilience comes naturally to some people, but you can actually learn it to become more resilient.If you're resilient, you're might be able to:Create and continue with realistic plans Be confident in your abilities Communicate effectively and solve problems Manage powerful emotions and impulses  , Even the most resilient person may struggle to deal with stressful situations. Having strong relationships can help you build your resistance to difficult times. Seek relationships with friends, family, or your community. These relationships can create a strong support network that can boost your resilience., People that don't have strong resilient personalities might have a hard time finding solutions to difficult situations. If this sounds like you, you may feel like the situation will last forever and that there's nothing you can do. Strengthen your personality by learning to trust yourself. Recognize that you may not be able to change your circumstance, but you can change how you interpret it.For example, if you're struggling with a tough training period after starting a new job, remind yourself that training will end and you'll be prepared to work in your new job setting. The training period is temporary.  If you feel like you're stuck and that your life is just the same routine, do something to make a change, especially when you're going through a hard time. It is tempting to disengage and stew when things get hard. But, it is important to work through any problems by taking action where you can. The feeling of moving forward will help you bounce back and feel like you're in control of the situation.For example, maybe you've been told that you'll never become a professional athlete. You could keep trying, against the odds, or put your energy towards a new hobby. Don't simply give up and give in.

          Put a large pot of water on the stove to boil and add 1/2 tbsp. (8 ml) of salt to the pot. You'll need about 6 quarts (5.5 L) of water to cook 1 lb. (0.45 kg) of angel hair pasta. Once the water has come to a boil add the angel hair pasta and stir. Begin timing the angel hair pasta once the water boils, and turn the heat down so the water simmers. You want to cook the pasta in simmering water for about 3 minutes or slightly longer if you like a softer pasta. Drain the pasta and either chill it under cold running water or toss it with a sauce and serve it immediately.; ,          A classic way of preparing angel hair pasta is with garlic and olive oil. For 1 lb. (0.45 kg) of pasta you'll need 3 tbsp. (45 ml) of good quality olive oil. Pour the olive oil into a skillet and crush 2 cloves of garlic.

 If you've looked across the room in English class and have caught her staring at you, then she may like you. If she abruptly looks away, blushes, or doesn't look in your direction for the rest of the class, that makes it even more likely that she likes you because she feels like she's been caught. You can also see if you catch her eye in group hang-outs. Look her way from across the room at a party and see if she's staring at you.   If she's the type who just stares off and daydreams a lot, then she may not be directing her attention towards you.  If you talk to her and find her giggling for no good reason, or even outright laughing even when you haven't said anything funny, then this may be because she likes you. Laughter is a natural way to shed some nervous energy, so the girl is probably laughing or giggling because she's nervous or excited to be around you.   See if she laughs around everyone, or if you have a special effect on her funny bone.  If the girl passes you in the halls with her friends, and her friends are laughing and nudging her when you come by, this is a sign that they all know that she likes you and are teasing her. If she says "Stop!" or gently shoves her friends or refuses to make eye contact with you when this happens, then this makes it even more likely that she's into you.   If a girl in middle school has a crush on you, it's almost guaranteed that her friends will know. Watch her friends carefully for any signs that they know how she feels about you.  She'll most likely touch you in a teasing way like a playful shove, or tap you on the shoulder to tell you something. Still, this is her way of flirting and trying to get close to you. Notice if she touches all the guys around her or only you. If she only pays special attention you, then it's a sign that she likes you.   If she touches all the guys around her playfully, then she may just be a physical person.  If she gives you a bowl she made in ceramics class, or if she even went to the mall and got you something silly like a pencil with your favorite sports team's logo on it, then she's telling you that she likes you. If she brings candy or cookies to school and makes a point of offering you some, then she's trying to impress you and telling you that she likes you.  

see if you can catch her staring at you.  see if she easily giggles around you.  see if she's always laughing with her friends when they pass you.  see if she tries to gently touch you.  see if she gives you a small gift. 

 A well-written letter will have a greeting, a body paragraph (or paragraphs), and a closing.   Your greeting (or salutation) should start with the words, “Dear .” It should always go at the top of the page. After the greeting, you will develop the body of the letter. The body is the main text where you communicate at length with your pen pal. Finally, you will sum up or conclude your thoughts in a closing. The closing usually consists of a final paragraph and a signatory phrase like “Sincerely,” followed by your signature.; , This is the meat of the letter where you introduce yourself, ask lots of interested questions, and share your thoughts. The body of your letter might be two to five paragraphs depending on paragraph length.   In your first letter, you should introduce yourself in a general way. Offer info about your home life, hobbies, and interests. Even obvious things that your pen pal probably already knows can be included in your introductory letter. For instance, you might introduce yourself by writing, “I am twelve years old. I live with my father and two sisters. I am in sixth grade and my favorite subject is history. In my spare time I enjoy reading and playing X-Box.” Don’t write everything about your life all at once.You'll have plenty of time to share things with your pen pal as you grow closer. Be specific. For instance, don’t say that you like film, crafts, and exercise. Instead, say that you enjoy Marvel movies, knitting and needlework, and riding your bike. As you get to know your pen pal better, you will be better equipped to respond to his or her perspectives, sense of humor, and ideas in the body of your letter. You will also feel more comfortable expressing yourself and confiding in your pen pal. The more you write to your pen pal, the easier it will be to know what topics are of interest to both of you.  If writing to a pen pal in prison, do not include self-incriminating information. Prison mail is screened carefully and you might get in trouble when prison staff discovers your secrets.If you are an undocumented immigrant, do not include this fact in your letters -- you never know who your pen pal is sharing their correspondence with. Information about your income or wages should also remain confidential.   Do not share too much too soon. You may want to rent a PO box if you don’t feel comfortable with a stranger knowing where you live.  Ask questions about your pen pal’s work, hobbies, and family. Invite your pen pal to share their feelings on a variety of common interests. Develop a genuine curiosity about your pen pal and don’t be shy when writing.   For instance, if your pen pal mentions he or she does track and field, ask how fast they can run, if they’ve ever participated in a relay race, and what the furthest distance they’ve ever run is.  While you will have lots of questions about your pen pal and his/her life, you need to stay cognizant of their boundaries. If you’re writing to a pen pal overseas, they might assume a different level of familiarity and comfort with you than you do with them. It may be awkward for them to talk candidly about certain topics. If you sense some reticence on the part of you pen pal, avoid snooping into their habits and life. If your pen pal doesn’t answer certain questions, don’t ask them again and assume the topic is sensitive.   Alternately, if your pen pal is more direct and insists on certain boundaries, respect them. For instance, if your pen pal does not want to talk about their sexuality or family life, do not insist they do so.Similarly, do not feel obligated to confess everything about yourself if you are not comfortable doing so. If your pen pal tries to engage you on a certain topic or issue you do not want to talk about, don’t feel as if you have to open up to them. Let your pen pal know in a direct way if there are any topics which you do not want to talk about. Like any other friend, your pen pal should be respectful of your boundaries and mindful of your feelings.  The final part of your letter is the closing. Pen a final paragraph saying goodbye to your pen pal and leave him or her with something to think over or answer. For instance, you might close with a few brief sentences which conclude the main idea you’ve traced through the letter.For example, if your letter was mainly about how excited you are for summer, you might write, “With luck, the weather will clear up here soon. I really want to start swimming again. How about you? Do you like swimming, too? Or are there other summer sports you’re interested in? Hope to hear from you soon.” Skip two lines and write “Sincerely,” “Take it easy,” or “Until next time,” with your signature on the line just below the final word you write.  The envelope should include both a return address (your address) and the receiver’s address. Write your address in the upper left corner of the envelope. Write your name first, then your street address below that, and then on a third line, write your city, state, and zip code. Follow the same format for the receiver’s address, but put it in the center of the envelope.   Don’t forget to add postage. It’s a good idea to take your letter to the post office the first time you send it out so that you know which stamps you need to mail it, especially if your pen pal is in a foreign country. If your pen pal resides within the US, you could use forever stamps, which cover the cost of mailing a letter no matter how the price of postage to or from a particular place fluctuates. Drop your letter in the mailbox or bring it to the post office for delivery.  Your pen pal, like you, is a busy person. Don’t expect a reply overnight. Wait at least two weeks for a reply. If your pen pal doesn’t write back within two weeks, send them another letter or -- assuming you have their email address -- an email.Many people are used to instantaneous communication via email, texting, and phones, and consider letter-writing a waste of time. However, one of the virtues of writing letters is that it does take time and thus requires (and instills) patience.  If you only want to write twice a month, let your pen pal know. Conversely, if you can write every week, or multiple times each week, tell your pen pal. There are no obligations regarding how often you should write, but whatever you decide, let your pen pal know up front so that they don’t expect more from you.Conversely, if you want a more committed pen pal but have not found one, keep looking. Do not feel that you need to limit yourself to just one pen pal at a time.  Lots of little things make great gifts for your pen pal. If your pen pal lives in another country, they might be interested in coins from your native country. You could also include recent articles you think your pen pal might find of interest, and reference them in the text of your letter. If you are very close to your pen pal and feel comfortable, you could send a photo of yourself doing a fun activity.If writing to a pen pal in prison, ask if they can receive certain items before sending them.Each prison sets its own guidelines regarding what is and is not allowed in personal correspondence. Decorate your letter. If you’re artistic, include little drawings or sketches to illustrate your text. Include stickers to add a personal touch.  If, for instance, your pen pal comments that they started a new job, ask them in your reply how they like it, if their coworkers are kind, and so on. Take an interest in what they are going through.If your pen pal has questions, answer them. If there are any questions you don’t want to answer, tell your pen pal directly. Ask for photos of your pen pal’s pets, collections, and art.  Let the conversation between you and your pen pal develop naturally.   Reference major events in your life, like attending a movie, concert, or play; having a good or bad dining experience; getting an award at school; or learning a new skill like cooking. Don’t reduce yourself to a mere reporter; instead, offer a thoughtful analysis of some of the recent developments in your life. For instance, instead of flatly stating, “I saw the new Captain America movie yesterday,” and leaving it at that, say, “I saw the new Captain America movie. I loved all the characters that were included from the many other Marvel films. The cinematography and acting were, in my view, the best in the series. You should check it out!”  , In your letters, comment upon things that your pen pal might also have experience with or opinions about, such as news stories or your work life. For instance, you could write, “I am really excited about Candidate X. I donated to her campaign and volunteered to go door-to-door on her behalf. How about you? Do you plan on voting?”  , Use social media like Facebook and Tumblr to connect more deeply with your pen pal. Staying in touch this way ensures your friendship blossoms during the interim between getting each other’s letters.Don’t let social media or digital communication replace your letter-writing relationship. While modern forms of communication are important, they offer no substitute for the joy which letter-writing provides.  Are you doing research on a certain topic? Practicing a foreign language? Learning more about life and culture in another land? Depending on your interests and purpose in writing to a pen pal, you will make different choices about who you opt to connect with.For instance, if you are interested in learning German, you should connect with a pen pal from Germany, Austria, or a German speaker in another country. If you are interested in learning more about Japan, you should identify pen pals in Japan who can share their insights into Japanese society.  If you’re interested in simply making a friend, it might be beneficial to write to someone with whom you share some common ground. Try to write to someone who is about your age and has similar interests.   For instance, if you are a 17-year-old punk rocker, you will be unlikely to gain much from your exchange with a 45-year-old businessman. Try to locate pen pals who you think are interesting and who you can really look forward to writing to. Many pen pal clubs exist which cater to specific subsets of the population. For instance, there are certain pen pal clubs which cater only to teen and tween girls; others are exclusively for students.Of course, you don’t have to find a clone of yourself to have a great pen pal. Sometimes we learn more about ourselves and the world we live in by interacting with people who are very different from us., Pen Pal World, Penpals Now, and Letter Writers Alliance are just some of the many sites which facilitate letter writing connections.   Some pen pal connection services require payment, while some are free. Both can provide good pen pals, but check what kind of service you’re enrolling with before you get too excited about the sign-up process.  

choose an appropriate format for your letter.while there are no hard rules regarding how to structure your letters, many people choose to employ a three-part format.  write the body of your letter.  be cautious about what you share.  ask lots of questions.show an interest in your pen pal’s life.  don’t be invasive.  close your letter.  address your envelope.  be patient when waiting for a reply.  decide how committed you are to your pen pal.  include a little present or gift.  comment on what your pen pal writes.  don’t treat your pen pal letters like a diary.growing closer to your pen pal requires including personal feelings and experiences, but you should not offer a blow-by-blow account of your every waking hour since your last letter.  connect with your pen pal over common experiences.  talk to your pen pal online.  consider why you want to write to a pen pal.  think about your own interests and background.  use the web to find a pen pal.there are many forums and websites available which connect people to pen pals both at home and abroad. 

 Pry the Caps Lock key from the keyboard. This will leave a hole where the key used to be, but you don't need administrator privileges to do this.  

physically remove the key. 

 You can reduce shoplifting by attaching tags to articles which only clerks can remove when a customer pays for the article. If someone tries to leave the store with the tag still attached, an alarm will sound.Go into any retail store to see how the system works. If you’re interested in installing a system for your store, then talk with the manager to ask who they contract with for their system.  Security guards are a common presence in banks and other money handling businesses. The guard is usually stationed in the lobby so that customers can see them. The guard can handle disruptive customers. However, their presence alone can scare off potential robbers.   You don’t need to hire your own security guard. Instead, you can contract with a security agency, which will send a guard out to your business. You can find security agencies by looking in your phone book or by searching online.  You can also prevent crime by putting up screens or partitions that separate your employee from the public. Install bullet-proof glass as a barrier.These partitions are common in banks and in convenience stores. However, some customers might be scared off from your business if you have clerks hidden behind bullet-proof Plexiglas, so assess whether partitions are right for your business.  A common crime is for someone to return an item they didn’t buy from you and ask for a refund. To prevent this crime, request proof of purchase such as the original sales receipt.   Put up signs around your store warning customers they can’t return an item without a receipt. You also might want to prohibit returns entirely.  

use electronic article surveillance.  hire a security guard.  install screens for employees handling money.  require proof of purchase before issuing refunds. 

; , Try to catch the ball after one hop.  You can maintain the bouncing by slightly pulling up on the clubface while the ball is falling down on it. There is definitely a timing element similar to the old paddle game, so don't practice this anywhere near your golf course or buddies unless you want a new nickname.  The clubface should point directly to the sky so a glass of water could rest on it. By selecting a club with any angle that is 56°(sand wedge) and above, you will have the largest, flattest clubface in the bag. If you use a driver or other "wood," you can bounce the ball on different sides of the clubface to see the gear effect of spin on a clubface that has bulge and roll.  This is accomplished by cradling the ball back on the face by reducing the hit on the ball. Angling the clubface and missing the sweet spot can also reduce the bounce. Once the ball begins to stop bouncing, keep the face under the ball and let it settle on the clubface.  Practice this first without any bouncing. When you can reduce the bounce, the stopping will become easier. Getting the ball to stop is like the marble in the maze game. You have to keep tilting the clubface to keep the ball level and centered. Once it stops, just jumpstart it again.  

grip the club with your dominant hand on the shaft near the hosel (the part of the club that connects the head with the shaft) with the clubface facing skyward.  hold the ball a few inches over the clubface and drop the ball on the face.  on the next try, let the ball bounce more than once, keeping the clubface directly under the ball.  after you develop more than a few bounces, move your hand further up the shaft to the grip end like tiger.  learn to stop the ball on the face.  try to get the ball to rest on one dimple. 

 When visiting your potential pet, take stock of the area where he is being housed. Whether you're going through a rescue or breeder, you want to make sure conditions are clean. A dog or puppy kept in unsanitary conditions may be at risk for health problems.   The area should be relatively clean. If you're looking at a litter of young puppies, it's understandable if there are a few stray droppings. Puppies are not born house trained and the accidents may have just occurred. However, if the floor is covered in droppings, dirt, and other debris, this is not a clean environment.The poodle or poodles should be clean as well. Their fur should not be covered in food or droppings. Their coats should be clean and un-matted. They should also look relatively healthy. Poodles, puppies especially, should not have a bony appearance.However, there is one exception — if you're going through a rescue and a dog has just come in, he may still show some signs of neglect such as an emaciated appearance. If animals are being kept in poor conditions, this is a bad sign. If not cared for properly, dogs can develop health conditions, like fleas or ringworm, as well as behavioral problems. You also do not want to give your money to an establishment that is abusing their animals.; , If you decide to go through a breeder, ask to see any certificates they have about screening tests they put the parents through. Not all breeders do this, in which case you are in the dark about the potential of the parents to pass down genetic disease. If you have an option, patronize a breeder who goes to the trouble of running these tests and can prove their breeding stock is health. Poodles are a generally healthy breed, but you want to know your puppy's family history to spot any health problems that may occur down the road.Hip dysplasia, joint problems, and eye problems like cataracts are common in toy poodles. Chronic conditions, like autoimmune disorders and seizure disorders, may also occur in poodles. If these problems run in a puppy's family, it does not necessarily mean she will inherit them herself. However, it does increase her risk.If you see any health problems listed on your poodle's history, do some research. If your poodle were to develop this condition, consider whether you could handle this. Health problems vary greatly in terms of care. Some conditions, like Addison's Disease, may require long-term treatment that can get costly. Others, like cataracts, can be cleared up with a simple (but expensive) surgery. Poodles have a reputation for being healthy but are subject to a number of conditions which can impact on their life, even in young or middle age, such as luxating patellas or eyesight problems. If you're working with a quality breeder, he will make an effort to breed out serious conditions., If you're going through a rescue, you'll want to learn about special concerns. Many dogs placed in a rescue or shelter were abandoned or abused in previous homes. This can lead to behavioral or health problems. Review a dog's history in detail before selecting a rescue poodle.   Abuse and neglect are unfortunately common aspects of many rescue dogs' histories. If your poodle has been abused, he may have behavioral problems. He might be skittish or difficult to leave alone. Neglect can also cause health problems. If a dog has been beaten or physically abused, he may have problems with chronic pain.This doesn't mean you shouldn't adopt a dog who has been abused — just be sure you understand that he'll need lots of patience, special attention, love, and training. Some poodles are abandoned because they have existing health problems. Previous owners may have been unwilling or unable to accommodate the dog's needs. Make sure you ask rescue workers about a dog's health. Know what medications he needs, how much treatment costs, and any other special concerns.  Unless you're adopting a very elderly poodle, toy poodles are a generally high-energy breed. Make sure any poodle you purchase is eager and playful.If you're going through a breeder, you may notice a couple of poodles from a litter seem high-energy while the others seem a bit sluggish. This is a bad sign. This could mean an illness or infection is going around in the litter. Even if your poodle is not currently sick, she's very likely to get sick later on. Be wary in these situations., Adopting a dog is a big responsibility. You should visit any poodle you're considering several times before making a decision.   Ideally, you should interact with the dog both one-on-one and observe him with other animals. You want a pet that's affectionate and unafraid of people. You also want to make sure your potential dog gets along with other animals. It can be difficult to have a pet that's aggressive or overly skittish in the presence of other dogs. If you're going through a rescue, it may not be possible to observe your poodle with other dogs. If a dog has known behavioral problems, he may have to be separated from other animals at all times., Once you decide on a poodle, take her to the vet within 48 hours of adoption. You want to have a full exam conducted. You should also bring in a stool sample to check for parasites. If something negative comes up in the exam, you can return the poodle. Most breeders and rescues allow you to change your mind about adopting a dog without penalty within a certain timeframe. 

observe the area where the animals are kept.  speak with the breeder about the health of the parents.  learn about any special concerns when going through a rescue.  look for alert, perky, and responsive animals.  visit a poodle several times before making a final decision.  take your dog or puppy to the vet within 48 hours. 

 This is is the best way to bring others onto your side and ready them for active participation during the event.; , Before entering the room be well dressed and have an energetic look. This will bring a positive atmosphere into the room. If you are shabbily dressed and wear a gloomy face, it affects the participants' mood. So always give a smile to the participants and have a fresh look.  Give a brief introduction about yourself. This will help the students to get to know you.  Have a little session of introduction about the expectations from the session, what the participants can expect to learn and how they will achieve expected outcomes. Explaining this will help in developing a certain bond between you and the participants. It will also allow them to ask questions of you without any hesitation.  After few topics, try to give a break or interval to ensure freshness. In the middle of the session, give a few real life examples which will divert the concentration of your students, especially if they are in some sleepy mood. Try some good examples which will draw their attention back to the topic which you were explaining to them.  This helps them to stay participatory and to reflect on what they're hearing and learning. After the completion of any section or topic, try to ask few questions. This ensures a parallel participation between the participants, the trainer and the session will go in a smooth manner.  At the end of the session, ask for their opinion regarding the session. Having a friendly talk will help to find out whether they need any help on that particular topic and let them know that they can contact the trainer if needed. Share some appropriate jokes and leave the place with a laughter in the room of the participants and a smile and satisfaction on the trainer's face.  

start with a smile.  present yourself well.  introduce yourself and get a brief introduction from the participants.  explain the session in a very clear way.  give sufficient breaks.  ask questions of the students.  try to get feedback and suggestions at the end of the session.

 You might feel really bowled over and worried but remember it has been accomplished by women for as long as women have been having children. From the times with no proper medical care or knowledge for pregnant women, to third world countries and women having babies in the middle of their workplace, some women have been having a second set of twins all around the world. Times have changed thank goodness, and medical care has evolved. Your first step after you have confirmed with your doctor that it is twins is to take a day to let it all sink in before you tell the world.; , This isn't something that everybody gets to do once, let alone twice! Most likely you have kept a lot of baby stuff you can reuse. If not, don't run out and spend your money on a whole bunch of stuff. People are going to feel sorry for you in the sense of the expense of buying everything all over again. You will more than likely get lots of gifts!  , This news is going to travel fast!   Decide when you wish to tell family. Many women wait for three months to ensure that the babies are healthy, and if you have any history of particular issues, even longer can be appropriate. However, you will need to balance this with how soon you're likely to show.  Well deserved attention, as you are caring for an two extra lives inside you and you've already had twins, so people will be super curious.  Your doctor will advise you of an appropriate meeting regime. With this pregnancy, if you have any odd pains or weird feelings, get checked out right away. Your poor uterus was stretched to maximum capacity the first time around. Now it is going to go through this again and you want to be careful that no problems will arise.  Get some exercise, such as light walking but never overdue it. The last thing you want is to be on bed rest! Pay attention to your body. If something hurts unusually or just doesn't feel right, get it checked out.  You will need to rest often, to preserve your energy and to be ready for giving birth when it's close to time. Ask family and friends if they can babysit a few times a week, to give you a good break.   Now is a good time to also ask who is prepared to help after the birth; after all, double sets of twins means a lot more than double the work. You need all the help you can get.  Be realistic about the options and let everyone caring for you know that you have a plan.   If it turns out you have to have C-section this time, or perhaps you had one the first time as well, it's not the end of the world. Remember how busy you were the first time around? Take the help once again––maybe even more so this time! You already are super mom so keep it that way and don't wear yourself out so badly that the whole experience is not enjoyable.  You know exactly what to expect this time around but it's still perfectly okay to feel even more emotional because let's face it, you remember clearly what it was like the first time! It will be somewhat the same the second time, only more exhausting because now two more makes four!   When your two bundles arrive, you will feel extremely emotional and proud. When you get home, this can quickly turn to feeling extremely overwhelmed. If people offer help,take it! Don't let your pride get in the way and think "I can do this all myself". It will be less exhausting for you if you accept help. Your first year will be a blur and by far the most exhausting. Once again, take any help you can get!  , Remember that the tough days turn into a new day and it will be completely different.  

if you're expecting twins and you've already got twins, it's scary and exciting at once.  feel very blessed.  be sure to call family immediately.  be prepared for lots of attention.  try to make all of your checkup sessions.  take extra care of yourself.  get some help with your existing twins.  prepare a birth plan.  be prepared to experience a range of emotions after the birth.  enjoy every moment you can. 

 Mandolines are a staple cutting tool for professionals chefs and at-home meal makers alike and are handy for making lots of uniform cuts quickly. Follow the manufacture’s setup instructions so that your mandoline is standing upright on your cutting board. , This will determine the thickness of your tomato slices.   Depending on the make and model of your mandoline, you can dial-in or adjust your blade's distance from the mandoline's body to make thicker or thinner slices. Make sure your blades are sharp -- this will help you make really thin slices without seizing up the machine or ripping the tomato.  Mandolines almost always come with a hand-guard to hold the object you're planning to cut.   Some models have spikes inside the holder to help secure slippery items like tomatoes. Mandoline blades can be very sharp and can slice neatly into exposed fingertips, so always use the hand-guard to protect yourself!  , The mandoline is going to do most of this for you.   Start at the top of the mandoline body and slide the tomato and hand-guard down and over the blades. Try using a slight zig-zag motion to move over the blades; this will help to cut through the tomato's skin and not squish it. Return to the top and drag down again to create another slice. Keep repeating this step until you reach the end of your tomato.  Your slices will all be same thickness, which is especially great for even cooking times and ensuring everything is cooked.  

set up your mandoline.  set the blade.  load your tomato.  cut your tomato.  enjoy!

 This is a simple way of encoding messages so they can't be understood at a glance. A message like "Meet me outside" written in reverse would instead be "Teem em edistuo."   This code can be easily solved, but it can be useful if you think someone is trying to peek at your message.; , Write out the letters A through M in a single line on a piece of paper. Directly beneath this line, write out the letters N through Z also in a single line. Change each letter of messages to the opposite letter of the two lines of letters you have written out.   By using a reflected alphabet, the message "Hello" would instead become "Uryyb.", Draw a tic tac toe grid on a piece of paper. Write out the letters A through I in the grid going from the left to right, top to bottom. In this example:   The first row is made up of the letters A, B, C. The second is made up of D, E, F. The last row is made up of G, H, I., Draw another tic tac toe grid beside the first one. Fill the grid in with the letters J through R, similarly to the first grid. Then mark dots in each space of the grid of each row as described:   In the first row, starting on the left, place a dot in the lower right corner (letter I), on the bottom middle side (letter K), and in lower left corner (letter L). In the second row, starting on the left, place a dot on the middle right side (letter M), on the bottom middle side (letter N), and on the middle left side (letter O). In the second row, starting on the left, place a dot in the upper right corner (letter P), on the top middle side (letter Q), and in the upper left corner (letter R)., These two X shapes will also be filled with letters to complete your pigpen cipher key. In the second X, place dots in the open spaces surrounding where the X crosses so there is a dot on each side of the center of the X. Then:   In the first (undotted) X shape, write S in the top of the X, T on the left side, U on the right, and V on the bottom. In the second X shape, write W in the top of the X, X on the left side, Y on the right, and Z on the bottom., The grid shapes (including dots) surrounding letters are used as substitutes for the letters themselves. Use your pigpen cipher key to translate messages into and out of pigpen. 

write out words in reverse.  reflect the alphabet in half to encipher messages.  try pigpen cipher.  create a second tic tac toe grid with dots.  write out two x shapes beneath each grid.  use the grid surrounding the letters to write in pigpen cipher. 

 The height of your seat isn't the only thing that matters. Seats can be slid forward and backward and angled up or down to get rid of sore spots and make a more comfortable ride. To test for the perfect fore/aft position of the seat:   While riding, stop your feet so that one pedal is at 3:00 position (completely forward. Your foot should be flat. Imagine a straight line coming down from the front of your knee to the ground. This line should intersect through the middle of your pedal. In other words, your knee should be right over your pedal when in the 3:00 position., On the back of the seat, pointing down at the back wheel, is a small bolt that controls the seat placement. It connects to a bracket that clamps onto small metal tubes that hold the seat in place. Loosen this bolt by turning it counter-clockwise to lower the pressure on the clamps that keep the seat in place.  You should be able to comfortably reach your handlebars, and your knee should be over the pedal when your foot is at 3:00 in the pedal rotation. A good test is to try standing as you ride. If your seat is in the right position, you should be able to stand up easily without pulling or pushing on the handlebars. If you experience any of the following problems, slide the seat forward or back while the bolt is still loose:   Trouble standing, reaching for the bars, and finger numbness can mean the seat is too far back. Trouble feeling comfortable down hills and shoulder pain can mean your seat is too far forward., Use a carpenter's level to make sure the seat is flat -- this evenly distributes your weight for more comfortable riding. That said, if you experience discomfort in your crotch you can adjust the seat a little, though no more than 3 degrees in either direction.          Women should typically tilt the seat slightly down for more comfort. Men should typically tilt the seat slightly up for more comfort., This bolt, usually on the right of the seat, allows you to easily change the angle of the seat and then tighten it in place again. Some older seats have two small bolts underneath the seat, one in front of the seat post and one behind, that are needed to change the seat angle. You must tighten one side to push that side up while loosening the other, almost like a see-saw.         Never make large adjustments to your seat angle. Check you seat height and forward position first, then adjust the angle slightly, if at all.  

know that the angle and forward position of a bike seat will affect your riding comfort.  loosen the bolt underneath the seat to change forward/backward seat position.  make sure the seat is far enough forward for a comfortable ride.  make sure that your seat angle is level with the floor.  loosen the bolts on the side of the seat to change the seat angle. 

 Start by standing, and lean forward until your hands are on the ground and your hips in the air. Imagine your body is a straight line from your hips to your hands; this will help you lengthen your spine. Hold this pose for up to a minute., Lie face down on a stability ball while holding a dumbbell in each hand. Your legs should extend straight behind you, and your feet should be spaced slightly wider than your shoulders. When you start, your arms should be stretched out below your shoulders. Lift the dumbbells up to shoulder height, keeping your arms straight, before lowering them down again.Do two to three sets of ten reps.  Set up a resistance band on a door or sturdy piece of furniture. Holding onto the ends of the band, move back a few feet. With your legs slightly bent and spine straight, start “rowing” with the band by pulling your elbows back behind your waist. Squeeze your shoulder blades, and return to starting position.Do two or three sets of 10-20 reps each, or two or three sets lasting 30-60 seconds. You should continue until you begin to feel a burning sensation in the back of your shoulders and arms. If this exercise is too difficult, you might try sitting on a chair while doing it. The resistance band should be about waist height.  At the gym, find a pull-down machine with a wide bar. Hold the bar with your chest slightly puffed out. As you exhale, pull the bar down until it almost touches your chest. After holding the pose for a second, slowly raise the bar back to starting position, inhaling as you do so.Start out doing one or two sets of 10-15 reps each. As you build strength and get more comfortable with the exercise, you can start gradually increasing your number of sets and/or reps, and adding more weight. Before starting this exercise, adjust the seat to your height, and make sure that the correct weight is chosen.  

stand in a downward facing dog pose.  lift dumbbells in a y-raise.  row with a resistance band.  perform lat pull downs. 

 It is customary to provide written notice of resignation, and if your employer will accept it, you might like to resign via email. You might present your situation using your phone (email), tablet, lap-/desk-top to do email (avoid using a fax, as the print is often not clean -- and although a postal letter should work, as well, that can be very slow).; , If you have a good relationship with your leadership and your resignation might come as a surprise, it may be better to broach the subject in person, less formally, first.  Be ready to provide notice in writing shortly after stating your intent to resign, to make sure there's a record of your notice.   Happy feelings for all depends on your job environment and the terms you're leaving on; if the situation is tense or your work environment is very formal, providing written notice immediately might be beneficial so that you have a paper trail of all communication regarding the resignation.  Just because you're resigning doesn't mean you should air or discuss your grievances about your boss, coworkers, or company. You want to maintain good terms to maintain the lines of communication. You may need references from your employer in the future, and maintaining a network of positive work relationships can be very valuable to your career growth.  There's generally no need for a letterhead on an email, but follow the conventions for regular business emails. State all the necessary and relevant details about your department, designation, work experience, date of leaving and the reason of leaving.   Open the email with a greeting. Try to match the tone normal to your company correspondence, erring a bit more on the formal side; if in doubt, be professional but friendly. Mention clearly that you are intending to resign from your position. You may say something like, "I hereby submit my resignation as effective on July 12, 2015" or "Please accept this email as notice of my resignation. My last day of employment will be July 12, 2016." Optionally, state the reason for your leaving straightforwardly. This isn't the time to air grievances or dive into your family drama, and giving a reason is unnecessary. If you do want to explain why, just let them know, for example, "I have been offered a position elsewhere and decided to take it". Or for instance, "I'm leaving for personal reasons". Clearly note the last date of your job there, that is most agreeable with your employer. Offer, if appropriate, to help with finding or training a replacement. You don't necessarily "owe" your employer that, but you may hold a lot of company knowledge that needs to be transferred to someone new. If you're willing to help with recruitment and knowledge transfer, state that.  End the email on a sincere note:   Thank the employer for the opportunity they provided you in the company. Point out something in particular that you appreciated about your role, the company environment, management or your employer. Explain why you liked that, because sincerely explaining your appreciation about the job can make a lasting, powerful impression. It can reflect well upon your future career, including employment references. Close with,"Kind Regards" or "Wishing you the best," followed by your name or signature. Give it a final read to correct any grammatical or spelling errors.  Try to focus on the positive; you may well have worked there for a considerable amount of time and would have learnt some valuable things there. A good rapport with the office colleagues goes a long way. You may also need their references in the future for your new job.   When you seek jobs after leaving one, you may be asked about your previous work experience, and you want it to be positive, as they may get in touch with your previous employers to talk and learn more about you.  It's customary to give at least two weeks notice before leaving, and in more senior positions, it's often best to give even more. If you must leave without notice be aware of your company's policies. Some employment contracts specify requirements and consequences for failure to give notice, and it may affect the benefits you receive.It will almost certainly have an impact on your relationship with your former boss and coworkers.  

avoid unnecessary stress: resign gracefully and leave things with your old employer on good terms; so, you can move on to your next endeavor without burning bridges.  consider talking to your manager in person, about your intentions.  avoid blindsiding them with an unexpected email.  don't be intimidated, but be polite and professional, above all.  follow business email format.  leave your manager feeling warmly toward you, rather than angry about your resignation, by maintaining a friendly tone.  leave gracefully.  beware of leaving without giving notice. 

 They generally ripen 35 to 45 days after the plant blooms.When the watermelon is ripe, the curly tendril on the vine will dry up and turn brown and the white spot on the bottom of the watermelon will turn yellow. The watermelon will also lose its shine and become dull-looking.; , These are all indications of diseases like bacterial wilt and anthracnose.The seeds could be infected, which means they will produce diseased plants.  Watermelons cross pollinate, so seeds collected from a watermelon that was cross-pollinated with a different cultivar may produce watermelons that do not have the desired characteristics.   While you can use seeds that have been collected from a watermelon that has been purchased from a store or local vendor, there is no way to tell from the watermelon whether or not it has been cross pollinated. So, the watermelons that grow from the seeds may be different from the watermelon you bought., Wash the soil off the watermelon with clean water before cutting it open.   Seeds can be collected when the watermelon is eaten or you can cut the watermelon open and pick the seeds out by hand.  Stir the seeds around with a spoon to wash off the pulp. Let them sit in the water at room temperature for two to three days, stirring them gently once each day., Leave any seeds at the bottom in the container.  This will give the seeds a good rinse.  Spread the seeds out on several layers of paper towel or newspaper and let them dry at room temperature.   Dry them in an area that is slightly warmer than room temperature and has good air circulation, like the top of your refrigerator. Do not expose the seeds to direct sunlight.  A plastic container with a lid that seals, a plastic sandwich or storage bag with a zipper seal or a clean glass jar with a lid that screws down tight will work., Put the container in the refrigerator to keep them cool and dormant.   The seeds can be stored for up to five years.  Do this two to four weeks before the last expected frost.  The soil temperatures should rise above 65 °F (18 °C)., Once the seeds are planted in the garden in the spring, you should expect ripe watermelons in the summer every year. 

collect watermelon seeds from ripe, healthy watermelons.  do not collect seeds from watermelons growing on vines that have wilting, spotted or dying leaves or vines.  use seeds from watermelons that have not been grown in a garden with a different watermelon cultivar.  avoid putting salt on the watermelon if you are going to collect the seeds.  put the watermelon seeds into a glass or plastic container and fill the container with water.  on the third or fourth day, pour out the water and any seeds that are floating at the top.  fill the container with fresh water, swish the seeds around and pour the water out several times.  remove the seeds from the container with a spoon or by pouring them into a colander.  put the clean, dry seeds into an air-tight container.  use a pen or marker to label the container along with the year the seeds were processed.  start watermelon seeds indoors in peat pots.  plant the seedlings in the garden two weeks after the last hard frost.  enjoy ripe watermelons in the summer. 

 Your company may have a new product, but, you need let readers and viewers know why they should care.   Perhaps there's an interesting backstory to how the product was developed. Products make the news when there is a huge demand for them before they hit the market. The media also pays attention to products that are particularly innovative. You have to look for the "hook" that has a newsworthy tie on a national level.; , You can also associate with someone already making news. , Or, consider donating a portion of the profits of the sale of your product for a particular cause.  

consider what tv producers and magazine editors are looking for in news and features stories.  relate your product to a national news story that is already occurring, making it both timely and relevant to magazine editors and tv producers.  create a special event relating to your product that appeals to the masses.  ,  offer a special discount, giveaway or contest along with your product. 

 Foods like fruits that are naturally sweet can help satiate your sweet tooth while balancing natural sugar with necessary nutrients like fiber and antioxidants. Replace processed snack foods high in sugar with whole foods like fruit to help balance your cravings.Dried fruit and 100 percent fruit juices can also help replace refined sugars with natural sugars, but often they have a higher overall sugar content and lack many of the nutrients of a piece of fresh fruit. Be careful of overusing these products.; , Get three to five small meals comprised of whole foods throughout the day, and snack on healthy snacks such as nuts, fruits, veggies, or small portions of cheese or peanut butter. Eating regular, balanced meals will help curb cravings in daily life.   Often, lack of protein or healthy fats can cause sugar cravings. Incorporate some proteins such as lean meats or nuts into your meals, as well as healthy fats like avocado or fatty fish.Remember that these meals should be properly portioned. Look at nutritional guidelines and recommended serving sizes to ensure that you aren’t eating too much or too little.  Indulge in a small amount of sugar when you crave it most. For example, having a small scoop of ice cream right after dinner could actually help curb cravings for the rest of the evening. Have small, regulated amounts of sugar to help keep cravings in check.Make your treat about quality over quantity. Pick something you know you will truly savor and appreciate and have that in a small amount rather than trying to pack in as much low-calorie dessert as you can. This may mean having a small scoop of your favorite ice cream instead of eating a whole pint of a low-calorie but less satisfying health food brand ice cream. A single “fun size” candy bar or an individual square of chocolate are good options when you want to indulge in a small treat.  Sweeteners do nothing to eliminate your desire for sweet tastes nor do they include any additional nutrients to help prevent such cravings from returning. Avoid foods that are sweetened with artificial sweeteners, such as diet sodas, and instead opt for no-sugar-added products.   If you need a sweetener to replace sugar for an activity like baking, try stevia or raw, unrefined sugar., When you look at food labels, don’t just look for sugar or high-fructose corn syrup. Terms like dextrose, corn syrup, fructose, lactose, maltose, xylitol, sorbitol, and many more can also indicate the presence of processed sugars.Consuming added sugar generally only makes sugar cravings worse. Look carefully for sugar by all of its many names in food labels before you eat.  

look for naturally sweet foods.  eat regular, healthy meals.  indulge a little bit.  avoid artificial sweeteners.  look for hidden sugars. 

 If you're having your wedding far away from where most of your attendees live, have your wedding ceremony and reception held at a hotel and ask for discounts when family and friends are staying at the same hotel. Reserve a block of rooms for your guests several months before the wedding for the best rates.   Speak with the appropriate manager when asking for discounts and reserving rooms. Don't be afraid to haggle! Some haggling is acceptable! You just don't need to be rude about it.; , Venues, catering, and florists tend to be cheaper in small towns than in large metropolitan areas. Find an out-of-the-way hamlet nearby that is drivable for attendees but not going to cost as much as your actual city.  Consider getting married during an off season, such as Lent, September through November, or April. You will be able to negotiate rental prices with reception halls due to decreased demand and business. For instance, if you marry during Lent, you may be able to negotiate a bigger reception hall for the same price as a smaller one.   Also, off season weddings allow for more flexibility because on the off chance you have a 95% return rate on your wedding invites, you will be able to scramble for a bigger room, cake, or food order more easily and often at less cost than during the summer months.  Fridays are also popular wedding days but may cost a lot less than a Saturday event. For even greater savings, choose a weekday evening for your wedding. Schedule the wedding to allow guests time to arrive at the ceremony after the work day has ended.   Many guests enjoy weekday weddings as this frees up their weekends for other activities. Choose a date between November and April (between May and October if you live in the southern hemisphere) to avoid higher peak season rates in many areas.  Consider having your wedding during the day, such as a weekend brunch or a luncheon on Saturday or Sunday. The cost for the venue will be much lower and the daytime lighting is better for color photography.  This can save several hundred dollars which your minister may charge. See information on Becoming Ordained to set up your choice of an officiant.  Cut out the travel (and limo fees) between the chapel and reception hall by having the wedding on the same location as your reception! Also, you may be able to negotiate a cheaper price for using more than one service provided at a particular location. This also makes it easier for out of town guests, since they won't have to drive to two locations. They will appreciate it greatly!   Many churches have halls that are equipped to handle wedding receptions at reasonable fees - especially if you are a member.  Musicians will charge more if asked to perform beyond the time stated in their contract. You will also incur additional limo charges if your event runs longer than planned. Give yourself a certain amount of extra time, to allow for things to go wrong, and then stick to that schedule.   You might find it useful to assign someone the task of keeping track of the schedule and making sure everything stays on time.  If you don't know any musicians yourself, call local college music departments rather then browsing the yellow pages. Students will be cheaper than professionals.   Better yet, if you have a close friend that does music stuff well, ask them if they'll offer you a reduced fee as a wedding gift. You should only ask people that you would actually invite to a wedding though.  When planning your ceremony and reception at a hotel or other venue, ask to speak to a manager who is in charge of these services. A manager should be in a position to offer the best rates for the hotel’s services.   Ask the manager to throw in extras. Use hotel house linens instead of renting others. Hotels and catering halls have their own props and centerpieces that they are happy to loan. Always ask for at least 10% off stated rates.  Another way to reduce the costs associated with weddings is to not mention that the item or service is for a wedding. For example, if you are renting a venue for the wedding, indicate the room will be used for a "family gathering."   This approach can also be helpful for wedding cakes. A regular cake is generally priced much lower than an identical cake which has been identified as a wedding cake. If you plan to have a simple flower scheme (like gerbera daisies and green poms) you can avoid a large markup and the need for an appointment by not mentioning the wedding.  Check at the chapel or venue to see if there's another wedding the same day. Sometimes you can split the cost of decorating with the other couple - if you're both willing to choose neutral colors and whoever goes first makes sure no well-intentioned relatives "clear things up".  Instead of flowers and ribbons to decorate the church, try large potted ferns up at the altar with simple candles. They're inexpensive and very elegant. Keep the ferns back from open flames, though! Safety first!  , Doubling up on favors and decorations or decorations and food can save you a ton of money and some set up and cleanup time, making your special day that much less stressful! There are lots of options for doing this. Consider:   Instead of one big wedding cake, put a small cake on each table. The cake is the dessert and the centerpiece! Surround it with fake flowers or candles to complete the look. If you are doing favors, put the pile of favors neatly stacked in the middle of the table. Try decorating with a photo of the couple or a photo of a city the couple visited together, and use that as the centerpiece, surrounded by inexpensive votive candles. Or, get multiple mini-frames and photos instead and give those away as favors!  , Ask a friend with pretty penmanship to address your invitations instead of hiring a calligrapher. This can save a ton of money and look just as nice! Again, just make sure that they'll do an okay job and that you'll pay them either a small fee or take the arrangements as a wedding gift. You don't want them to feel taken advantage of!   You can have a friend do your wedding programs too! Some of the most attractive wedding programs are printed from a home computer and then creatively assembled with colored cardboard, tissue paper, ribbon, etc.  When you are considering the cost of postage check with the Post Office to find out if there is going to be a rate increase. This can blow your budget. In the U.S., buy Forever stamps at the current rate. They will be honored by the post office as a first class stamp no matter how much the postal rate increases. That's why they're called Forever stamps.  Use an online service for RSVP and simply include the web address on your invitations, saving the need for RSVP cards and extra postage. Consider including a phone number for those who may not have Internet access.  Buy your centerpiece flowers at a wholesale warehouse. Wholesale warehouses often sell products in bulk and cheaper than normal stores. You can often get 30-40 small centerpieces for less than $100 if you are willing to ask friends and family to help.  Have bouquets made of dried flowers or nice "silk" flowers instead of costly, fresh flowers. Cloth or ribbon flowers are also a lovely and durable option. Having the arrangements made days or weeks in advance can save time, money and stress.  If you do decide to go with fresh flowers, choose flowers that are in season. Possibly grow them yourself or buy the flowers in bulk at a Farmer's Market and arrange them yourself. Or, some trade schools that train florists will arrange wedding bouquets for the cost of the flowers.  If you simplify your flowers and arrangements, perhaps a close friend can assemble fresh or silk flowers, which will save you hundreds of dollars. Just make sure that they'll do an okay job and that you'll pay them either a small fee or take the arrangements as a wedding gift. You don't want them to feel taken advantage of!  , This might halve your flower budget. Consider having fewer flowers and less expensive flowers. Buy loose flowers and have the venue personnel or a talented friend place the flowers artfully in tall glass vases. (The arranging may be done for free, but check first!)  , Wedding cup cakes are getting more popular and they are not hard to make it yourself! Even better, you can get all the girlfriends and family members to help out. You can find great recipes over at the famous Cupcake Project website, which was designed to create unique recipes for wedding cupcakes.  Your baker can frost a few "pretend" tiers so your cake looks grand but saves you money. You can also purchase a sheet or round cake at a warehouse club or grocery store and have it done in the same color frosting as your wedding cake. You'll be able to feed more for less.   Also, figure about 20% fewer servings of cake than there are people. Many don't eat cake, so a lot of cake gets thrown away. At a cost of $2.00-$7.00 (average cake costs) per serving, it's heart-breaking to see forty pieces get thrown in the garbage.  This will save you enough that you could get a fancier recipe or fancier cake decorations if you really want and still spend less. This is because creating a structure to hold up multiply layers is challenging and time consuming for your baker.  Having candy for guests to eat instead of cake may save you money and provide a unique and memorable experience. Also, if you're going to have a candy "bar" or station, don't give away favors. The candy can also be a favor! There's no need to provide your guests with both.  Look for a dress at a thrift or consignment store or eBay and then have it altered. If you get a talents seamstress (or even better, if you know one!) this can help you get a designer look at a super bargain price! Altering is cheaper than you'd think, and you might even be able to negotiate for a discount if your bridal party also needs tailoring.  Consider a non-traditional dress that you could wear again after the wedding too. This will make the cost easier to justify. The days of strictly white dresses are gone and colored dresses are coming in to fashion. You can easily get a longer dress altered to cocktail length and then use that for Christmas parties and other formal gathers for years to come.  If all the groomsmen will be in tuxes and they don't already own one, use a tuxedo or menswear shop that gives you the groom's tux for free when you order others at the same time. This can save lots of money. Rentals can also save, if you don't plan on ever using the tux again.  The bridal stores charge outrageous prices for veils. Finding a cheap alternative can end up saving you a ton of cash! You can even try making your own veil or getting a crafty friend to do it for you!  , Your bridesmaids are responsible for the cost of their own attire. Try to be understanding about today's economy by choosing dresses from a less expensive source, including dress catalog companies.   First order one dress in an appropriate size for one of your girls and have her try it on. This way you can see up close the fabric quality, color, and style of the dress without buying several and then finding out you hate them. Even though returns are allowed, it's time consuming and you don't have time to waste.  You can choose different dresses for each girl but give them all one commonality such as color, a scarf, a belt or a shawl. By having the girls all in the same accessory, you weave a common thread that makes things look well put together. This can save money and time on ordering dresses, fittings, etc.  Make a list of the most important things you want for your wedding and have your fiancé do the same. Are you most committed to having gorgeous flowers, inviting 400 people, hosting the wedding at a particular location, or serving filet mignon and lobster? Knowing your priorities before the planning starts will help you decide what to spend money on, and what you don't mind doing cheaply or doing without.  This is difficult but sometimes necessary if the cost per guest is going to break your budget. Cross off names on the list of guests who might feel obligated to come to the wedding if they are invited, but would not have their feelings hurt if they are not asked to attend. Think of inviting only relatives with whom you have a close relationship instead of everyone related to you. Invite only the people who are important to you and your parents, rather than everyone you know.  You have to buy nice gifts for every member of your bridal party, and that adds up. Plus, traditionally, the entire bridal party plus their dates are invited to the rehearsal dinner. Seven bridesmaids and seven groomsmen, all their dates, ring bearer and flower girls, and their families, plus both sets of parents and all the readers in the ceremony, plus officiant could add up to 40+ people to feed!  , Professionally posed and properly lit photographs are one of the few beautiful keepsakes you'll have from your special day, but getting them doesn't have to break the bank. Choose an experienced photographer who will include all of the images on a CD for one low price. Then you can make as many inexpensive copies as you need rather than pay a huge reprint fee to the photographer.   Put together a list of the group shots you want, make a detailed timeline for the day, and give a copy to everyone on the shot list. Be sure to "pad" your schedule by 15 minutes so those who run late don't get left out. Also, consider a private pre-wedding encounter for the bride and groom followed by all of the posed photography. Completing everything before your wedding means you can spend the entire remainder of your day enjoying yourself and the company of your guests. (Guests don't really like to be kept waiting between the wedding and the reception.)  , If you are doing a round of toasts, guests can toast with whatever they are currently drinking instead of you having to purchase champagne for everyone. Instead of a limo, consider a regular vehicle. If you are happy with just serving beer and wine, skip the full bar and save a bundle on liquor. Consider a lovely formal dress that isn't a traditional gown from a bridal shop.  After looking at the final plan of your wedding, but before paying any deposits, decide where you can simplify the whole process. Consider whether you really need choral singers and a string quartet at the ceremony and a wedding singer and a DJ at the reception. Releasing doves or butterflies or having a candle-lighting ceremony are all wonderful, but may end up costing a lot of money. Simplicity saves money and if done well, your wedding may seem more serene and awe-inspiring.  Remember that the wedding is one day at the start of a life-long commitment. Look beyond the wedding day to the goals you will have as newlyweds. If you want to purchase a house in the next few years, keeping that as a priority throughout the wedding planning process will help you to be prudent about how much you spend on that one day.  

get bulk venue discounts.  consider a country or small town wedding.  carefully choose when you get married.  consider having your wedding any day but saturday.  have a day-time wedding.  consider having a friend or family member conduct the wedding ceremony.  have your ceremony and reception in the same location.  stick to the schedule for your ceremony and reception.  hire students to save on your music budget.  talk to a manager.  don't give away what you're doing.  team up with another bride.  skip flowers and use something simpler.  consider a centerpiece that doubles as something else.  ask friends to lend their talents by helping out with your invitations.  be smart on stamps.  make use of the internet!,  buy flowers from a warehouse.  try dried flowers to save money.  make smart choices on fresh flowers.  get a friend to make your flower arrangements.  take the flower arrangements from the ceremony to the reception.  use cupcakes!,  get "fake" cake.  consider a sheet cake instead of a tiered cake.  use a candy station.  alter a cheaper dress.  consider a non-traditional dress.  save on tuxes.  borrow a veil or buy one off ebay.  use a catalog to save on dresses.  let the bridesmaids use their own dresses.  prioritize and be realistic about what matters to you.  trim the guest list.  reduce the number of people in your bridal party.  save on photos.  consider altering tradition.  look for opportunities to streamline.  look beyond the wedding day. 

 Metal cutting bits are generally acceptable for metals, and will work for other materials such as wood and plastic, but ceramics, glass, and concrete require special bits to produce good results. Here are some bits to consider:   High speed steel bits are good for most non-abrasive materials that are hard enough for the bit to bite. This includes steel, aluminum, brass, and other common metals. They will also suffice for drilling wood, but are not as likely to give good results if splintering or splitting is a problem. Spade bits are suitable for wood, and give a fast, accurate cut, but can also cause splintering if the drill is allowed to wobble, or if too much pressure is applied. Titanium coated high speed bits are preferred for drilling hardened steel, stainless steel, and cast iron, as they can handle higher temperatures resulting from cutting these materials. Forstner bits give excellent results when drilling wood. Auger bits give fast results with some splintering when drilling wood. Carbide/Tungsten Carbide bits will drill through concrete and other hard aggregate as well as most stone materials. These can be difficult to start accurately, and also may require a percussion type drill like a rotary hammer or hammer drill to operate efficiently. Diamond embedded bits and hole saw type drill bits are suitable for hard ceramics and glass, but these material may shatter if good technique is not used.; , Measuring the distance between holes for multiple holes, aligning the hole with other members, and other factors should be considered when marking the hole.  This is especially valuable when drilling a curved piece of metal, such as through a round metal rod or a section of tubing. You can also use a punch to dimple wood, and even ceramic tile if you are careful.  If you are successful in drilling the hole without the bit slipping, and are satisfied with the results, step up to larger bits until you have a sufficiently large hole for your purpose.  This can be done by clamping a piece of material on the sides of the stock being drilled to keep the drill in place when operating it.  Ideally, if you can get access to one, a drill press with a V block or vise makes drilling accurate holes much simpler. 

obtain a suitable drill to use for the project.  locate the place where you need to drill your hole.  use a center punch where it is practical to dimple the material you are going to drill.  try drilling a pilot hole with a small diameter bit.  attach a guide jig to the surface if the pilot bit doesn't bite and begin cutting without slipping.  use a drill press to drill precise holes if you have one available.  practice the technique you select on scrap stock or material if you need precise results, and remember, working slowly and supporting the material will make your job easier.  

 Put it on medium heat with a grill rack on top. If you’re using a charcoal grill, get the coals going nice and hot.   Make sure your grill is clean before you use it. Put some vegetable oil on a paper towel and wipe down the grate, one by one. Using oil can also help to prevent sticking.  You can also halve small aubergines lengthwise instead of slicing vertically. Brush slices on all sides generously with olive oil, melted butter, or cooking oil. This adds flavor and keeps them from sticking to the grill rack, too.   Alternatively, you can grill eggplant whole or sliced in half over a medium to hot flame for 15 to 20 minutes until the skin is blackened. Pierce the skin when cooking aubergines this way to get heat into the center.  You can also brush the aubergine with oil-based marinade instead of the oil or butter. Any marinade that works on other vegetables will work on aubergine, too.  If you’re working with small slices, lining the grill with foil will be best to keep the slices from falling through the grate. It also keeps the oil on top and redistributable.   Pierce a few holes into the foil to allow the heat to transfer more quickly.  For both a charcoal and gas grill, place the aubergine on a rack directly above the heat. A gas grill should be covered; a charcoal grill should not.   When finished, turn off the heat, leave the foil, and transfer the aubergine to a plate. Give both the aubergine and the foil a few minutes to cool down before either are touched. The aubergine is now good to be added to a salad or a stir fry, or even eaten alone with your dipping sauce of choice. It can even be kept for later as part of a soup or stew.  

if you’re using a gas grill, preheat it.  peel the aubergine, if desired, and cut into 1/2-inch slices.  season as desired with herbs, salt, and ground black pepper.  line the grill with foil or place it directly onto the rack.  grill for about 8 minutes or until crispy and tender, turning occasionally. 

 If you want to be stubborn, then you have to know how to be firm about what you want. If you can’t say what you want clearly, calmly, and with confidence, then you won’t be able to be truly stubborn. However, if people see that you’re really serious about what you want, then they’ll be much less likely to try to change your mind or to think you’re a pushover.   Look people in the eye when you say what you want. Let them see that you mean it. If you look at the ground or away, it’ll look like you’re unsure of what you want. Speak slowly and clearly. Make sure you’re talking loudly enough so that people can hear you and see that you mean business. Use confident language. Instead of saying, “I was wondering if there was any chance you could let me borrow your car some time,” say, “I really need to borrow your car as soon as I can. I would really appreciate it if you could help me.”; , Another way to help yourself be assertive and stubborn when it comes to getting what you want is to provide concrete evidence for why you should get whatever it is you’re asking for. If you just state what you want without giving any reasons for why you need it or why it shouldn’t be that hard for the person you’re talking to to make it happen, then your request will sound wishy-washy, or like you haven’t put a lot of thought into it.   Make sure to plan what you’re going to say before you say it. Come up with an argument for what you want and what you’ll say to really prove it’s necessary. If you don’t have anything to say when the other person asks, “But why?” then it’ll look like you’re not really invested. Practice asking for what you want in front of a mirror or even with a friend. This can help you gain the confidence you need when you state your demands; it can also help you see if the evidence you’re planning on providing will really help your case. You can say something like, “Mom, I’d like to sleep over at Stella’s house tonight. You promised I could do it if I got my grades up last week, and I just got an ‘A’ on my English essay.”  , The trouble with being stubborn is that you may not be the only stubborn person in the room. Someone else may try to out-stubborn you and make you feel like there’s no chance that you will get what you want. If you’re facing a person like this, whether it’s a friend or an older sibling, then you have to be able to stand your ground and show them that they can’t change your mind.   Other people may put you down, call you names, or just make you feel like what you want is impossible. Learn to stick to what you want and not let them dissuade you. Don’t fight fire with fire. It’s better to be calm than to get emotional if your older sister is being mean to you when all you want to do is borrow her dress. This shows that you’re serious about what you want and need. Learn to stop caring about what people think. If you’re so concerned with having everyone like you or think highly of you, then it’ll be impossible to be stubborn.  You have to stop worrying about pleasing other people and remember that you’re the most important person in your life. This doesn’t mean you have to be completely selfish, but it does mean that you have to know when it’s best to look out for your own needs instead of what your friends or other people in your life may want. Sometimes you may have to let other people have their way, but there are times when you should know that you should really put yourself first.   For example, if you’re out with your best friend and she has always picked the movie you two are going to see together, then you should be comfortable with suggesting you want to see a different movie, even if you’ve always been a little scared of her moods. Sure, the people around you will be less happy if you disagree with them or say that you want something different from what they want. However, you will be less happy if you never get what you want, too.  Though sticking up for what you want is important, you may have more success if you don’t fight for absolutely every little thing you believe in. If you always fight for everything you want, from what toppings you want on your pizza to what you want to watch on TV, then people will have a hard time taking you seriously when you start fighting for something that really makes a big difference in your life. Make sure to pick your battles wisely, and to spend your effort on the things that really matter to you.   If you seem to fight the same amount for say, what you have for breakfast as for extending your curfew, then your parents or other people in your life will have a hard time taking you seriously. If you only fight for the things that really, really matter to you, then the people around you will be able to tell that you’re acting differently because whatever you want is non-negotiable. Let your tone, body language, and words show that you mean business this time.  There’s something to the saying that you’ll catch more flies with honey than vinegar. If you want to be stubborn and get what you want, then you’re more likely to see positive results when you treat the person you want help from kindly and with respect. Instead of attacking the person and instantly putting him or her on the defensive, try to be kind and to even offer a bit of flattery, at first.   For example, instead of saying, “Mom, you never let me do anything fun. Why can’t you let me see a movie with Amy?” you can say something like, “Mom, do you think I could see a movie with Amy tonight? I would really be grateful if you let me do that.” Of course, if being kind or even giving the person a bit of sincere flattery doesn’t work, then you may have to try a tougher approach. But starting things off on a positive note should be your best bet.  If you want to be stubborn about something that is harder to achieve, then you’ll have be determined to get what you want at all costs. To really succeed in something like wanting to be an actress or writing a book, you’ll have to make an effort to set small goals that help you achieve your larger goal in order to be stubborn and persistent enough to get what you want.   Make a list of all of the things you need to do to reach your goal. If you’re not sure what all of the steps of the process entail, then you should talk to an expert in whatever you want to achieve to get a better sense of the measures you need to take. If you focus on meeting small goals one at a time, then you’ll be much more likely to reach that larger goal than you would be if you were only focused on crawling toward that big picture. For example, if you want to write the first draft of a novel, break it up chapter by chapter. You’ll have to learn to ignore all of the doubters along the way. There will be plenty of people who will want you to feel like there’s no way you can succeed. Don’t let them stop you.  Some people let too much discouragement get them down. However, if you’re really stubborn about getting what you want and doing what’s best for you, then you have to be able to accept all of the people who are telling you you can’t get what you want. Whether you’re trying to land a role in a film, find an agent for your novel, or make the volleyball team, tell yourself that if you keep trying, you’ll be able to do whatever you want, no matter what people say.   Remind yourself that most great people have dealt with their fair share of rejection before becoming successes. Michael Jordan didn’t even make his high school basketball team! Let that rejection motivate you to keep working instead of bringing you down. That said, you shouldn’t ignore the rejection all together. If everyone who is rejecting you is telling you the same thing, then you may be able to use the advice you’re getting to improve. The most important thing is that you’re confident in what you’re doing. If you really believe in what you want and know you deserve it, then it’ll be easier to deal with the rejection.  So you’ve tried to be nice, and that has gotten you nowhere. If you feel like you’ve tried being diplomatic, kind, and understanding and you’re no better off than you were when you started, then you may need to take a different approach. Sure, you may be a bit annoying by being a broken record and repeating what you want again and again, but who says it won’t help you get what you want?”   Continue saying what you want, or talking about what you want, until the person you’re talking to is so frustrated with you or annoyed that he just gives in. Sure, it won’t be pretty, but it’ll help you get closer to where you need to go. Just fold your arms over your chest and say what you want. Be firm in what you believe and don’t be ashamed of acting this way! If you’ve tried to be nice, then you need to try a different approach.  Another way to be truly stubborn is simply not to budge until the person you’re with gives in to your demands. This can mean staying in your seat at a restaurant long after you’ve eaten your meal, staying at home when you and the person you’re with need to get going somewhere, or even stopping and sitting down on the ground wherever you want until you get what you want. Sure, this may embarrass the person you’re with, but if you really don’t care about that, then this may be the best way to get what you’re asking for!   This can be especially effective if the person is really depending on you to get up, like if you’re supposed to be giving him a ride somewhere. Sure, this may not be the most sophisticated approach, but it may be the most effective. Some people will quickly give in in the face of embarrassment.  Another way to be stubborn is to just ignore the person who is telling you you can’t do a certain thing. Act like you literally can’t hear the person until he or she lets you have what you want. This can mean blankly staring at the person in front of you, as if you don’t hear him or her turning you down at all, putting your fingers in your ears and saying, “I can’t hear you!” or just shrugging and walking away.   Sure, this isn’t the world’s most mature approach, but if you’re really determined to get what you want, then this may help you get it at any cost.  Another way to be stubborn and to get whatever you want is to bargain with the person you’re asking for help. Think for a minute and see if there’s something you can do for the person, so it feels less like a give give, and more like a give and take. If you have some ideas for how you can be of use to the person, then this will make it feel more like an exchange than a case of you just getting what you want.   For example, you can ask your mother to let you hang out with your friends in exchange for doing the laundry over the weekend for her. This will make your question much more appealing. If you want to borrow your sister’s sweater, offer to let her borrow the new dress of yours that she really likes.  Though this is a cheap trick, sometimes shedding a tear or two can help you get what you want, especially if you’re in public. If your parents, siblings, or person you’re with won’t let you get your way, try getting really upset, crying, throwing a bit of a fit, or just showing how much you want whatever you’re not getting. Not only will this emphasize how much you want to get whatever you’re asking for, but it will also have the bonus effect of embarrassing the person you’re with into letting you have your way.   If you don’t care about embarrassing yourself, try asking for whatever you want in an extra public place and then have a meltdown when you don’t get what you want so the person you’re with gets extra embarrassed. If this doesn’t backfire and make the person even more angry with you, it can actually be just embarrassing enough that you may win. You can practice your hissy fit in advance if you think that’ll make your act more convincing.  At the end of the day, being stubborn is all about sticking to your guns and getting what you want—and what you deserve. If you lose sight of your goals or needs, then you’ll be likely to give in to people or to give up because it’s simply easier than creating conflict. However, if you repeat what you want and why you want it to yourself, or even write it down on a piece of paper and read it over periodically, then you’ll be more likely to be stubborn about what you want—and to get it.   Sure, it’s easier to shrug your shoulders and say that you’ll be okay with not getting what you want, but if that’s your attitude, then you’ll never be happy. Remember that being stubborn is a good thing when it comes to following your heart and asking for what you really want in life. Be proud of yourself for being firm, sticking up for yourself, and not letting other people boss you around.  

be firm about your demands.  provide evidence for your beliefs.  don’t let other people bully you away from your needs.  look out for yourself.  pick your battles.  be respectful to the person you’re asking for help.  set goals and meet them.  deal with rejection constructively.  be a broken record.  refuse to move until you get what you want.  completely ignore the person who doesn’t agree with you.  bargain.  get emotional.  don’t forget your reasons for wanting what you want. 

 If the wall has previously been rendered and the plaster is deteriorating, start by sawing or raking as much of the old plaster away as possible. Once the old render is removed, wet the wall using a garden hose. Apply more water to walls made from very porous materials.; , Renders are a mixture of only 3 ingredients: lime, sand, and water. Portland cement can be substituted for a portion of the lime, which will result in a stronger, but less breathable plaster. Use either hydrated lime or lime putty, and mix 1 part lime to 3 parts sand in a large bucket or wheelbarrow. You must use sand with sharp, angular grains; masonry sand is the ideal choice. Add just enough water to form the mixture into a stiff, workable paste.  Render is most effective when it is applied in several layers, and the first layer is called the scratch coat. Apply the render to the wall as forcefully as possible to ensure that it keys into the wall well; throwing clumps of render from a trowel or from your hands in the best method. Smooth the render across the wall with a trowel. Never make repeated passes with the trowel over the same area; this will bring the lime to the surface and leave you with a weak, lime-depleted section underneath.  Once the first coat of render is applied but not yet set, scratch the surface throughout the wall to provide a key for the next layer to adhere to. These scratches can be applied using a hand cultivator or the edges of a trowel.  Once the first coat has been scratched and allowed to set most of the way, wet the wall again with the hose. Apply the second coat of render in the same manner as the first. If a third coat is desired, scratch the surface of the current coat to provide a key. If not, let the render dry slowly, and you are done rendering the wall.  

prepare the wall for rendering.  mix the render.  apply the scratch coat of render to the wall.  scratch the first coat of render to prepare it for a second coat.  apply the second coat of render to the wall. 

 Hold the horse's lead rope loosely but securely in one hand. Leave the other hand free to stroke the horse, and to grab treats. You should keep the treats in a pocket well out of reach of the horse, so that it won't be tempted to reach and grab them.Remember to always retain control of the horse's treats, only allowing the horse to eat one when it does what you want. If the horse figures out it can get the treats from you without doing what you want, it may be very difficult to train.  The idea is to encourage your horse to lower its head as far as it is willing to. Move the treat down, towards its feet, until it is reluctant to lower it further, then praise the horse and allow it to eat the treat. This will teach the horse to associate lowering its nose at your command with receiving treats.If the horse does not seem to understand, you can encourage it to lower its head with a light, constant tug downwards on its lead rope. Don't try to force the horse's head (it's stronger than you), and don't tug suddenly or violently on the rope.  Now that the horse is able to reach down, you will want to start training it to do so on command. Continue practicing the excercise with a treat presented below the horse's legs, but start incorporating spoken commands along with the treats. Choose something short and simple like "bow down". State the command before you offer the treat between the horse's legs.Repeat the command throughout the exercise. Then reward and praise the horse.  Accomplish this by holding the treat further and further towards the ground, rewarding the horse only when it lowers its head further than it did on the previous attempt. Repeat until the horse is bending its neck nearly to the ground, or even bending one of its front legs slightly. 

stand in front of the horse.  offer a treat below the horse's nose.  begin incorporating commands.  gradually encourage the horse to reach further down.

 In order to begin to understand how the concept of Spaces works, you'll need to open the Mission Control screen. This shows you the spaces you have active—each of the numbered desktops at the top of the screen represents a space. There are three different ways to access Mission Control:   Press the "F3" key. Click on the "Mission Control" icon on your dock. If you have a trackpad, push upwards on the pad with three fingers.; , To move an active program to its own space, simply drag it with the mouse and drop it on the chosen space.   To open up an additional desktop space from Mission Control, move your mouse towards the top-right of the screen. A "+" sign will appear. Click it, and an additional space will open, up to the total limit of 16 spaces.       To remove an open desktop space, move your mouse the the space at the top of the Mission control screen, and click the "x" that appears in the top left. If you have any open programs on the space that you close, they will be automatically moved to your first space.  When you click on a space, Mission Control will disappear and your display will show only the space you selected.

 You're going to tell her something pretty significant, and it's best if you don't drop it on her while she's already got her hands full with your dad crashing the car, your brother needing 10 teeth pulled, your sister getting a tattoo and the IRS breathing down her neck. Also try to be aware of the fact that your mom probably doesn't have the first clue about what it means to be gay, so be prepared to spend some time with her.; , Going to a restaurant is nice, but for something this important it's better to do it alone.  It can be hard just getting started. Try to gradually lean towards the subject.  Tell your mom that you love her. Tell her that you care about and respect her as your mother and that what you're about to say is very important.  Be calm and resist the temptation to intone the news in a bleak, depressed manner. Don't assume she's going to freak out. Tell her quickly, calmly, and in a matter-of-fact way that shows her that you're fine with it, and want her to be, too.  Allow her to let it sink in for a minute or two. Remember that this is probably going to be a big deal to her.   Prepare for a wide range of emotional responses, everything from rage to disbelief, or grief to fear. Deal with her questions immediately. Common questions from Moms include: Is it my fault? What happened to you to make you this way? Is this because you were raped? Many times when faced with the news that a child is gay, a parent will search for a reason. Avoid allowing her to attach "blame" to anyone or any incident. For example, "No, Mom, it's not anybody's fault. It's just who I am, the same as being right handed or having green eyes." or "If I'm gay because I was molested, why are so many others who were molested not gay? Being molested doesn't determine sexual orientation, though it really can mess you up. I'm gay because I'm gay. Not because someone touched me when I was a kid."  , Explain to her when you realized it, how you have been struggling to accept it yourself and then tell her, and if there's someone special, without revealing a lot of details at this point, simply let her know you have been seeing someone. This is important so she can understand you and your feelings better.  Let her talk and listen to what she has to say. Try to understand her feelings as a mother. She had certain plans for your life, which she may have just harbored in her heart, but part of the plan was very probably to be at your wedding, and seeing your children born. Those things may still happen, but in a way very different from what she pictured, and she may grieve for what she perceives right now as the "loss" of those dreams. Be as compassionate as you can in expressing that you understand some of her feelings, but be firm and let her know those were her dreams - not yours. Encourage her that it's now time to dream a new dream.  

make sure your mom is not already dealing with some other stressful situation.  sit down and try to talk in private away from strangers.  start up the conversation.  try not to inject drama.  tell her that you're gay.  give her a moment.  discuss it with her openly now that she knows.  allow her to express her feelings. 

 You'll need 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of white glue (also called school glue) and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of liquid starch, the kind that's used to starch shirts. These ingredients will give you a small batch of sticky tack. If you want a larger batch, just remember to use the ratio of 2 parts glue and 1 part starch.  Put them in a container and use a spoon to mix them together. The mixture will immediately begin to stiffen, due to the interaction between the glue and starch. Soon it will form the consistency of sticky tack.  Use blue or another fun color to color your sticky tack if you'd like. Add just a few drops, since a little goes a long way. Stir it in so that the ball of sticky tack gets thoroughly colored.  Scoop the sticky tack into your hands and knead it so that it becomes firm, but pliable. If you think it feels a little sticky, work in a little more starch. If it's too dry to stick, add a bit more glue. Keep working the sticky tack until it reaches the consistency you want.  Pinch of a few small pieces to hang a poster or picture. You can store the sticky tack you don't use in an airtight jar or another container. If it gets a little dry before you use it again, you can add more glue and work it in with your hands to achieve the right texture again.         

measure out your glue and starch.  mix the glue and starch.  add a few drops of food coloring.  knead it with your hands.  use or store the sticky tack.

 Ice works by hardening the gum and allowing it to be chipped out of the hair.          This method is known to be more painful than other methods, because the cold gum still has to be yanked out of the hair., If your hair is very long, you can close your hair inside the freezer. For those with short hair, apply an ice cube to the affected area and wrap it in a plastic bag. Hold it there for twenty minutes.          You can also apply salt water to your hair beforehand to lower the freezing temperature of the ice.  When the gum is hard and breakable, you will be able to chip it out of your hair. If it starts to soften, freeze it again.          If the gum is too stuck to your hair to pull off, you can add a small amount of cooking oil to it and freeze it again.  

try ice.  use an ice wrap to harden the gum.  chip the hardened gum out of your hair. 

 When it comes to turmeric stains, time is of the essence. Turmeric is used as a fabric dye in many parts of the world for a reason — once it sets in, it's very tricky to get out.As soon as you notice a stain on your clothing or fabric, immediately use a clean spoon to remove any excess turmeric that may be present. Then, rinse with water and dab with a towel. Treating with hand sanitizer and then rinsing may also be effective on less-porous surfaces. Resist the urge to rub or scrub, as this can spread the stain or grind it in.   Another traditional solution sometimes used to remove liquid turmeric stains is to pack absorbent powder (like flour, cornmeal, or baking soda) around the stain and allow it to sit. Within a few minutes, you should notice the powder soaking up some of the liquid, which allows it to safely be brushed away.; , Pour a small dab of all-purpose liquid detergent directly onto the stain and scrub gently with a soft toothbrush or towel soaked with water. Scrub both sides of the fabric with detergent for several minutes (taking care not to wear a hole into the fabric), then let it sit for about 10 minutes to allow the detergent to soak in.   Don't scrub with a dry brush or towel — only use water and detergent. As noted above, rubbing with a dry tool can grind the turmeric into the fabric, making it even trickier to remove.  Drop your garment or fabric into the washing machine and wash it on the hottest setting. Add the same type and amount of detergent as you normally would for the garment. Wash for one cycle on the hottest setting allowed on the item's care label.   If you have a load of similar clothing, you can also wash it with your stained garment to avoid wasting water.  After your garment has finished washing, remove it and inspect the stain (serious stains may not yet have disappeared). If the weather outside is good, hang your clothing out to dry on a wire or drying rack in direct sunlight. The bleaching power of the sun is well-documented — in fact, in the past, it was one of the main ways people kept their whites white.Sun drying can help minimize turmeric stains on any color of garment. However, note that sun drying cause colored fabrics to fade slightly, so you may want to avoid using this technique for especially brightly-colored clothes.   Don't leave any sort of clothing or fabric (even whites) in the sun for days on end. This can accelerate the natural wear and tear of the fabric, leading to weakened fibers and a susceptibility to tearing.  Turmeric stains can be remarkably persistent. While quickly pre-treating with detergent and washing your soiled garment or fabric is almost always a wise choice, it may not necessarily remove your stain on the first attempt. Be ready to repeat this cycle several times for the best results (or, as an alternative, try subbing in one of the home remedies below).  One extra option that you have for treating white fabrics is bleach. This powerful, corrosive detergent can strip the color from fabric remarkably quickly, making it a great choice for removing turmeric from your whites. Try adding a few spoonfuls of bleach to a bucket of hot water and soaking your white clothes in this wash for about 15 minutes before sending them through the wash.   To be clear, you will probably not want to use this method for colored clothing. Exposure to bleach can cause bright colors to rapidly fade — in high doses, it can even remove the color entirely. You will also want to avoid using bleach for silk, wool, or mohair, as it can permanently damage these fabrics. For white silks and wools, try using hydrogen peroxide, a milder alternative.  One easy stain-removal trick uses the natural properties of everyday baking soda to beat tough turmeric stains. To try this method, scoop a few spoonfuls of baking soda into a small bowl, then add a small amount of water to make a thick, moist paste. Use a soft toothbrush or towel to scrub turmeric stains in fabric with the paste before running them through the wash. Alternatively, use the paste as a very mild abrasive to help take stains out of hard surfaces like kitchen counter tops.   Baking soda is a great cleaning agent for several reasons — it's crystal structure makes it mildly abrasive without making it damaging to most surfaces, its mild alkalinity allows it to cut through grease, and it's a natural deodorizer, which can be particularly useful even if won't remove your turmeric stain., Another easy home remedy for fighting stains (including those from turmeric) is white vinegar. Try mixing a tablespoon or two with about 1/2 cup of rubbing alcohol or 2 cups of warm water and dish soap, then soaking a rag and gently soaking a fresh turmeric stain. Blot with a dry cloth to absorb the liquid. Repeat for several minutes and allow to dry. Over several repetitions, you should notice the vinegar's natural acidity cause the stain to begin to fade.   Only use white vinegar — never red wine or balsamic. These alternatives can contain dyes that can cause their own tough-to-remove stains.  Glycerin, also known as glycerine, is a natural chemical produced in the process of making soap and processing animal fat. It is often available at pharmacies and specialty stores for a small price. Mixed with ordinary dish soap and water, glycerin can make a powerful cleaning solution that's ideal for fighting even the worst stains. Try mixing about 1/4 cup of glycerin with 1/4 cup dish soap and 2 cups of water, then soaking a rag in this solution and gently rubbing (or, if you're dealing with fabric, dabbing) your turmeric stain to treat it.  For surfaces like kitchen counter tops, stove tops, and floors, you don't have to be as gentle as you do with clothing and fabrics. In these cases, try accompanying any of the cleaning methods in this article with some mild abrasive action to help scour your stain away. Sponges, abrasive pads, brushes, and rags are all great tools for wiping or rubbing away turmeric stains on hard surfaces. Even abrasive pastes, like the baking soda one described above, can work well. Don't use harsh abrasives (like steel wool) or metal scrapers, however, as these can leave permanent scratches on the surface.   For extra cleaning power, try soaking the stain in a mixture of hot water and soap for five minutes before using your abrasive. If you don't have one, you may want to try a "magic eraser"-style cleaning sponge. These are usually available at grocery and department stores for a fairly affordable price and work with a microscopic abrasive action to effectively remove stains., Some home care experts swear by clear, bubbly, flavorless beverages like soda water or club soda when it comes to cleaning, while others claim they are no better than ordinary water. In fact, there is very little scientific evidence either way.However, because soda water is so mild, it definitely won't hurt any fabric, clothing, or surface that's stained with turmeric, so feel free to use it without worry. Try wetting a rag with soda water and using it to soak a fresh stain or pouring soda water on a stain on a hard surface, letting it soak for five minutes, then rubbing with a sponge or rag to lift the stain away.   Don't use tonic water or a clear soft drink — though they look identical to soda water, these liquids contain sugar, which can make a sticky mess when it dries.  Sometimes, no matter how many times you soak, pre-treat, dry, wash, and repeat, you just can't remove a turmeric stain from your clothing. In this case, you don't necessarily have to throw your stained clothing out or wear it in spite of the stain. Instead, try altering it so that the stain is no longer a problem. For instance, if you've got a light-colored garment with a prominent turmeric stain, try tie-dying it. Bury the stain in a swirl of bright colors and no one will be the wiser!  , If you've got turmeric to spare, another way to hide a bright turmeric stain is simply to stain the entire garment with the same type of turmeric. Turmeric, which is sometimes purposely used as a fabric dye, is well-suited for amateur dying. This process will usually result in a final product that ranges from bright yellow to orange-red, which can make a fine addition to a summer wardrobe.   You can find a variety of instructions for using turmeric in dying projects online (like, for instance, here).  If the stain is in a choice location, you may be able to over it simply by stitching over it. For instance, if you have a turmeric stain in the very middle of the chest of your tee shirt, stitching an elaborate, flowery logo over the stain will conceal it and give you an opportunity to make your shirt truly unique. If you're willing to go with an asymmetrical design, you can embroider virtually any part of your clothing, so be creative!  , Some stained clothing just can't seem to be rescued no matter what — not only can the stain not be removed, but it also can't be covered up or obscured with your own alterations. In these cases, think twice before you throw your clothing away! Stained clothes are a great source of perfectly good fabric that can be re-purposed in a wide variety of ways. Below are just a few possible uses for fabric from stained clothing to get you started:   Curtains Quilts Dishrags Head/wristbands Upholstery Rugs.  

remove excess turmeric quickly.  pre-treat with detergent.  wash in warm or hot water.  dry in direct sunlight.  repeat as needed.  bleach white fabrics.  try using baking soda paste.  use a cleaning solution with vinegar.  treat stains with glycerin.  try treating hard surfaces with mild abrasives.  consider soaking in soda water.  tie-dye your garment.  stain the entire garment.  cover with embroidery.  use the fabric for something else. 

 The protein and fat content in the food provides your dogs with the energy they need to run long distances. Whatever you feed your dogs, they should be taking in around 10,000 calories each day when they’re on the trail.Some mushers mix a cup or two of water into the food to help the dogs digest the food more easily and prevent dehydration. Adding water is also necessary when thawing out frozen food on the trail.Many sled dogs also like fish. Be sure to cook it thoroughly and remove bones before feeding it to your dogs. Feeding a sled dog can be expensive, with costs totaling up to $500 per year.; , Place water in a pan or bowl that won’t spill. A deep, heavy ceramic water bowl is best since, unlike flimsy metal or plastic bowls, they are less likely to be knocked over.   Empty the bowl each day and fill it with fresh water. Clean the pan or bowl at least once each week to prevent food residue and bacteria from building up. Always ensure your dogs have had plenty to drink before going on a run., Sled dogs are bred for cold temperatures. However, even the hardiest sled dogs have their limits. The temperature a dog can comfortably handle varies depending on its age, coat, and overall health, and there is no absolute temperature at which dogs should be kept from the elements.However, stay attentive to your dogs’ behavior and attitude, and look for changes that might occur in extreme weather. If your dogs are shivering, curled up in the snow and not moving, or engaging in other behavior that indicates they are unable to tolerate the temperature, don’t force them to continue running.Dogs can get frostbite, so always use caution if you suspect your dogs are at risk.In extreme weather, dress your dogs in special coats and blankets to give them an added layer of protection against the cold. Wash your dogs at least once a month. Use a mild soap or shampoo specially designed for dogs that won’t dry out their skin. Special dog shampoos are available at pet stores.  Take care to watch for behavior that indicates your dog is struggling or in pain, including labored breathing, yelping, an inability to keep pace with other dogs, and/or bloody paws or prints.   Know when to retire your sled dogs.Most dogs can only run until they are 10 years old. No dog should be running beyond the age of 15 years old.  Many races require that your dogs are up-to-date on their shots and vaccines.When getting their shots, your vet should also examine the dogs for other illnesses or problems. Sled dogs are more likely to have joint problems then regular dogs, so if you catch the problem early, it could save your dog a lot of pain later and keep your team strong.   Email the International Sled Dog Veterinary Medical Association at ISDVMA@isdvma.org to find a sled dog vet near you.  

feed your dogs adequately.your dogs should eat a mix of high-quality dry and wet (canned) food with high levels of fat and protein.  ensure your dogs have enough to drink.sled dogs need access to water at all times to ensure they don’t become dehydrated.  protect your dogs’ skin.  don’t push your dogs beyond what they can endure.excessive speed when sledding can lead to injuries, dehydration, and stress.  take your dogs to the vet regularly. 

 Do some research online and find jewelry stores nearby. You will want to go to several stores, so ideally the stores you go to should be close together as opposed to hours apart.   Go online to their sites and look at prices. It’s better to eliminate certain stores from the get go rather than go there and realize they are out of your price range.  You don’t want to only go to one store when you are buying a promise ring. It puts too much pressure on just one buying experience, and you may come out with a ring that they won’t like. Instead, try to go to at least three different places. Think about going to at least one larger, more well known store, and also to a smaller, boutique-style jeweler.You may find very different offerings between the two. Think about bringing a friend along who can help you. Also consider bringing someone who knows your significant other well and who knows what they do and don't like.  Be honest and direct about your price point, material preference, and style of ring you are looking for. The salesperson can direct you to the best rings for you, and it could save you time. You also will be less distracted and won’t leave with a ring that isn’t exactly what you want.  At some big jewelry stores, salespeople are paid by commission. Don’t feel like you need to leave with a ring that day, and don’t let them try to sell you anything outside your price range. Stand firm in what you want and if in doubt, leave with a business card and decide what ring you want after you have seen all your options. , Buying a promise ring online can save you money. If you are underwhelmed by the rings that you see in jewelry stores, or if you are worried about spending too much, look online. Stick to reputable sites and look up customer reviews of the online stores. Make sure to keep measurements in mind when you are shopping online. Sometimes on a screen a ring can look much smaller or larger than it actually is, so always carefully look at the measurements listed in the description. If you are considering buying a ring with gems or diamonds, make sure the online site is certified by a trade association like the Jewelers of America, the American Gem Society or the Gemological Institute of America. , Before buying your ring, make sure there is an exchange policy. As hard as you worked to pick a ring that they'll like, there’s the possibility that they will want a different one. Do not buy a ring if there is no way to return it. If you are buying an engraved or personalized ring, make sure the return policy covers your ring.  If you have the money up front, go ahead and buy the ring! If you don’t have the money, you have a couple options. The best thing to do would be to wait a couple months until you have enough money.   Many jewelers also have payment plans that are interest free for a certain number of months. Keep in mind that you may have to open a retail credit card with the jeweler, and if you fail to pay on time it could affect your credit.  

look for jewelers in your area.  go to several stores.  tell a salesperson what you are looking for.  don’t let yourself be pressured.  buy a ring online.  make sure there is an exchange policy.  pay for the ring. 

 Pluck the feathers, and skin the bird. Cut off the head and feet. Clean out the intestinal cavity.   Place the bird in a large pot of boiling water, if you have not used the other method to clean your bird. There should be enough water in the pot to keep the bird submerged, but not too much to boil over. This method will soften the feathers to allow them to be easily plucked. After boiling the bird until it's softened, cut off the head and feet and then clean out the intestinal cavity. There is not an exact boiling time, as this will be determined by the size of the turkey.; , This will help the meat to stay tender. You can either fry or bake your wild turkey. There are a variety of wild turkey recipes available.  The additional basting liquid will prevent the turkey from drying out, which will help tenderize the meat. An ideal baking temperature is 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Cook the turkey for approximately 15 minutes per lb., or 30 minutes per kg. The turkey is considered done when the internal temperature, which is measured with a meat thermometer at the thickest point of the bird, reaches at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit (77 degrees Celsius).  This is ideal if you don't like the idea of baking the turkey. The fat and oil from the fryer will help keep the turkey moist. Deep frying should never be done inside due to the risk of fire. Pay special attention to the oil levels, as you do not want the oil to spill out of the fryer once the turkey has been added. Cook the turkey at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) for 3 to 3.5 minutes per lb. (6 to 7 minutes per kg) or until the turkey has a golden brown color.  

clean your bird.  slice off the outer layer of muscle on the turkey breast prior to cooking it.  bake the turkey the same way you would a store-bought turkey of its size, but baste it more frequently.  deep fry the turkey in a special outdoor deep fryer. 

 Make sure the two tunes you're going be double dropping are keyed correctly. You can pick up key analyzers relatively cheaply these days (try Mixed in Key) or if you're a musical bod you can probably do it by ear with a keyboard. The thing is, if you're going to be playing two tunes together they, need to compliment each other musically or all the DJ skill in the world won't make them sound good together. For the sake of example, two tunes with the most drum 'n' bass that DJs should have kicking around; , This means both of these tunes could be played from start to finish and there would not be a key clash anywhere.  If you're using vinyl you should already know that you can see the drops on your record. In the case of Dubplate Killas, it can be seen that there is a dark section at the beginning of the record, followed by a smaller, lighter section, followed by a large dark section that makes up the main body of the tune. To plan the mix out, it needs to be broken down into 16bar sections. So if we listen and count the beats, you will see that there are have two 16bars sections of beats, then one 16bar section of build before the bass comes in. Where the bass comes in is the most important part of the record as far as double dropping is concerned as it's this point on both records that you will want to occur simultaneously. If you now look at Where's My Money, you can see there is a smaller, lighter section before the dark section of bass comes in. Listening and counting, you see this tune has two 16bar sections before the bass comes in. So, if you start playing Dubplate Killas, you will wait for one 16bar section to play before starting Where's My Money. Now the tunes will both play through their remaining two 16bar sections and both of their basslines will come in together!  , It is recommended to use the time display to judge drops. The time that sections come in roughly on a 175bpm tune are as follows   1 16 bar section = 0.21 secs 2 16 bar sections = 0.42 secs 3 16 bar sections = 1.06 secs 4 16 bar sections = 1.28 secs  , Set this as your cue point, then mix in from here for rapid fire beat dropping!  , As you approach your mixing point, for example, the part when both basslines come in together, make sure the gains on your tunes are pretty much level, cut the bass on Dubplate Killas and pump the bass on Where's My Money. Boom! You now have two tunes playing as one, creating a bespoke live remix on the spot! From here, you can have a bit of fun, cutting bassline phrases in and out of one another, creating a mash up!  

select.  listen to j majik and wickaman - dubplate killas  then listen to tc - where's my money  both of these tunes are in b-flat minor, or have camelot mixing code 3a.  cueing - how you go about cueing your tunes will depend largely on what medium you've chosen to dj through.  nb - cd mixing - unless you are in the privileged position of owning cdj 1000's, which give you a vinyl-esque readout of the drops in a tune, it can be difficult to judge your drops by section.  using these values can be useful for forward cueing a tune, for example if you want to drop a beat with a four 16bar section intro in quickly, you would search to 1.06 secs, then move around a bit until you find a cymbal or the end of a drum roll that usually signifies the start of a section.  mixing - this is pretty much down to preference. 

 Even though you may know someone by a nickname, a prison record will have the person's full legal name.   Most criminal records include listings of aliases or other known names, but typically are only searchable by a person's legal first and last name. Keep in mind you may think you have the person's full legal name when in fact you don't. If you hit a dead-end in your search and cannot find the person, this more than likely is because you don't have his or her legal name. For example, someone may go by his middle name instead of his first name.; , Other identifying information, such as a birthdate, can help narrow your search results and enable you to find someone in jail more easily.   Searching social media can help you learn some of these details. You also may want to ask friends or family of the person, if they are known and available to you. This is particularly important if the person you're trying to find has a relatively common name. For example, if you're looking for John Smith, your search of either a state or federal inmate database may turn up many inmates with that name. Additional details can help you find the correct entry more efficiently. The most efficient way to find someone in jail is to look them up by their inmate ID number, but chances are you won't have this information until after you've found them in an inmate database.  The name and location of the court may provide clues to the location and type of correctional facility where the person is serving time.   As an initial matter, you must find out if the person was convicted of a state or federal crime. Anyone convicted of a crime in federal court will be in a federal prison, whereas someone convicted of a state crime may be in a state jail or prison. Typically a person convicted in a state court will be serving his or her sentence in a correctional facility in the same state. However, the person may have been transferred if, for example, she was a resident of one state but committed a crime in another. The location of the person within the state also may depend on the availability of space in nearby jails and prisons., Since where someone is serving time often depends on the type and degree of crime he or she was convicted of committing, criminal records can help you figure out where the inmate is located.   Keep in mind that you may be charged a small fee to conduct full searches of criminal records, but you should be able to get basic information such as the crime for which the person was convicted for free. The National Center for State Courts has a directory of online criminal records available for each state.People convicted of less serious offenses typically are housed in county jails, while those convicted of more serious or violent offenses probably are in state prisons. Jails tend to hold non-violent offenders serving shorter sentences, while prisons have greater security and restrictions and are designed for violent offenders serving longer sentences. 

confirm the person's legal name.  collect additional information.  determine the court where the person was convicted.  search criminal court records. 

 If you want to smell your best, it starts with getting clean. How often you should bathe depends on your personal body chemistry, your daily activities and the weather. Many people bathe once a day, but if you play a sport or live in a hot region you might want to jump in the tub more than once. If your skin is really dry, every other day might be enough. But no matter what, make sure you bathe often enough that your body odor doesn't become noticeable to other people.   In the shower, wash your skin with soap and warm water to make sure you rinse away the dirt, sweat and bacteria that causes body odor. When in doubt, go ahead and rinse off! Trying to mask body odor with deodorant or perfume doesn't really work. If you don't want to wash your hair every day (many say it leads to dry and damaged hair), use dry shampoo to freshen your hair on days you don't wash. It's composed of powders that absorb the oil that makes your hair look greasy.; , Two percent of people have a gene that prevents their armpits from producing body odor.They're the lucky ones, right? The rest of us rely on deodorant to keep body odor at bay throughout the day. Put some on after you shower, and reapply as necessary throughout the day.   Consider choosing a deodorant/antiperspirant combination if you tend to get a little sweaty. Deodorants come in solid sticks, gel sticks, or sprays. You also buy natural rock deodorant, or even make your own using baking soda and coconut oil. Experiment with the deodorant that feels the most comfortable and keeps you smelling the best. If you plant to wear perfume or cologne, it's not necessary to use a highly-scented deodorant. You don't want to wear too many different scents at once.  Sprinkling on a little body powder after your bath or shower is a great way to stay fresh. Just dry off completely, then put some under your arms, on your feet, and anywhere else you'd like. The powder helps to keep your skin dry and cool during the day, so it comes in handy on hot, humid days.   You can buy body powder formulated for adults or just pick up some baby powder - it works just as well. You might want to get an unscented version, though, since baby powder has a distinctive smell. Don't want to buy body powder? Make it! All you need is cornstarch. If you want to scent your body powder, soak a cotton ball in your favorite perfume or essential oil. Put the cotton ball in a jar and cover it with cornstarch. Apply the body powder using a fluffy makeup applicator., Wearing the same clothes several days in a row can affect the way you smell, so make sure you keep up on your laundry! Choose to use a scented detergent or an unscented one - it doesn't matter, as long as your clothes are clean.   You might want to carry a few backup items to change into if you're going to be out all day. Some people like to keep a fresh pair of underwear, tights, socks or an undershirt on hand for emergencies. If you work in a place with a strong smell or you're around smoke a lot, you might have to take extra care to keep your clothes smelling great. Laundering them more frequently and using a strong-smelling detergent and fabric softener should do the trick. Get your winter coat and other unwashable items dry cleaned every few months to keep them from getting smelly. Speaking of clothes, check out your bags, backpacks, hats and other accessories, too. Wash these items every once in a while, especially if you use them every day.  If you're worried about how your feet smell, take extra care to scrub your feet in the shower, dry them completely, and sprinkle them with body or foot powder before you put on your socks and shoes. Carry an extra pair of socks to change into later in the day. Make sure your shoes are in good shape, too - old shoes can be a source of bad smells.   Have a separate pair of shoes you use when you work out, rather than wearing your running shoes to school or work. Carry a small bottle of foot powder with you so you can use it when you need to during the day. When possible, wear socks with your shoes. Going without socks tends to make your feet sweat more, leading to bad odors.  Practicing good dental hygiene is the main way to keep your breath smelling fresh. Be sure to brush and floss every day, and see the dentist regularly to take care of issues like plaque buildup so you don't end up with chronic bad breath. In addition to basic hygiene, you can keep your breath smelling good all day long by doing the following:   Drink lots of water. This is especially important during and just after meals. It rinses away the food particles and cleanses your mouth. Use mouthwash - but not the kind with alcohol. Alcohol in mouthwash can dry out your mouth, leading to conditions that cause bad breath. Choose a breath-freshening wash that doesn't have alcohol and rinse your mouth out whenever you're in need of a quick fix. Avoid garlic, onions and super spicy foods on days when you're really concerned about having fresh breath. It's hard to mask the smell of strong-scented foods with mouthwash, and the odor can persist even after brushing or using mouthwash. Carry breath mints you can pop last minute when you want your breath to smell sweet.  

hop in the shower.  use deodorant.  try body powder.  wear clothes that smell good.  have great-smelling feet.  freshen your breath. 

 Put the beans in a large stockpot or Dutch oven and cover them with at least 2 quarts (2 l) of cool tap water.   The water level should be high enough to cover the beans completely. If you suspect that more water is needed, you can add up to an additional 2 quarts To cut the cooking time down by 15 to 30 minutes, add 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of baking soda to the cooking water. Stir gently to dissolve it  , Cook the beans on medium-high heat long enough for the water to begin boiling. Reduce the heat to medium or medium-low so that the water just barely simmers. Cover and cook for 30 minutes  , Give the ingredients a slight mix to incorporate them into the beans. Then, cover and simmer the beans for another 45 to 60 minutes   You could also use 1/4 cup (60 ml) of bacon grease instead of the margarine. If you were to add bacon or salt pork, you would add it now and do so in place of the margarine. The red pepper is only optional, but it does add a hint of kick and flavor to otherwise plain beans. For best results, add the salt during this second round of cooking rather than during the first round. Adding the salt too early could toughen the beans.  Use a fork to test one bean, checking to see if it is tender and cooked through. If so, they are ready to serve.   Cooked beans are also quite fragrant. If the beans are not finished cooking, you can continue letting them simmer for up to 30 more minutes, checking after each period of 10 minutes to determine if the beans are tender yet.  

fill the pot of beans with 2 quarts (2 l) of water.  bring the water to boil before reducing the heat.  add the margarine, salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper.  test the beans for tenderness. 

 There is no harm done to your furniture if you let it fade to a light brown, and eventually to an aged silvery color. If you enjoy this appearance or the low maintenance, just dust your teak furniture regularly, and wash it occasionally if dirt or moss builds up.   During the initial weathering, your teak furniture may look uneven in color or slightly cracked. This should even out over time., You may scrub the furniture with a soft-bristled brush and warm soapy water to temporarily restore a slightly brighter color. Avoid hard bristles or high-pressure hoses, which may damage the teak.  A specialized cleaning product, called teak cleaner, can be used if soap and water is not enough to remove dirt or brighten the furniture's color. There are two major types of teak cleaner available:One part teak cleaner is safe and easy to apply. Scrub it in with a soft-bristled brush, for approximately 15 minutes. Gently rinse with clean water, using an abrasive cleaning pad or bronze wool to open up the pores of the wood and remove the cleaner. Avoid steel wool, which may discolor the teak. Two part teak cleaners are harsher on your teak's lifespan and texture, but operate faster and may dissolve tough grime. Apply the first part, an acid, and wait according to the instructions on the packaging. Scrub in the second part, which neutralizes the acid, making sure to cover the furniture thoroughly.  If your teak furniture is heavily used or kept in an area with energetic activity, you may wish to protect it from stains in advance. A clear, protective sealant can be applied anytime the teak is dry to form a hard layer over the teak's surface. The name and application method of these products vary between brands. Look for "teak protectors" or "clear coat" for teak, and follow the instructions on the packaging.   The use of a sealant and oil at the same time is controversial, as some believe them to have negative effects in combination. Some cleaning product manufacturers, however, recommend both.  One of teak's attractions is its extreme durability, which makes protection usually unnecessary. However, a porous cover such as canvas may make cleaning easier. Never use a plastic or vinyl cover, which traps moisture on the furniture.  Some stains, such as red wine or coffee, may be difficult to remove by washing. Remove the top layer of wood instead with medium-grain sandpaper, then create a smooth surface with fine-grain sandpaper once the stain is gone.This will likely brighten the furniture's appearance where sanded, as the interior of the teak still contains natural oils.  

simply dust occasionally if you enjoy the natural color.  clean the teak furniture instead if you would like to restore its color.  use teak cleaner for more significant cleaning.  apply a clear protective coat to avoid damage.  consider covering the teak when not in use.  lightly sand off stains. 

 Thinking of someone as your "enemy" makes things very black-or-white — it ignores that people are complicated and not simply "good" or "evil." Ask yourself — why do you consider this person an enemy? What have they done or who are they to you that makes them your enemy? Try to view them as people, the same as the you, and shake the good vs. bad label. When someone does something rude or mean, it can help you keep your cool and not take it personally to remember that they're just a person and they are probably taking something out on you.   Developing empathy can help you ditch the black-or-white thinking. Empathy allows you to put yourself in someone else's shoes and try to understand their perspective. If, for example, a classmate is rude to you, instead of taking it personally and getting hurt or mad, you might think, "Our teacher yelled at him earlier today, and I could tell he was embarrassed. Now he's trying to take that out on me. This has to do with him feeling embarrassed and nothing to do with me."; , You can feel more confident standing up to the person if you practice what you are going to say and how you are going to say it.Think about what you are going to say. Write it down if you need to, so that you can get your wording just right. Practice what you want to say at home in the mirror, or even in the bathroom mirror at school, if you need to. For example, you might look in the mirror and say, “I am confident and I can stand up for myself.” You can also ask a friend of yours to practice with you. You could say, “Barbara, will you help me practice what I want to say to Emile?”  , Even if you don’t feel so confident, you can stand up to someone if you act like you are confident. Whenever you are around the person, act as if you are sure of yourself.Take a deep breath or two to calm yourself down. You’ll act more confidently if you’re calm and relaxed. Stand up straight, loosen your shoulders and push them back a bit. Relax your arms and hands. If you are carrying something, then just hold it — don’t grip it like your life depends on it. Hold your head up and look forward and around you when you are walking.Look people in the eyes when you talk to them. Nothing shows confidence more than a great smile. If it helps, think of something funny to make yourself smile. For example, when you are going into the lunchroom and you know someone you don't get along with is there, take a deep breath, hold up your head and smile as you walk through the doors.  When you feel good about yourself you will find it easier to stand up for yourself. So, make sure to do things that improve your self-image and your opinion of yourself.Use positive self-talk. Say things to yourself like, “I’m a great person. I am brave, smart, and people like me. Most important, I like me.” Make a list or a journal entry describing all the good things about you and the things that you can do. For example, you might write, “I’m caring, friendly, and I can play soccer, basketball, and football.”  , Being around your family and friends can give you the courage and support you need to stand up to bullies and advocate for yourself.They can help you feel good about yourself and help you figure out ways to deal with people you don't get along with.   Talk to the people close to you about what is going on. Ask them for suggestions for dealing with it. You could say, “Can I talk to you about someone at school?” Spend time doing things that you enjoy like watching a movie or going for a bike ride. Doing things with people that care about you will improve your mood and self-esteem. If you don’t have time to get together in person, then make the time to call or video chat your friends and family.  If you start yelling and screaming at the person, or get physically violent, you will be giving them the reaction they want.Instead, stand up to the person by talking to them in a calm, confident, controlled voice that lets them know you are serious.   Look the person in the eyes and speak in a clear, assertive voice. You don’t have to sound mean, but you don’t want to sound scared either. For example, if someone calls you a rude name, don’t start yelling rude things back. Instead, look them in the eyes and stay calm. Try saying, “I’m tired of you bothering me at school. I don’t have time for it, so just leave me alone.” Or, you might try, “This is childish. I have better things to do than waste time with you, and I’m sure you do to.”  , The less time you spend around bullies or people you don't get along with, the less time they will have to say something to get on your nerves. You can stand up for yourself if you say what you need to say and then move on.   Don’t give bullies time to say anything bad about you or give you a hard time. Act like you are busy or on the way somewhere when you see them. For example, a bully is coming into class when you are leaving and they say something rude, just say “Whatever” or ignore them and keep walking out of the door. If you feel threatened or like the situation is getting violent or out of hand, you should just leave. Go somewhere where other people are around or that you feel safe.  

reframe your thinking.  practice talking to the person.  act with confidence.  boost your self-esteem.  surround yourself with people that care about you.  stay calm and in control when you talk.  keep your interactions short. 

 Turn the heat up to medium high.; , Cut up a small onion, a small green pepper and 2 celery ribs. Have these waiting so that you can sauté them when the fat is heated.  You will add this after the other chopped vegetables.  (680g) of chicken breasts into 1-inch (2.5cm) pieces. Sprinkle them with salt and pepper and set aside.  Cook the bacon until it has a crispy texture. Remove it with a slotted spoon and place it on several pieces of paper towel.   Add olive oil to the pot, if the bacon did not give up much grease. You want approximately 2 tbsp. (30ml) of fat in the bottom of the stock pot.  sauté them until they soften. This will take approximately 5 minutes.  (680g) of chicken pieces. Also, add 1/2 tsp.

Stir the ingredients until the flour turns a golden brown color.  Scrape the bottom of the pan with the spoon.  (0.7l) of chicken broth to the pot. Also, add a 28 oz. (0.8l) can of whole, diced or crushed tomatoes. Pour in 16 oz. (0.5l) of water.  (1.6g) of crushed red pepper, 2 bay leaves and 1/4 tsp. salt (1.5g). Stir well. ,, Cover the pot.  Check to see if the rice is done after 15 to 20 minutes, by tasting it.  Remove the soup from the heat. Take out the bay leaves. , 

place a large stock pot or dutch oven on the largest burner of your stove range.  chop your vegetables.  mince 2 cloves of garlic.  cut up 1.5 lbs.  slice 3 strips of bacon into small pieces.  place your chopped vegetables in the stock pot.  add your 1.5 lbs.  add your minced garlic.  measure 1/4 cup (31g) of flour.  pour 1 cup (0.2l) of chicken broth into the pot.  add an additional 24 oz.  season the soup with 1/2 tsp.  allow the contents to come to a boil.  ,  measure and add 1 cup (18.5g) of long-grained white rice.  ,  turn the temperature to low or medium-low, depending upon the temperature at which your range simmers.  remove the lid and stir the soup every 5 minutes.  add the bacon bits.  allow it to sit and thicken for 10 minutes before serving.  ,  finished.  

 There are certain specifications for your page design that should not be altered:   Use standard margins, 1 inch (2.54 cm) in from the edges, and 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) hanging indents if any of the character descriptions take up more than 1 line. Do not include a page number on your creative cast page. Set the names of the cast members apart from the rest of the text by capitalizing them or using a bold font.; , Next to the character's name, be sure to include the following information:   Identifying information. This includes, but is not limited to: age, race, physical description and gender. A short write-up of the character's personal back-story. Try to provide a sense of who that character is as a person, what the character's defining personality traits are, etc. Multiple casting designations. Indicate if a character on the cast list is meant to play more than 1 character in the play.    Animated graphics portraying head shots of the cast members is a good way to customize the cast page. These graphics should be placed right next to each coinciding character description. Draw attention to names on the cast list by enlarging or bolding the font, or use a different font altogether. Choose a font for your creative cast page that seems to represent the feel of the play. Just make sure it easy to read.  Again, stay within the tone of the production itself.  

follow standard formatting guidelines.  write catchy character descriptions, in a voice or tone that is reflective of the script's style and mood.  include fonts and graphics as appropriate.  close the cast list off with a short summation of the play's setting(s) and details of the intermission (or lack thereof). 

 Add one cup of sugar to one cup of hot water. This will allow the sugar to dissolve into the water. Let the mixture sit until it is cool enough not to burn the skin.  Dip the cotton into the sugar water and use it to write the message. You may need to dip several times depending on the length of your message. Try to avoid dripping or lingering with the cotton swab on the paper for too long. This will cause the paper to absorb more sugar water in that area and result in a large “spot” on the paper when you show your message., You can do this well with a toaster. Turn the toaster on and hold the paper overtop of the toaster. As the paper gets hot, the sugar will begin to caramelize and form long chains of sugar molecules. These chains absorb light differently than the smaller sugar molecules, and will have brownish color. This browning of the sugar reveals the message you wrote.Do not put the paper in the toaster. It will start a fire. Children should have adult supervision when using this method.  

mix a solution of water and sugar.  use a cotton swab to write your message.  heat the paper. 

 For the ant, sugar is a high-energy food source and allows the ant to work less for the same amount of energy.Therefore, the ant is attracted to anything sugary. This means that it is important to make sure that ants cannot find sugar in your kitchen.   If you spill sugar or something containing sugar, like fruit juice, wipe it up thoroughly and immediately. For sticky messes like juice, a cleaning spray is useful to help lift the mess away and prevent any residue from sticking to kitchen surfaces. A spray made from natural products is ideal because it is safe to use around food.; , Put your sugar and other sweet products into containers that can be tightly sealed, such as plastic containers with airtight lids. This will also help keep your sugar fresh and prevent it hardening!  , After you finish having a meal, do not leave dirty dishes in the sink. The food residue on such items provides an easy meal for ants and is similar to leaving bait out for them. If you must leave dirty dishes around, rinse any leftover food off of the plates.  Any traces of food will draw ants to your kitchen.  Another thing that ants love is crumbs, because they are easy to carry around and take back to the queen. Regularly cleaning your counter tops will remove crumbs. Vacuuming out your pantry and cupboards from time to time will also take care of any bits of food that have escaped their containers.   A hose on your vacuum is useful for hard-to-reach places. This step is especially important if you keep kitchen appliances under the counter, where crumbs can fall out and be easily picked up by ants on the floor.  Otherwise, they accumulate and provide a pile of food for ants.  Ants hate black pepper and will not cross lines of it,which protects your food and appliances. You should also find any cracks in your kitchen, such as around windows, and block them off with pepper.  If you see an ant around, kill it immediately (or try to remove it without killing it, if you prefer) and wipe up the place where you found it. Ants leave invisible trails that other ants can follow.  As a last resort, if you notice ants invading despite your efforts, you can place ant traps in your cupboards and around your counter. Always be wary of using any kind of poisonous trap around your food, and read labels carefully.  

take note that ants adore sweet things.  do not leave bags or other containers that hold sweet things open to ants.  clear things away.  make sure to thoroughly clean out any appliances that you keep out on the counter, such as stand-up mixers.  remove all crumbs.  dump the crumbs out of your toaster regularly.  line the borders of your cupboards with ground black pepper as an extra precaution.  remove the ant and its trail.  use traps.

 Tubas are quite expensive when new, but it shouldn't be too hard to find a used tuba for under 2000 dollars, or even lower. If you’re joining a school band, you can usually rent tubas directly. Most concert tubas are available in a few different pitches, which may be more appropriate for the style of music you plan on playing. You can get tubas pitched in BBb, CC, Eb, and F.Eb tuba is used for brass bands (almost exclusively) and some soloing F tuba is used for passages requiring higher notes and solo works. It is also seen in small ensemble settings (brass quintet, brass quartet, etc) BBb and CC tubas are intended for large ensemble playing (band, orchestra, etc.) BBb tubas are more common at the high school, college, and amateur level as sousaphones are pitched in BBb, but professional orchestra players in the U.S. use CC tubas. In Europe it can vary from country to country.; , Mouthpieces come in different sizes, so be sure to get one that is best suited for you and your size. Generally made of fiberglass or composite metal, a good mouthpiece is essential to a properly tuned and played instrument.   If you buy a used tuba, or rent one, make sure you get your own new mouthpiece. A good quality mouthpiece is important to develop the proper buzzing technique and breath support. A fiberglass mouthpiece is sometimes used as an alternative because temperature doesn't effect its intonation as much as a metal mouthpiece. Fiberglass mouthpieces may work and are more inexpensive but you lose some quality sound and overtones.  Tubas are not generally played standing up, unless you're playing a sousaphone, which is designed for use in a marching band. In order to practice, you'll need a good chair, in which you can maintain proper posture and balance to build the skills that will keep your notes pure.   Get a basic hard-backed chair without any arm wrests, or a stool that you can sit on comfortably. Avoid practicing on the couch, in a recliner, or in otherwise less-than-upright conditions. You can't get the breath-support necessary to play correctly, and you'll build poor habits into your practice routine.  No point in learning the mechanics of the tuba if you can't read the music or apply what you've learned. While it's difficult to learn to play any instrument properly from a book, it's a great way to get the basics down and figure out how to start playing music on the tuba, as well as how to hold and play it properly.   If you're trying to use a computer to aid you, having a projector connected to it is probably the only way it wouldn't be an inconvenience. It's good to get started online, but finding a professional method book is the best way to learn an instrument. Wait to troubleshoot technique issues online after you've got the fundamentals down.  Your back should be straight, and your head should be lifted comfortably so that you're looking straight ahead at the conductor, if there is one, or straight ahead if you're playing alone. Your back should not be touching the back of the chair, your feet flat on the floor., Depending on your height, it may be appropriate to rest the tuba on the chair between your legs or rest it on your lap, gently on the top of your thighs. If it's a full-size tuba, you may want to get a stand to set it on.   It's important to position the tuba in such a way that you will not have to bend yourself to reach the mouthpiece. Bring the horn to you, don't bend to the horn. When you try to fill the horn with air, you'll notice a big difference.  On a right-handed tuba, you'll lean the tuba slightly to the left, using your left hand to support the lean. Place your right hand on the valves, either on the broad part of the pad on a rotary tuba, or with your fingertips on the center of the valves on a valve tuba.   Most tubas have a small ring to put your thumb through. This forces your hand to stay in place and helps give a bit of support from your right hand. Find the ring, if your tuba has one, and position your hand accordingly. On a lefty tuba, you'll be resting the tuba practically on your left leg which is why stands are very important for lefty players. Your right hand has to reach for the valves, but it will also be providing a lot of support. The left hand will keep things balanced.  Let your lap support the tuba, not your arms. Try to relax your shoulders and let your arms hold the tuba loosely. Treat it like your date, not like your wrestling partner. The more comfortably you can move around the horn, the better you'll be able to play.  Remember, this is a big instrument, so your air needs to be big and fast to get the sound out out of the horn. Breath deep down into your diaphragm, not up high in your throat. That air has a long way to go, so start it out from a place of power.   Unless you're playing a Sousaphone in a marching band, the goal is not to blow all of your air reserves through the horn at once, but to keep your diaphragm taunt. If someone were to punch you in the stomach, you should stay tight and not collapse. Tense your abdominal muscles while you play and while you blow., While blowing, close your lips to the point that it vibrates in the mouthpiece. Keep blowing and vibrating your lips so that sound gets out of the tuba. As tuba is a large brass, try blowing a raspberry into the mouthpiece. That's the kind of vibration you are looking at. Once you've got your buzz figured out, start your note by saying either "ta" or "da" into the mouthpiece, depending on how you want to articulate the note.   A properly maintained "embouchure" is critical to playing brass instruments. It's difficult to buzz your lips properly when you're first learning how to play. Don't puff out your cheeks. It's a waste of air that should be going into your horn, it looks silly, and you'll end up with very sore cheeks after only a brief period of playing.  At any given position or configuration of keys pressed and open, you can play a number of notes, usually three. Some beginners have difficulty hitting a note right the first time, but don't worry too much while you're just getting started. Practice feeling where the different registers are.   Pinch your cheeks and your lips as you blow to control the amount of air that comes through your "buzz." You can raise or lower the pitch of the note in the same position, accordingly. Try associating how the note will sound, where the note is on the staff, what it feels like to play the note, and the fingering for it. Many beginners only associate the note on the staff and the fingering for it, so they become confused when playing notes with the same fingering but different mouth positions.  Once you've started to get a feel for the register of the tuba, start experimenting with fingerings. Press the keys and practice doing so in time with the notes that you play. Whether you're studying along with a book or receiving lessons, start practicing fingering the keys fully and playing clear notes with the valves pressed.   Most guide books should come with finger charts, which correspond the fingerings to the specific notes on the scale that you want to play. This is an excellent way to learn to play. Push the valve in the center, not on the rim. Pushing it on the rim can make the valve stuck.  Start learning your fingerings and playing scales to develop the fundamentals to start playing music.Scales might not be the most exciting thing to learn when you're first getting started, but before you know it you'll be able to hit all the right ones to play the "Imperial March" from Star Wars (the "Stairway to Heaven" of the tuba) and take off from there.  The tuba is both a rhythmic and a melodic instrument, providing the big, sturdy, bottom line of the band. To be the best tuba player you can be, it's important to practice playing rhythmically, so you play not only the right notes, but the right notes at the right time. Great tuba players are as rhythmically precise as a drummer and as melodically clear as a trumpet player.   Practice with a metronome. Even when you're playing scales, play them in time. When you're playing your practice songs, play them in time. Learn to internalize that sense of time by tapping your feet and paying close attention to your rhythmic motion. Practice your counting. Sometimes, tuba notes will be spaced out very far, meaning that you'll mostly be counting empty measures on some songs. Develop a good method for counting rests to make sure you're always on time for your big notes.  Tuba is a much better instrument when you play it with others. Sometimes, the sheet music for a song on tuba involves only a few notes, which you can learn quickly and get bored with just as fast. But when you add the trumpets and the trombones, the flutes and the clarinets, those few notes become so much more. You're making music.   Consider taking private lessons as well. Like most instruments, learning a tuba properly usually requires in-person instruction. Whether you receive that in school band or in private lessons, getting one-on-one instruction is a good way of keeping you from building bad habits and moving forward with your playing. Explore good instructors available in your area and sign up.  These slightly more advanced techniques are useful for playing fast passages, when you're called for. While this isn't something that you need to start learning when you're first getting to know your way around the tuba, developing the clarity, tone, and speed of your notes can be helped with learning to tongue quickly.   When double tonguing, think either ta-ka-ta-ka or da-ga-da-ga. Try saying it first, and when you try double tonguing, think as if your tongue is moving in one of the two ways described above. Triple tonguing has four approaches: Ta-ta-ka, ta-ka-ta, da-da-ga, or da-ga-da. Try all, and choose the one that works best on you and stick with it.  A tuba isn't as delicate as say, a violin, but it is still quite prone to denting and scratching. Always transport your instrument in a case and learn to maintain your tuba to get the best possible sound.   Empty the water that is in your tuba frequently by pushing the water key and blowing air into the instrument without vibrating your lips. Check individual valves by pressing down each one in turn and blowing; if there's any water in the tubing, it should sound and feel obvious. You may need to remove the tubing or rotate the tuba to clear everything. Find somewhere for tuba repairs. Professional instrument repairmen might charge you a pretty penny for fixing things, but they know what they're doing and it's better than ruining a giant investment by messing with something you don't understand.  

make sure the tuba fits your body.  use a mouthpiece of the correct size.  find an appropriate chair.  get a method book.  sit on the edge of your seat and be relaxed.  rest the tuba on your lap.  use the correct hand positioning.  relax your shoulders.  breathe from your diaphragm.  buzz your lips.  practice changing notes without pressing the valves.  press the keys properly.  practice scales.  practice your timing.  join the school band or a community orchestra.  learn double and triple tonguing.  care for your tuba properly. 

 Changing doctors is a serious decision. Sometimes, the decision to switch is out of necessity. For example, if you or your doctor is moving out of the area, then it may be necessary to find a new doctor. Unfortunately, sometimes negligence or poor performance on behalf of your current doctor may prompt the desire to switch. You should consider finding a new doctor if any of the following occur:   The doctor dismisses your complaints, especially if you're older. Elderly patients frequently have doctors who overlook or ignore ailments by simply blaming age.The doctor orders tests or lab work without explaining their reasons.Your doctor interrupts you frequently and does not interact with you for very long during office visits.Your doctor prescribes medication or orders surgeries and procedures without knowing your medical history or with little prior discussionIf your doctor has been involved in any medical malpractice allegations, it might be a good idea to switch. If you have a specific condition, and your doctor is not a specialist in that area, you need to find a new doctor.; , When switching doctors, you need to decide whether your reasons for leaving are worth explaining.   If you're leaving your doctor because you were unhappy with his or her services, it's okay to express this. Doctors do like to keep patients happy and their reputation intact, so feedback may help their performance in the future. However, many people are not comfortable with face-to-face confrontation. You could consider writing a letter and mailing it to your doctor's office.If you feel uncomfortable with your current doctor for any reason, it is acceptable to leave without explanation. Doctors are generally busy and may not notice a missing patient, especially if your visits are infrequent., Sometimes, switching doctors is not a result of a bad relationship between doctor and patient. If you and your doctor are on good terms, there's no better source to ask for a referral to a new physician than your former doctor.   Chances are your doctor has a colleague in the area that will make a good replacement. Medical schools are wide-reaching communities and physicians often end up with a nation-wide list of references. Even if you are switching due to a big move, your doctor could still help. As your doctor already knows your medical history, he or she can help you search for a new physician who can cater to your specific needs. In fact, your doctor may actually suggest you transfer to a specialist if they're having trouble with your particular condition., Seek out the advice of people you trust, like friends and family members, as you begin your search for a new physician.   Ask friends and family members a variety of questions. Ask if they know a good doctor, whether they'd recommend their current doctor, how long it takes to get an appointment, what the waiting time is like, and how long their doctor generally spends with patients.If you're seeing any health care specialists, like an allergy doctor or dermatologist, you could also ask one of them for suggestions. A specialist doctor might be able to refer you to a friend or a colleague., There are a variety of ways to find a doctor through online searches. This can be especially helpful if you're new to the area and do not know anyone who you could ask.   The American Medical Association has a doctor finder tool. Not only can you find doctors in your area who specialize in certain fields, you can also get a sense of a doctor's reputation. Information on medical malpractice records and overall patient satisfaction is available.You can also search online using your insurance provider. They generally have a list of doctors that take your insurance, and you can search by field and location.The Affordable Healthcare Act has a list of providers online. Other websites like healthfinder.gov, also have databases of physicians.Physician rating sites, such as Healthgrades, can be a hit and miss tool for gauging a doctor's competence. People often only post if they loved or hated a doctor, so opinions are often biased or given in response to temporary frustrations., Once you have found a doctor you think might be right for you, you should schedule an appointment as soon as possible. There, you can discuss your medical history and specific needs with your new physician.   When you call to schedule an appointment, have a variety of questions ready. Ask how long an appointment typically takes, how long lab work and x-rays take to process, whether your doctor is board certified, and who sees patients if your doctor is out of town.You will probably be asked to come in 15 to 20 minutes early to fill out forms. Make sure you know your medical history thoroughly before going in and have a list of all your current medications and their dosages. You will also be asked about any drug allergies, or serious reactions to drugs, so make sure you have this information as well.The doctor will ask you about your family's medical history. Do a mental recap before going in of any major illnesses or ailments, like cancer and heart attacks, in your family's history., After your first appointment, you need to consider whether this doctor is right for you. If not, then you can continue to look elsewhere.   Be honest with yourself. Were you comfortable at the doctor's office? Did your new doctor repeat any mistakes your old doctor made? You don't want to switch over and end up with the same set of problems. If you weren't happy with your experience, keep looking. Was your new doctor able to help you with your specific medical issues? If the new doctor's area of expertise does not apply to your situation, you might want to keep looking. Was the doctor courteous and respectful during your visit? Poor bedside manner is a reason many people give for switching doctors. Go over the conversation you had with your new doctor and determine whether anything said made you uncomfortable or hurt your feelings. Yet again, you don't want a repeat of past issues.  Healthcare can get very costly without insurance. Make sure your doctor accepts your insurance plan.   You can call the office and ask or you can check online. Oftentimes, you can even find doctors through working with your insurance company. This is a great way to assure your coverage is accepted. If you have any questions about coverage and co-pays, clear these up with your insurance company before going in. You don't want to get a big bill you were not anticipating a month after your first visit.  You'll need your medical records forwarded to your new doctor. This can be done in a variety of ways.   You can request a copy of your medical records over the phone, and some offices even have a Patient Portal that allows you to access your records online. You can have the records sent directly to you and then bring them to your new doctor. Make sure to request items like lab results, x-rays, and any CAT or MRI scans.If you're being referred to a specialist, consultation notes can help your new doctor understand your condition. While these legally belong to your doctor, you're entitled to a copy. You can request these when requesting your records.You can request your records face-to-face at the front desk of your doctor's office. You may be required to pay for the cost of print outs, but the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act means you can only be charge cost-based fees. In general, if there is a fee it's around $20. If you have a lengthy medical record, you may have to pay more., Preparing your own patient history can help smooth the transition. You should also make sure there's no gaps in coverage. You don't want to be left without a doctor during an emergency or run out of a prescription and have no one to refill it.   Make sure that you get a supply of refills for any prescriptions you have with your old doctor before searching for a new one. This way, you won't be left without your meds if the search is lengthy and your prescription expires.Make a running list of your medical history, including medications, allergies, and diseases that run in your family, and give a copy to your new doctor. New patient forms are often brief and it's difficult to include all the necessary information. The more your doctor knows about you, the better. 

know when to switch.  decide what to tell your former doctor, if anything.  ask your former doctor for a referral.  ask around.  search online.  schedule your first appointment.  evaluate your experience.  make sure the new doctor will take your insurance.  have your medical records forwarded.  get organized. 

 If you are already in a relationship with the target girl, then you should be sure to keep the stream of compliments flowing. Don’t take it for granted that she knows you consider her pretty. She will appreciate hearing it every now and then – and the more the better.   “You are so beautiful/cute/pretty/lovely” will always work. Or, alternately, call he a goddess or say something like, “You are as pretty as you are smart.” Focus on different outfits, as well. When your girlfriend wears a new outfit, tell her how good she looks in it.  Think of different ways to compliment your girlfriend once a day. When you are in a relationship, simply telling your girlfriend she is pretty may grow stale. Fortunately, there are a number of other ways to pay her compliments.   Compliment her on looks, but also on her personality, her dress, her scent, and her grooming. Trying saying in you next conversation, “You are right! You’re so smart.” Try more general complements that reflect how happy you are with her, like “I so lucky to have a pretty girl like you” or "You make me so happy.” Compliment her in new and different ways. Try making her a playlist of songs that have meaning for the two of you, for example.  Words go even better with gestures. Every once and a while, for instance, bring your girlfriend a random gift to back up all the compliments you have been paying her. She will remember your thoughtfulness.   You can try also leaving a note, sending her a random text message and/or posting a comment on her facebook or instagram page, or calling her unexpectedly. Use your imagination.  

keep those compliments coming.  be creative.  back up your words with actions. 

 Start with your primary care doctor who can initiate an evaluation with blood work, imaging, and a trial of some medications and refer you to the right specialist. Let your physician know if you have a history of addiction, as you may be at higher risk for addiction to painkillers.If your pain is due to the aftereffects of cancer treatments, talk to your oncologist. Pain specialists and oncologists have the most experience dealing with the many complex issues surrounding the treatment of pain.; , The first step in the medical management of pain is to determine the cause of the pain. The pain may be from disorders such as arthritis, fibromyalgia, cancer, and more. It might take additional studies, evaluation, and time to find the source. Once the underlying cause is determined, then treatment can be discussed.You may need to see a number of different doctors, including a rheumatologist, orthopedic, neurologist, and/or physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist.  After you determine the cause of your pain, you and your doctor can discuss the use of medication. In general, acetaminophen (Tylenol) or NSAIDs (Aleve, Advil, aspirin) are used first. The idea is to start first with medications with the fewest side effects.For all these pain medications, it is very important to follow the instructions exactly as written. If the instructions are not clear, make sure you ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist to explain them until you are very clear on when and how to take the medication. Report any side effects or problems with the medications right away.   Under some circumstances, tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline may be used to control pain. A third class of drugs that may be used are the Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as duloxetine (Cymbalta). Corticosteroids are primarily used for inflammatory rheumatology and autoimmune disorders. Sometimes a short course is ordered to treat acute pain as well. Anticonvulsants such as gabapentin (Neurontin) or pregabalin (Lyrica) have been shown to be useful for some types of nerve pain, including fibromyalgia and neuropathies. Opiates are generally reserved for pain that doesn’t respond to other pain medications. They should be used only for a short period of time and/or after you and your doctor develop careful treatment plan, as opiates are highly addictive.  It is very important to be aware of and stick to the dosage recommended by your physician to minimize the chances of developing a problematic tolerance to the pain medication. Tolerance is defined as “a phenomenon or adaptation of the body over a period of time in which one or more effects of a drug become less with repeated use at the same dose.” This is often referred to as becoming “immune” to the action of the drug.It is important to understand that tolerance is not addiction. Tolerance is the body’s adaptation to the drug. The problem with tolerance is that more and more drugs are needed to achieve the same effect, and increasing doses also means there is an increased risk of dangerous or unacceptable side effects and the chance of an accidental overdose. Following the dosage schedule can slow down the tolerance process.  More and more pain management programs are interdisciplinary and utilize many different professionals with a wide diversity of skill sets that can help you deal with chronic pain in the healthiest way possible, improving your quality of life as much as possible.This team first includes you. The pain management team can also include a physician and nurses, in addition to physical, massage, occupational, recreational, and psychological therapists. There may also be social workers, nutritionists and other support staff. The important thing for you to remember is to access the team and make use of the services they have to offer you.  You should consider including a physical therapist as part of your pain management team. A physical therapist can help you manage pain by giving you bodily treatments catered towards relieving your pain. These exercises include strengthening exercises, flexibility exercises, manual therapy, posture help, and body mechanics instruction. 

talk to your doctor.  determine the cause of the pain.  decide on a medication.  follow medical dosage instructions.  work with your pain management team.  get physical therapy. 

 If you don't know exactly what it was you did wrong or how you can rebuild a feeling of trust, getting your things back can be difficult. Although it can be tough, talking with your parents about the problem can be the best way forward. After you learn what the problem is by sharing your thoughts and feelings, you can take direct steps to rebuild trust and get your things back.Don't be afraid to ask your parents why you are in trouble. Say something like "I understand that I did something wrong, but I'm not sure what exactly is wrong with it." It's okay to share your side of things with your parents and honestly talk about how you feel. Having an honest and civil discussion with your parents can be a great first step to show maturity and rebuild trust. Even if your parents are mad, avoid yelling at them or speaking with any kind of sarcastic tone. Showing an understanding of what you did wrong and how it affected trust between you and your parents can be a good idea. You could say something like "I know that sneaking out last night was wrong and dangerous. I'm sorry for doing it and I want to help make things better."  , If you don't feel like there is a clear way forward, rebuilding trust can seem impossible. Knowing exactly what you can expect from your good behavior can help you know how to act, what to do, and how you can get your stuff back. Ask your parents for some details about when and how you can have your privileges back.  Ask your parents what behavior they expect from you in the future. You might say "I want make up for what I did. What can I do to show that?" Ask your parents when you can expect your things or privileges restored. Try asking something like "How long can I expect to wait before I get my things back?"  , It can be pretty obvious when you've done something to make your parents upset. However, this doesn't always make it easier when you're trying to do what's right. Asking your parents to let you know when your doing the right thing can help rebuild trust and demonstrate that you are trying to make things right.You could ask your parents something like "I want to do the right thing and apologize for what I did. It would be nice to hear when I do the right thing. I think this will help me focus on what to do next time."  , Restoring trust between you and your parents won't happen overnight. Anytime trust is broken, it will take some time before it is restored. Don't be in a rush to rebuild trust and get your stuff back faster. For now, focus on doing the right thing in the future and avoid doing anything that might make the situation worse. 

talk to your parents.  have your parents make their expectations clear.  ask for some positive feedback.  take your time. 

 To determine if your book is worth publishing, you should read it over yourself with a critical eye. Note if the plot of the book is strong and engaging. If your book is fiction, you may look at how the plot unfolds in the book and whether it is compelling for a reader. If your book is non-fiction, you may consider how your approach to the subject matter keeps the reader engaged and wanting to turn the page.Ask yourself, If I were a reader, would I be engaged by this book? Would I be compelled to finish this book? Though it can be difficult to critique your own work, try to be honest when you answer these questions. Be willing to adjust your book if the answers to these questions are “no,” as this will only make your book stronger.  You should also ask yourself if your book has characters that are unique, detailed, and interesting for readers. You should consider if your characters are nuanced and detailed, with a strong voice or point of view. These are often signs of a strong book that is worth being published.Whether your book is fiction, non-fiction, or a collection of poems, you will have characters or speakers in your work. Try to read your book from the perspective of a reader and think about whether the characters or speakers in your book will draw your reader in.  You should also consider if your book feels unique compared to other books in the genre. Ask yourself, What is the book’s unique take or angle? How does it distinguish itself from other books in the genre? Considering these questions will help you determine if your book has an angle that will feel fresh and original to publishers as well as readers.

Be sure to keep the beans covered with water while cooking. Add additional water to the pot if necessary to keep the beans covered.  Once the beans are tender, remove the pot from the stove. Season with salt and pepper, if desired. Serve the beans by themselves, or as a side dish. 

rinse the beans.  put the beans and water in a pot.  cook the beans.  serve the beans. 

 To begin the installation process, put the San Andreas installation CD in your computer. Most of the time, this will cause an autorun window prompting you to begin the installation process to appear immediately.   San Andreas is a decade-old game and, as such, has relatively low system requirements. Most modern computers should be powerful enough to run it. However, if you're not sure of your computer's suitability, consult Rockstar Games' official system requirements for San Andreas.; , For a number of reasons (for instance, because the game isn't designed for modern hardware), it's possible that the autorun prompt won't immediately launch when you insert the San Andreas CD. If it doesn't, try opening the game disc via "My Computer" and running the executable (.exe) install file.  Follow the installation wizard's prompts as directed. Eventually, you'll be asked to specify a location to install the game in. The vast majority of users will want to go with the default location, but if you'd like to install the game elsewhere, specify your desired file location in the text box.  Eventually, you will be asked to choose whether you want a "complete" or "custom" installation. Most users will want the pre-selected "complete" option, as it's simpler and easier. However, if you'd like to save disc space by choosing which specific game components you'd like to install, choose "custom" and follow the additional instructions.  When you've finalized your installation choices, the game will begin to install. This process can take several minutes to complete.  Once the installation has completed, you should be able to play your game. Insert the "Play" CD and begin playing your game via the onscreen Autorun menu that should appear.   If the autorun doesn't appear, try manually running the game's .exe file with the disc inserted.  As noted above, San Andreas is a fairly old game. Because of this, you may experience difficulty getting the game to run even after a successful installation. If you're having trouble, try visiting Rockstar Games' support forumsfor help.  

insert the gta: san andreas cd into your computer's cd drive.  if the autorun window doesn't display, open the install file manually.  choose a directory in which to install the game.  choose between "complete" and "custom" install types.  wait for the game to install.  after the installation is ready, insert the ”play” cd.  consult rockstar games' online troubleshooting resources if you can't get your copy of the game to run. 

 Start small and face your fears gradually. Look online for images and videos of people and dogs playing. Look for cute pictures of puppies, people cuddling with their dogs, and other positive imagery.Try looking for books at your local library. For example, the American Kennel Club’s The Complete Dog Book is a good start.Say to yourself, “I had one negative experience, but I can have positive experiences with dogs in the future. It is possible and probable that I will interact with dogs free of fear and worry.”  , Think of a trusted friend or family member who owns a dog. Try to find someone who owns a smaller, less intimidating breed (unless you find smaller dogs provoke more anxiety). Have them keep their dog leashed in the same room as you.When overcoming a fear or phobia, it’s important that you retain a sense of control. Do the exercise wherever you feel most comfortable, whether it’s at your loved one’s home, your home, or a neutral location. Keep the interaction to a minimum at first. Just spend a half hour or so in the same room as a dog once a week.  Over time, decrease the distance you keep between you and your loved one’s dog. Try to move a few feet closer each time you meet them.Eventually, try to get to the point where you can hold your hand close to the dog and allow it to sniff you. Let it smell your hand and get to know you, then gently pet the dog. If your friend has a treat handy, try offering it a treat or giving it a command, like “Sit.”  

look at pictures and videos of people interacting with dogs.  have a friend or family member bring their dog around you.  increase your confidence level until you’re able to touch the dog. 

 Pessimism is the orientation toward life of expecting that things will go poorly. Usually, people become pessimistic because things in their lives actually did go badly.Pessimistic people often seem negative because they are quick to shoot down ideas and possibilities. Just remember that these people most likely have a history of bad things happening in their lives, so from their perspective, pessimism might seem totally reasonable.   People who have pessimistic views may see positive thinking as "sticking your head in the sand" or refusing to acknowledge life's problems. You can help encourage your friend learn to think more positively by modeling healthy positive thinking in your interactions.For example, a friend with a pessimistic view may say, "I shouldn't even try for that interview, because I'll never get the job." Someone who is refusing to acknowledge reality might respond, "Oh, you'll definitely get the job! There's no way you're not the best!" While this may sound positive, it isn't helpful because it's clearly unrealistic and doesn't acknowledge your friend's genuine concerns. Instead, be positive but realistic: "Okay, maybe you might not be the most qualified person in the world for that job...but you won't know if you can get it unless you apply. You do have a lot of the qualities they're looking for. What would it hurt to apply?"  , Depression is a mood disorder marked by symptoms such as feeling hopeless, an inability to feel pleasure, and extended fatigue. Depression is the source of a lot of negativity; understanding it will help you understand negative friends who may be depressed. Depression is caused by a lot of different factors outside the control of the person, such as genes, family environment, and peer environment. People who feel depressed have difficulty mustering the energy to do things. Because of how tired and “low down” depressed people feel, they may seem really negative and unhappy.People with major depression can't just "snap out" of feeling bad. However, depression is very treatable with therapy and medication. Other symptoms of depression include: frequent feelings of sadness or teariness, angry outbursts, lack of interest in things you used to enjoy, changes to weight, sleep, or appetite, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and frequent thoughts of harm to self or death., Depression is a serious condition that makes it hard for people to connect emotionally and live a happy, healthy life. You can't "fix" your friend's depression, but if you've noticed signs that worry you, talking to her can be a good way to show you care and encourage her to get help.Frame your talk with "I"-statements, such as "Lately I've noticed you don't want to hang out as much. I'm worried about you. Would you like to talk?" Ask questions. Don't assume you know what's going on. Instead, ask your friend some questions, such as "Have you been feeling this way for awhile? Did something happen to make you feel this way?" Offer support. You should let your friend know that you care about her and are there to support her. Often, people with depression feel very bad or worthless about themselves. Let her know that you care for her and are there for her by saying something like, "I really value our friendship. Even if you don't want to talk right now, I'm always here for a chat if you want." People with depression may respond with anger or irritation to your attempt to help. Don't take it personally, and don't try to force the issue., Anxiety can cause frustration and irritability. People with anxiety may feel powerless in their own lives, or terrified of things that don't seem scary to others. They may spend so much time worrying about the fear that they have trouble thinking or concentrating on anything else.People who experience a lot of anxiety may be snappy and lash out more than people who don’t, creating a lot of negative emotional energy in their lives.   If your friend constantly seems to worry about things or feel "out of control" of her own life, she may be experiencing anxiety issues. Like depression, anxiety is a mental disorder that is serious but can be treated. You can't "fix" your friend's anxiety, but you can show her that you care about her and want to support her.  Many people with anxiety feel bad about their inability to control their worrying, which paradoxically leads to more worry. They may feel that seeking treatment is a sign of weakness or that they're "broken." Encourage your friend by reminding her that seeking treatment is actually a sign of strength and self-care.Use "I"-statements when you talk to your friend about her anxiety. Don't make her feel worse about herself by saying things like "You need to work on your anxiety." Instead, say something reassuring and kind, like "I feel like you've been really worried and stressed out the last several times we've spent time together. Are you okay?"  , Many times, people who feel insecure or inadequate have a difficult time being positive and responding well to positive events.This can feel like an act of self-protection, since they are suspicious of being rejected or hurt more. As misguided as it may be, understanding the logic behind it can be useful in dealing with it. You can help build your friend's self-esteem in several ways:Give her positive feedback. Overcoming that self-protective instinct takes time. Whenever you see even the slightest hint of growth, tell your friend something positive about it. For example, "I'm so glad you decided to come out to the bowling alley with us today! I've really missed you." Encourage her. Overcoming negativity is hard work, and she will have relapses. Keep encouraging her to try new tactics. Listen to her. Many people may feel low self-esteem because they feel others don't listen or care about them. Take the time to listen to your friend, acknowledge her concerns, and share your ideas with her. This will make her feel involved in your life, and let her know that she's important to you.  Negativity, whether it’s coming from depression, pessimism, anxiety, insecurity, or something else, is something that no one has complete control over. There are steps people can take to reduce negativity in their lives, but judging someone for being negative can sometimes just make things worse.   Remember that you can't "fix" your friend's problems. However, you can be there to support her. Just remember to take care of yourself, too.  

recognize pessimism.  look for signs of depression.  talk to your friend about depression.  watch for signs of anxiety.  encourage your friend to seek treatment for anxiety.  get a grasp on insecurity and self-esteem.  realize that negativity is partly unconscious.we tend to think of negative behavior as a choice, but it’s more complicated than that. 

 Pluck the strings at the fingerboard. The highest note is E. The lowest is G. The second lowest is D and the second highest is A.    Put rosin on it. Make sure to scratch newly bought rosin with sandpaper, a key, or a coin so it's no longer smooth. You will need to rosin your bow about every time you practice. After practicing, make sure to wipe your violin with a clean cloth to get rid of any sticking rosin.  Make sure your wrist is straight, not flat. Remember, "no pancake hands! Make your wrist straight as a carrot!" Flex your fingers and touch the strings. Put the chin rest under your jaw and align the violin with your arm. Don't put the violin right on your arm, a bit beside it.  Put your thumb just next to the frog. Place your middle and ring finger together on the frog. Make sure they don't go around the frog. Your pointing finger should rest on its side at the second knuckle about four centimeters above your middle finger. Lastly, place your pinky finger next to the scroll. Always remember that your pinky should not go around the bow; it's the only finger that stays on top.  It might also be beneficial to place your fingers near the balance point of the bow. To do this, lay out your middle finger (since it has the most balance) and place the bow on it. Move the bow to the right or left until it stays on your finger without falling off. Then put all of your fingers in place - your finger positioning stays the same, you are just placing your hand in a different place.  Be sure that your bow stick is parallel to the bridge. Start with E, the string closest to your right. E is the highest string. Rest the bow on the E string and start at the bottom of the bow. Put the hair on the string and slowly pull the bow down. Flex from your elbow.   Remember not to put pressure on your hand; use the weight of your arm to pull the bow.  The key is to know where to put your fingers. Put your finger right at the edge of the fingerboard. It's an F. Move it down one fingertip. That should be where you put your first finger.  Many violin teachers mark the spot so that you always know where to put your finger, although you will get into the habit of looking at your fingers and not relying on your ears.  Start right beside your first finger and move it down one finger tape. Mark this with tape as well. This note is a G. Play.  Move it down only half a fingertip. Mark this as well. It is an A. Play this note.  It is the second highest. It is called the A string. Play this. Now. You should already have the tape marking where all the notes are. No fingers is A. First finger is B. Second finger is C. Third finger is D.  Open string: D. First finger: E. Second Finger: F. Third Finger: G.  Guess the next note. If you guessed G, then you're right. The notes on the G string in ascending order are: G, A, B and C.  Keep practicing and use the help of a teacher. 

study the violin.  tighten the bow by twisting the scroll located just below the frog.  put your left thumb and four fingers on the neck at the top of the violin.  hold the bow correctly.  hold the bow gently but firmly.  once you have reached the tip of the bow, put your first finger down.  it's your decision if you want to mark the spot or not.  do the same thing, but this time placing your second finger.  place your third finger right beside the second finger.  now move to the next string on the left.  the next string is the d string.  do you see a pattern in the strings?,  good luck! 

 Once a week, check your Rough Collie’s ears for redness or signs of infection (e.g. discharge or odor). If you see waxiness or dirt inside of the ear, clean it carefully. Brace your dog’s ear gently and wipe the inside of it with a wet cotton cloth.Contact your veterinarian immediately if you see signs of infection.  Gently pull back your dog’s lips to reveal its teeth. Remove any visible plaque or tartar with a dental scraper (available at pet stores) or with your fingernail. Gently brush your dog's teeth, or feed it a dental treat. If any signs of irritation or infection are evident (e.g. redness, swelling, or strong odor), bring your dog to the vet for a complete dental check up to rule out any serious issues.  While many dog owners prefer to have their pet’s nails trimmed at the groomer’s, or by a veterinarian during a routine check up, it is possible to trim your dog’s nails on your own. With your dog laying on its side, brace its paw and look for the quick, a pink vein attached to the nail bed. Using dog clippers (available at pet stores), clip the nail as much as you can without hitting the vein. Pet and praise your dog throughout the process.If you do hit the vein, stop the bleeding by dabbing the nail into a bar of soap.  

clean its ears.  clean its teeth.  trim your dog’s nails. 

 To effectively resolve an issue with a spoiled brat, you first need to take a deep breath and get control of your emotions. You may start to get angry or annoyed at this point, but it is key that you try to act like the reasonable, calm one in the situation. Doing this will allow you to effectively work through the conflict with the spoiled brat and not let your temper get in the way.Don’t take anything the spoiled brat says personally. Often, in the heat of the moment, hurtful things can be said. Your spoiled child may scream and yell “no” at you or a spoiled friend may publicly call you out and say hurtful things to you. Remember that the spoiled person is acting in a rage and out of her own self-interest. You end up being the punching bag she uses to try to get her way and what she is saying has nothing to do with you as a person.; , If you feel you need time to get control of your emotions, do not be afraid to step away and take a timeout. A timeout can be really useful if you are feeling stressed, angry, or frustrated with the spoiled person.You may tell the person you are not emotionally ready to discuss the conflict and that you need some time to yourself. Or, you may instruct a spoiled child to stay in her room for ten to fifteen minutes while you take some time to process the conflict. Giving yourself time to check your emotions will allow you to deal better with the conflict.  Avoid using shame or embarrassment as a discipline tactic, as this could only lead to more conflicts and issues in the future. Instead, try to set up a private meeting with the person to discuss her behavior or take your child into a private setting to talk her about the issue. This will allow you to have a one on one conversation with the person and teach her the consequences of her actions.For example, maybe the spoiled person talks to your partner rudely and calls them inappropriate names. You may then pull the person aside and explain that by doing that, she hurt your partner’s feelings and disrespected both you and your partner. You may then ask her to apologize for her behavior. Having a private discussion will allow you to let the person know that she did something wrong and resolve it together.  You should try to present several options or ways to compromise when you address the conflict with the person. You should use specific suggestions and ways you can both work out the issue. But this does not mean you should negotiate or apologize to the person, as she is responsible for her own spoiled actions. Instead, you should offer several solutions to keep the conversation open and fair.For example, maybe your spoiled child decides not to eat her dinner. You may then present several solutions, such as having her eat at least five bites of her food or having her go to bed hungry. Chances are, she may take the first option as she may not like going to bed on an empty stomach.  One way to avoid conflicts and issues when you are dealing with a spoiled brat is to make sure you have clear rules and boundaries in place. The spoiled brat should be aware of the rules and boundaries so she knows when she is overstepping them. This could be a simple rule, like always saying please and thank you after receiving something from someone, or always saying excuse when you sneeze. You should teach the spoiled brat that she must follow rules and boundaries laid out by you, as this will help you establish limitations around her behavior.You may establish table manner rules early on, such as saying “please” and “thank you”, no elbows on the table, chewing with your mouth closed, and excusing yourself from the table. Enforcing these manners can help the spoiled brat to remain calm and collected at the table. You may have other rules for going out in public, like holding hands in a crowded area so she does not run off or ensuring she comes to you when her name is called. You may also teach her that there are consequences if she acts like a spoiled brat in public, as this could dissuade her from acting out. If you are dealing with a spoiled adult, you should also be direct about your boundaries and limitations. You may let the person know you are not available to take her calls or messages every hour of the day and that you strive to maintain clear boundaries in your life. Being clear and direct can help to prevent issues in the future.  You should have a set schedule of events and activities planned for your child so she knows what to expect and is not confused or thrown off. A change in her routine could lead to a temper tantrum and cause her to act out.You should try to follow the same daily routine for your child, such as waking her up at the same time every day and planning recreational activities on the same days of the week. You may also want to let her know in advance that there will be a change in her routine so she is not surprised or freaked out by it. She may be triggered by the change, regardless, but at least you can say you warned her before it occurs.  It can be easy to ignore moments when your child is playing quietly on her own or getting along with her siblings in public and only focus on the moments when she is acting out. But you should go out of your way to acknowledge and reward any good behavior your “spoiled brat” displays.You may reward her with kind words, taking a moment to say to her, “I appreciate how you are playing well with your sisters”, or “You’re doing a great job staying quiet and calm”. You may also reward her by treating her to a special outing or a fun activity you can both do together.  Instruct your child to use “I” statements to express her emotions and feelings so she can communicate clearly with you and others. Have her practice “I” statements with you and encourage to use “I” statements with she interacts with other adults and kids.If your child is not speaking yet, you can have her learn baby sign language to express herself. You may teach her to use a certain action to express what she wants, such as hunger, attention, or sleep.  Though you should pick your battles with a spoiled brat and avoid responding every time she freaks out, you should also be willing to say “no”. You may try other tactics to distract her or get her focused on something else, but to no avail. If this is the case, you may need to be strict and tell her “no”. Do this firmly and clearly. Then, take away the item she is fighting you over or remove her from the space so she can cry it out in private., To make it less likely that your child will act like a spoiled brat, you should try to recognize any triggers she may have that can lead to bad behavior. Your child may be triggered by being around other children who act spoiled and disrespectful, or by being left alone in an unfamiliar space.Some triggers may be physical, such as hunger, where your child is over-tired and underfed. Your child may also have a medical condition, such as allergies, that can lead to grumpiness and a temper tantrum.  Make sure your child gets enough sleep, and has snacks throughout the day so she is not hungry. You should also avoid areas or spaces that may trigger your child’s medical condition, as this could lead to a conflict or issue.You may also have your child observe and comment on her own behavior so she can learn how to resolve her own issues. This could encourage her to be more willing to address her own bad behaviors and get over being spoiled. For example, you may point out that your child tends to come home from school after a bad day and take out her anger on her little brother. Ask your child, “What can you do instead of pick a fight with your brother?” Your child may then come up with her own solutions to the issue, such as “Maybe I can spend some time alone in my room drawing and listening to music.”  , Spoiled brats need to learn that their behavior has consequences. Being overly protective prevents them from growing and maturing. Everyone needs to learn how to handle difficult situations and take responsibility. Especially spoiled brats.Don’t rescue the person from every uncomfortable situation. Allow the person to occasionally make mistakes.  You can help teach a person patience and gratitude by allowing her to work towards specific goals and rewards by herself. You don’t have to offer encouragement or a reward for everything a person does. Getting the person everything she requests will only spoil the person.Only reward good behavior and don’t agree to every request your child makes.  

stay in control of your emotions during a conflict.  take a timeout if the conflict gets out of hand.  punish the person in private.  present several solutions to an issue or problem.  establish clear rules and boundaries right away.  stick to a daily routine or schedule.  acknowledge and reward good behavior.  encourage good communication.  do not be afraid to say “no” when necessary.  acknowledge any triggers for bad behavior.  try to plan for these triggers so you can avoid them.  avoid being overly protective.  let the person earn her rewards. 

 For example, Ebay. Online trading sites are probably the easiest places to buy trade tokens. For eBay, the following considerations hold when hunting the site for trade tokens:   Most United States trade tokens are listed in Coins and Paper Money/Exonumia/US Trade but there are many different categories of tokens listed under Exonumia including: Civil War tokens, Hard Times tokens, Transit tokens, Good Luck tokens, So-Called Dollars, Love tokens, Tax tokens, etc. Some of these US tokens are trade tokens which circulated during a certain period of time. For, example Hard times Tokens were merchant tokens and patriotic tokens which circulated in the 1830s and 1840s and were the size of a large cent. Civil War tokens were patriotic or store card tokens which circulated during the civil war. Good Luck tokens were often issued by merchants and had good luck symbols. Exonumia isn't the only place where you can buy tokens on eBay. Military tokens are sometimes listed under Exonumia, but many of them are listed under Militaria. So, a lot depends on the type of token you are collecting. If you collect World's Fair tokens - some of these are listed under Historical Memorabilia on eBay, some are listed under So-Called Dollars, come are listed under medals, etc. Many coin collections have tokens included in the collection. There are paper tokens, which might be listed under Exonumia, but they also may be listed under paper currency or stamps, or paper ephemera; learning which categories to look for an item can take a lot of time and experience. A number of tokens can be found in the Collectibles area under wholesale lots/other, which is where the junk drawer lots are located (the junk drawers are typically a person's watches, tokens, coins, and personal items); sometimes there are interesting collections of tokens in these lots. A Many sellers regularly sell large lots of tokens and medals to collectors and there are many of these lots for sale on eBay. There are also tokens available in many other categories - such as Science Fiction and Fantasy tokens such as the Game of Thrones tokens, etc.; , Many antique stores have old tokens and medals and coins. They are often not always priced reasonably but sometimes they have interesting tokens for sale. If there is an antique store locally where you can call in every once in a while, have the owner put aside tokens for your to look over and buy the ones you want.   Some stores will have a bowl containing a number of tokens and you can find many tokens at an antique mall.  Many coin dealers sell tokens and many of them have quite a few tokens for sale in addition to their regular stock.  There are many different clubs related to many different types of tokens - for example if you collect lumber tokens there are other lumber token collectors out there and you can join a club or organization which specializes in the type of tokens you want to collect. Many of these clubs have their own auctions and those clubs are a great place to pick up whichever tokens you may be looking for.   The clubs may also have swap meets, at which you can exchange tokens you have duplicates of, for ones you don't yet have.  Many public auctions have tokens in their auction. Visit a number of different auctions. Auctions may sell better tokens individually or they may sell bulk lots of tokens. This is a good way to buy a lot of better items, or items in bulk. There are some auctions which specialize in tokens.  There are many web sites where people specialize in tokens and are trying to sell tokens - some sell by the pound, etc.   Buy tokens on Amazon.com and other websites. These might be places you wouldn't ordinarily think of as having tokens but they may well have them if they specialize in selling "everything". Visit https://www.listia.com/. This is a website where you give items away for points and then you can spend the points on items you wish to obtain. They have a few tokens on this site, but not very many.  There may be collectors out there willing to part with some.  You can find tokens with a metal detector but it isn't easy.  Ask them if they've any such things stashed away in junk drawers, the attic or old coin collections. Trade tokens often get mixed in with amateur coin collections, so offering to rummage through these to find them can be a helpful suggestion and the person may be happy to let you do so.  

visit an online trading site to find tokens.  try antique stores.  try coin dealers.  join or visit clubs.  go to a public auction.  visit websites.  advertise in the newspaper that you're looking for trade tokens.  go metal detecting.  ask friends, neighbors and family for tokens. 

 Add the milk, coffee/espresso, and sugar to a pitcher or mixing bowl. Stir until uniform.   Here, as in the recipe above, you want to use strong coffee for the best flavor. See the section above for tips on getting the right kind of coffee for your frappuccino.  Pectin is a natural chemical substance derived from fruits that's used for thickening (especially when canning).It's tasteless, so it won't affect the flavor of this recipe. However, it will give you a slightly thicker, more "creamy" drink.  Continue to stir until you can't feel any solid sugar remaining in the liquid mixture. This should only take a few minutes.   If you're having trouble dissolving the sugar, try using dimple syrup instead. Simply heat equal parts water and sugar on the stove until you have a clear, sweet syrup which dissolves easily in drinks. See our article on making simple syrup for more information.  Once all the ingredients are combined and the sugar is dissolved, transfer the container to the fridge and chill. Serve the drink on its own or on the rocks (over ice).  

combine the main ingredients.  optionally, add pectin.  stir until the sugar is dissolved.  serve cold.

 There are a variety of e-cigarette or vapor styles, ranging from mini models that look like traditional cigarettes to larger APV models used by more experienced smokers.Mini or Cig-A-Like models look like tobacco cigarettes and are very popular. They are small and lightweight. If you are just starting your vapor habit, these models are a good choice.Mid-size models are the size of a cigar and last longer than the mini models. They produce more vapor than the mini models.Advanced personal vaporizers (i.e., MODs) are designed with the advanced e-cigarette smoker in mind since they produce much more vapor than both mid-size and mini models. They are about the size of a flashlight.; , Kits include all of the materials, vaporizers, batteries, and instructions for use. They are available for both complete beginners and more experienced smokers.Decide on whether you want a kit with pre-filled or refillable cartomizers. The pre-filled and disposable cartomizers are thrown out when they run out of the nicotine solution. In contrast, the refillable cartomizers need to be regularly refilled with nicotine solution.Decide how much you want to spend on a starter kit. Starter kits are typically between 30$ and 100$, Performance is commonly understood as including vapor production, throat hit, and battery life. To find the vapor cigarette that's right for you, consider all three factors.Vapor production is simply the amount of vapor produced by the e-cigarette.

 Combine the water, oats, brown sugar, honey, butter, salt, and cinnamon. Let it cool until it is lukewarm, about 10 to 15 minutes. The warm water will help to melt the butter, plump up the oatmeal, and dissolve the honey and sugar., Add the yeast and the flours to the bowl. Stir with a wooden spoon to combine.  Use a wooden spoon to combine the wet and the dry ingredients until it forms a thick dough.  You can do this by hand, for 10 minutes, or in a mixer for 5 to 7 minutes.   To knead the dough by hand, sprinkle a clean surface with flour. Dump the dough onto the floured surface. Use the heel of your hand to knead the dough together. Use the sprinkled flour to keep the dough from sticking to your hands. If there are any scrap pieces of dough, clear them with your hand and add them to the rest of the dough. Then, sprinkle the surface with flour again and continue kneading. Keep kneading the dough until it forms a smooth, round ball.  Transfer the dough to the bowl. Cover the dough with a towel or a greased piece of plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rise for 1-2 hours. It should double in size.   The dough will be pretty warm due to the boiling water, so it should become nice and puffy after an hour of sitting.  Use a bench knife or a sharp kitchen knife to slice the dough in half to form two loaves. Shape each half to resemble a loaf.   Tuck the corners down so they’re rounded. Sprinkle the top of the loaves with some flour.  Cover the pans with lightly greased plastic wrap or towels. Allow the loaves to rise again until they’re about 1” over the rim of the pans, about 60 to 90 minutes.  Once the loaves have risen, place them in the oven. Bake them for 35 to 40 minutes.   You can loosely cover them with aluminum foil after 25 minutes in the oven to prevent over-browning.  The interior of the bread should register 190 degrees F on a digital thermometer.   If you do not have access to a digital thermometer, you can determine if the bread is baked based on the golden brown color.  Let them cool complete before you slice them. Enjoy your honey oatmeal bread with some salted butter or your favorite jam.   You can store the loaves at room temperature in a well wrapped plastic cover, for several days. You can also freeze them to keep them fresh longer.  

take out the measuring glass.  take out a large mixing bowl.  pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients.  knead the dough.  lightly grease a large bowl with butter.  divide the dough in half.  place the loaves in two greased 8 ½” x 4 ½” bread pans.  preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit.  remove the loaves from the oven when they are golden brown.  turn the loaves out onto a rack to cool.

 You should begin with your feet in a “T” shape, or 3rd position in ballet. Put your feet with your heels together and your toes pointed outwards, so that your feet make a “V” shape. Then, slide one foot forward so that the heel is connected to the middle of your back foot. Your feet should now make a “T” shape.   It doesn’t matter which foot is forward. Your front foot should be pointed out at an angle.; , Put your weight on the heel of your front foot, and rotate your foot point straight forward. At the same time as you turn your front foot, you pick up your back foot off of the ground. Your front toe should rotate toward your back foot to end up with your foot pointing straight. For example, if your left foot is forward, your foot should rotate towards the right. , Put your weight on the toe of your front foot and rotate your foot back into the starting position by moving your heel. At the same time, place your back foot back down to have the middle of the foot meet the heel of your front foot in the “T” position.   Your feet should end up in the same “T” shape about 6 inches from where you started from.  Continue to rotate your front foot to the side by first moving the toe and then moving the heel. At the same time lift your back foot and put it back down to meet your front foot.   You should slowly move across the floor to the side when you continue to do this basic move repetitively.  Practice with one foot forward until you are comfortable completing the dance move across the floor. Then, practice with the opposite foot forward to move the other direction across the floor., Start by doing the T-step across the floor in one direction. Stop when you have enough room to do one more dance step before you want to change directions. To change directions, you’ll need to switch which foot is forward.  On the last dance step before you want to change directions, put your back foot down in front of your other foot so that you end up in the “T” position with your back foot in front. At the same time as putting your back foot down in front, rotate your other foot into the “T” position by moving the heel to position the foot at the starting angle., Lift your back foot and rotate the new front foot in the new direction you’re traveling. Do the dance steps all the way across the room in this direction, and then change your feet to travel in the opposite direction again.   Practice doing the T-step slowly from side to side to get comfortable with changing directions.  Start by standing with your legs together, and then pick one leg up so that your foot is off the floor and your thigh is parallel to the ground. It doesn’t matter which leg you start with.  Hop the leg you’re standing on to slide it back into a small lunge. At the same time, place your other leg back down on the floor with your knee slightly bent. You should end up in a lunge with one leg forward and one back.   Don’t do a big hop. You should only hop high enough to slide your foot back into a lunge position., Gently hop your front foot to slide it a few inches back to end up with your leg centered under your body. At the same time, bring your back leg forward and lift it so that your foot is off the floor and your thigh is parallel to the ground.   This position should be the same as the first position you made, but with the opposite leg raised off the ground. You should be ready to do the moves again with the opposite leg as the standing leg.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 continually to dance the running man. You should end up doing two small hops on one foot as you slide it to center and then back into a lunge while you raise the other foot up to do the same thing on that side. Continue doing the dance steps on one side and then the next to dance the Running Man.   The hops are really small. The dance move is actually sliding your foot backwards so make sure you only lift it enough to slide. The dance move should be smooth and not look like you’re jumping.  Start by dancing the T-step until you are near the middle of the floor. Make sure you only go one direction to get to the center of the floor. It doesn’t matter which direction you travel in, so choose the direction that’s easiest for you to dance the T-step in.  To make the change from dancing the T-step to dancing the Running Man, you need to start the T-step and end up in a lunge. To start the T-step, lift your back foot while rotating the front foot’s toes to end up with the front foot pointed straight forward. Keep your front foot forward and place your back foot down behind to end up in a lunge position.  From the lunge position, hop your front foot back to slide it to center while you lift your back leg up. Then, hop your front foot again to slide it back while placing your other foot down to end up in another lunge. Continue doing the Running Man until you’re ready to change back to the T-step again.  To switch back from the Running Man to the T-step, you need to do half of the Running Man and end up with your feet back in the “T” shape to start the T-step. Hop your front foot to slide it back to center while lifting your back foot up to do the first half of the Running Man. Then, leave your front foot where it is and put your back foot down behind your front foot in the “T” position. You are now ready to start the T-step again.  Practice transitioning between the two dance steps to be able to smoothly switch from dancing the T-step to dancing the Running Man. When you can easily transition, you can have fun switching back and forth as you dance the Melbourne Shuffle.  

start with your feet in a “t” shape.  pick up your back foot and move the toe of your front foot at the same time.  place your back foot back down while rotating the heel of your front foot back into the starting position.  repeat the basic move of rotating your toe and then heel.  practice the basic step moving in both directions.  do the basic move across the floor.  place the back foot down in front to change directions.  begin to do the dance steps in the new direction.  pick one leg up.  push your standing leg back as you put your other leg down.  slide your front foot back to center and pick up your back leg.  repeat the steps of sliding your front foot to center and then back into a lunge.  dance the t-step first.  do half a t-step and end in a lunge.  start the running man.  do half of the running man and end up with your feet in a “t” shape.  combine the steps smoothly to dance the melbourne shuffle.

Even something such as a Royals t-shirt will do.; , Attend games frequently and become familiar with player stats and positions. Game tickets are usually cheap because, as you may already know, the Royals aren't the best team in baseball. Not even close.

After a slow start for their first few seasons, the Royals were one of the best teams in the AL West throughout the late 1970s and 1980s. They made constant playoff appearances until 1985 when they finally won a World Series.  They have not been in the playoffs since 1985. They remained an above average team from 1986 to about 1994. After that things began to go downhill. The payroll went down and so did the quality of the players they signed. In 1997 the Royals had the chance to move to the National League Central but turned it down. The Royals thought they would do better in the AL. This came back to haunt them. The AL Central is arguably the toughest division in baseball. The NL Central is now the worst. In 2002 they lost over 100 games. In 2003 the losing stopped briefly and the Royals posted their last winning season with what was arguably the most talented Royals team since the early 1990s. In 2004 they were a popular choice to go to the playoffs, but ended with another 100 loss season. In 2005 they lost a club-worst 116 games. 2006 was slightly better with exactly 100 losses.  The Royals hoped to make a comeback in the 2007 season with players such as Gil Meche and Alex Gordon. Much progress was made in 2007 with 69-93 record. Manager Buddy Bell resigned after the season and was replaced with Trey Hillman of Japan. The 2008 season started well for KC, they sat atop the AL Central standings for a couple weeks and had a decent April. The rest of the year was up and down, as the inconsistent team of young players struggled on offense, but put up average defensive/pitching stats. After a spectacular September that "saved the year", the Royals ended up at 75-87, and finishing in 4th place out of the 5 division teams, avoiding the cellar for the first time since 2003. 2009 was a hopeful year for the Royals, they signed talented CF Coco Crisp and power hitter Mike Jacobs. 2009 started with a promising 18-11 start, but then KC quickly fell out of contention, winning less than 30% of their games for the next 2 months. Key players such as Crisp, Gordon, and Jose Guillen were injured much of the year, and others such as Jacobs and most of the bullpen, failed to meet expectations. The Royals overall preformed horribly in '09, but two bright spots were first baseman Billy Butler and pitcher Zack Greinke. Greinke was arguably the best pitcher in baseball, finishing with a 16-11 record and the league's lowest ERA, and he finished second in strikeouts. He is a favorite to win the Cy Young (to be announced in November 2009). Butler emerged as perhaps the only reliable offensive player, hitting .301 with a club high 93 RBIs and 21 home runs.  The Royals will let you down often, so be prepared. It isn't easy being a Royals fan. The Royals get much criticism from the media. But when they win, and you're there to witness it, it's an awesome feeling.

 Buying a set can lead to a poor fit. Choose your tops and bottoms separately because you are likely a different size on the top than you are on the bottom. For example, you may be a medium on top but a large might fit you best on the bottom. Try different sizing combinations until you find exactly what you love and feel most confident in. , There are many options for bikini tops available. Finding the right one depends on your style and body type. The most basic bikini top is the triangle top. This top is adjustable but does not offer a lot of support. The half cup, balconette, and plunge shaped tops are similar to bras and offer more support. Bandeau and strapless bikini tops are great for avoiding tan lines.Choose a swimsuit top you are comfortable in and that you like the style of. Try on various styles because you never know what you might like.   Get a swim top you can slip on if you hate tying your top or it always comes untied. Stick to a classic shape if you want to avoid strange tan lines. , If you can never get your large bust to fit in a bikini top comfortably, opt for a top with a demi bra. The extra support will make you feel more confident at the beach or pool. For even more support, you can get a top with underwire, including underwire straps. , If your bust is small, get a bikini top with ties that you can adjust. Having the ability to adjust your suit will help you get your bikini tight and close to your chest so it does not fall off. If you want a strapless top, choose one that has boning on the sides and removable padding to keep it from sliding off. , The Euro or normal bikini bottom is low on the hips and is the most common bikini choice. The Brazilian bikini bottom has half coverage on the back. Choose a thong bottom if you want no coverage on the back. You can opt for board shorts or skirted bottoms instead of traditional swimsuit bottoms for more coverage. Get high waited bottoms if you do not want to show your belly button. Strings on the sides of the bottoms make your hips appear smaller., You can choose the color of your bikini based on your skin tone if you would like. Emeralds and pastels look good on light skin. Medium skin tones look best in bright colors and metallic. Dark skin tones look great with bold blues and reds. These are only suggestions. You can wear whatever color of swimsuit you think looks best on you.   Be aware that white bikinis can be see-through when they get wet. Bright colors can make your skin look more tanned. , Bring a close and trusted friend or family member, like your mom or sister, to shop with you and to wait outside the dressing room for you. They can help you choose what looks best on you and get you a different size while you are changing. Having support can be great if the bikini shopping starts to get you down and you need encouragement. , You can take your bra off when trying on a swimsuit but make sure you keep your underwear on to avoid spreading and contracting any diseases. Wear a thin pair of underwear to the store to give you a better idea of what the bathing suit looks like without the underwear. , When you put the swimsuit top on, make sure any strings are tied tightly. Adjust the swimsuit so it is comfortable but won’t come off. Arrange your breasts by gently placing them toward the center of your torso. Check in the mirror to see if the top is too high on your back or sides and adjust the straps. The top should not puncher you but also should not be able to slip off. Try jumping up and down in the dressing room to see if the top stays in place.  Put the bottoms on over your underwear. You want the bottoms to be a little snug because they expand about a half inch when they get wet. Slip two fingers between the bottoms and your skin. If two fingers don’t fit, the swimsuit is too tight. Extra room between your fingers and the suit means that it is too large. Your swimsuit will get even larger when it gets wet, so it is important the bottoms are not too big. , You will be able to see what the bikini looks like from all sides if you take pictures from a variety of angles and lighting. Take the photos yourself or have your friend take the photos for you. This will help you remember what the other bikinis you liked looked like on you when you are trying on different bikinis and going to different stores. , The size of swimsuits varies greatly from store to store. In some brands you might be a small and in other brands you might be a large. If something does not fit you, try not to worry about it. Move on to the next swimsuit.

 While you may want to tell the child as soon as you know about the death, you should wait for an appropriate time. Do not tell the child about the dog’s death right before they have to go to school or to bed. This may cause them to have trouble concentrating or sleeping.After they return home from school is a good time to tell them.   If you know in advance that the dog is dying or that you will need to euthanize the dog, you can start the talk early. You can say, “Roger is very old and sick. The vets did everything they could, and now we have to say goodbye. This is the nicest thing that we can do for him. He will die peacefully and without pain.”; , Use direct language. Tell your child that the dog is dead. Do not use euphemisms like “Bailey went to sleep” or “Macy is now in heaven.” Young children often take these very literally, and it may scare or confuse them.You can say, “We have very sad news. Daisy died today.” Avoid telling your child that the dog ran away. This may confuse them, and they may expect the dog to return., The death of a family dog may be the first time the child has lost someone in their life. Your child may not understand that their dog is gone forever. This may be a good opportunity to teach young children about death and mourning in a healthy, protected environment.   You should explain that death is natural. You can say, “All animals eventually pass away. The important thing is that we remember our loved ones, and we keep them in our hearts forever.” If your child is very young, they may ask you what death is. It may be easiest to describe it by saying that the body stops working. You can say “Death is when you stop breathing, and your heart stops beating.”Younger children may not understand that death is permanent or final. You might tell them, “Death is natural, and it lasts forever. Max may not return to us, but that does not mean we have to forget him.” Over time, your child will come to understand death., Your child may have many questions about what death is or where their beloved dog went. Patiently answer these questions. Keep in mind that their questioning may not occur all at once; they may have many questions over a period of days.   If your child asks what will happen to the dog’s body, you can say, “We are going to have Max cremated. This means that his body will be turned into ashes. Don’t worry. He can’t feel pain anymore.” You can also say,“We’re going to bury Lulu in the backyard.” Avoid using words like “burn” or “fire.”If your child asks what happens to the dog after death, you can take the opportunity to explain any beliefs about the afterlife that you may hold. You can also say “I don’t know” if you're not sure about the afterlife. You can even state that although the dog is no longer with you, they will always live in your happy memories of them.If your child asks if they are going to die or if you are going to die, you can tell them, “It’s not likely to happen for a long time.”, What and how you tell your child can depend on their age, maturity, and relationship with the dog. Think about how much your child is capable of understanding and how they might react to the news.Young children may not understand what is going on, but they should still be told that the dog has died. Older children may be able to handle the news better, but they may also begin to act out as part of their grief.   If the dog was killed in an accident, you should be careful with what details you tell your children. Younger children may become scared or anxious if you tell them that the dog was hit by a car or attacked by another dog. Instead, you can say, “Sparky died today. It was very sudden.” Older children may be able to handle the idea that their dog was killed in an accident, but you should only inform them about the cause of death, not any of the particular details. For example, you can say “There was an accident. Lulu was hit by a car, and unfortunately, she did not survive.” In this case you should emphasize that no one was at fault. You can say, “It was an accident. We’re not blaming anyone for it.”  

choose a good time.  tell your child that the dog has died.  explain death.  answer their questions.  consider what is appropriate to tell your child.

 If the bolts are damaged, then you may just want to replace the individual pieces but leave the seat intact. If the body of the seat itself is in poor shape, however, then you may just want to swap it out for the sake of longevity. Look for toilet seats at a local hardware or home-and-garden store.  There are two standard commercial toilet seat shapes: round and elongated. The round seats are perfectly round, while the "elongated" seats are oblong and egg-shaped. Buy the seat that matches your bowl.   Try to find a seat made by the same company that manufactured your toilet. Off-brand seats may well do the trick, but they may not fit quite so perfectly.  You will need to unscrew the old seat, set it aside, and then tighten the new seat onto the bowl. Make sure that the new seat is aligned straight onto the toilet!   Save the bolts and nuts from the old seat in case you need to replace a bolt on your new seat.  

consider buying a new toilet seat.  know which type of seat you need.  install the new seat. 

 Watch TV, provide snacks and drinks and have a good time. Chances are you're going to be up pretty late, so just enjoy it.; , These are great as you can reflect on things that weren't so good last year, and think of ways to improve them for the year coming up! Also, they can improve your daily lifestyle. Can't think of any? Here are some ideas to get you going:  ,,,,,,, Say thank you to the friends who gave you presents. Be happy when you go into school, because even though all the celebrations are over, just think of all the new opportunities, topics and fun coming up. Plus, now you have an opportunity to enjoy school more. Work harder in lessons, always try your best, have all your homework done and be polite, respectful and nice to everyone.  The trick to dealing with this is to not stoop down to their level, but let them know you aren't going to put up with what they're saying. If someone says something about you, say something like "Yes, you may think that, but I don't agree with you" and walk away. Very common with girls, if some bitching is going around, don't get involved or talk about other people behind their back. Not doing any bitching makes you come across as a trustworthy friend. If you hear that someone has said something about you, but the mate who apparently has is a really good friend, don't get too upset about it. However, if you think it may have been true, ask for a little chat. Be calm and just say that you heard something, but don't be mean. Let her have her say and listen. If someone starts being catty, walk away and do something else. Sadly, mates can suddenly not like a girl in their group and turn nasty. If this is you, either talk to them about it and make up, or if she continues and won't listen to you, spend more time with your true mates and even make new friends. This will make you feel happier, knowing you have mates which are kind, caring, supportive and funny.  Remember that it's important to chill and enjoy yourself, instead of always being busy busy busy! Watch TV or a film, read, go on the computer, write, just do whatever you want and have fun! Also, make the most of your weekends.  Arrange a fun day shopping with your mum, see your cousins or just head out to town. Make the most of your days. After all, life's too short to sit around doing nothing.  This includes homework, tidying and sorting your room, finding something that's lost, etc. When these things are out of the way, then you can just chill and enjoy yourself.  These things are great qualities to have!  , You must get permission first, and if it's a yes, ask what you can do. If you would like to and can paint your walls a color you really like, baby blues, light pinks and purples or candy pink are sweet, girlie, positive colors. Try not to choose something too dark, as lighter colors can make your room appear bigger, whereas darker shades can make your room look and feel smaller. Cover everything up with old sheets and ask someone for help. When the walls are dry, you could take the advantage of moving your furniture in different angles, as you would have had to move it out of the way for painting. Make sure that no furniture is blocking anything you want in view, such as a window. Tidy up! Having a cool room means it's tidy, neat and organized, not like a pigsty. Take any rubbish downstairs, vacuum, wipe down surfaces and donate anything that's in good condition but you don't want anymore to a local charity shop. Organize your desk, draws, anything else and put things back. Change your duvet, even. Finally, make your room "you" by personalizing it. Display your favorite things, put up posters, art or photos of your favorite music and family and friends. Make a sign with your name on it. Now admire your new room and enjoy it.  Hope this year is the best for you.  

just stay in and enjoy new year's eve with your most loved ones, such as family.  the next day, january 1st, how about making some new year's resolutions?,  be a better friend.  ,  help out more at home, be helpful.  ,  be a more confident you and happy with who you are.  ,  remember to chill out more and have "me time" regularly.  ,  keep your room in tip top condition!  ,  write them down to help you remember and make sure you keep them!  ,  when you go back to school, say hi to all your friends, ask how they've been and what they got for christmas.  of course there may be a few people who still try to stir up trouble and make up other people feel bad.  chill out more.  have fun!,  be certain that if anything needs to be done, it's done!,  be nice, kind, helpful and talkative.  how about giving your room a new look for the new year?,  just live your life to the full, work hard at school, be a brilliant friend, have fun and enjoy yourself. 

 If you have insurance, whether self-provided or through an employer, your first step should be to check with your provider to see what doctors are in-network. Call and ask for a list of doctors in your area or go online and use your provider’s tool to see what doctors are available to you.In-network physicians are those who actively work with your insurance company to offer you special negotiated rates. These physicians generally charge less and cover more than out-of-network physicians. Often, when seeing an in-network primary care physician, you will only have to pay a copay, typically between $20 and $40, for a general visit. Check your plan details to see how much your copay for each visit will be.; , Doctor’s offices tend to have dynamic relationships with insurance companies, so it is beneficial to call their office and confirm your coverage. Give the office or clinic a call, and ask to speak with a billing specialist about accepted insurance.Ask the clinic, “Do you accept this plan?” Be sure to give them not only your insurance provider, but your specific plan, as they may accept some but not all plans from your provider. Plan details can be found online, on your insurance card, or by calling your insurance provider.  If you get your insurance through a school or employer, chances are that many of the people around you will have the same coverage. Ask friends or coworkers that you trust for recommendations for a good primary care physician in your network.Let your friend or coworker know, “I’m looking for a new doctor that is covered by our insurance plan. Do you have a primary care doctor that you like?”  , If you have a reason for going to a doctor out of network, such as traveling outside of your network area, contact your insurance company and ask them about doctors in the area. There may be out of network professionals that still takes your insurance so you aren't left with the total bill.Let your insurance company know about your reason for going out of network.

Check online at CertificationMatters.org to see if a potential physician is certified.Board certified physicians are also expected to go through continued education and training, ensuring that they stay up-to-date on new standards and best practices.  Typically, a general practitioner serves as a primary care physician, but internal medicine doctors are also often able to provide primary care. If you require a certain type of special care for a particular disease or part of your body, check with local medical groups and hospitals to see if there is an internist there with whom you can work.Internists typically specialize in a particular part of the body, such as the heart or kidneys, or in treating a certain type of medical complication, such as diabetes care. Internists are not surgeons. Instead, they work on diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions and complications through standard medical practices. Pediatricians are specialists who work with children. If you are looking for a primary care physician for a child under the age of 14-16, a pediatrician is often the best choice.  Reviews and client testimonial are a helpful tool to gauge a doctor’s bedside manner. Look online at review sites as well as specialty sites like ZocDoc and HealthGrades to see what others have to say about their experience with a physician.Keep in mind that people are more likely to review what they consider to be negative experiences. Take comments like, “they kept me waiting past my appointment time,” lightly and instead look for indicators of malpractice or poor treatment of patients.If you know anyone who has been to a physician personally, ask them about their experience. Let them know, “I’m thinking about seeing a new primary care physician. What has your experience been like with this doctor?”  , Once you’ve found a couple doctors you think you may want to work with, take a look into their backgrounds to help you pick the best doctor. Take a look at factors like where they went to medical school, how long they have been practicing, how close they are to your home or office, and whether they have extended or weekend hours.If English is not your first language, check to see if the doctor speaks any other languages. Working with a doctor in your first language can help make things more comfortable and easy for you as a patient. Most of this type of background information can be found by checking online on the hospital or clinic’s website, or by calling the doctor’s office directly.  Before you can set an appointment, you need to make sure your intended physician is accepting new patients. Call their office and ask, “Is your practice accepting new patients at this time?”If the doctor is not accepting new patients at this moment, you may be able to ask their office for recommendations for similar physicians in the area.  Call your previous doctor’s office and ask them to transfer your medical records to your new doctor. You may be able to request the records be sent directly to you through a patient portal, or you may have to ask your previous doctor’s office to send them directly to your new physician.Be sure to request that your previous physician include lab results and records for any recent MRIs, x-rays, and hospital visits. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, your doctor must comply with a request to provide you with copies of your medical records. If your doctor will not forward your records onto your new physician, go to their office and request your records directly., Once you have chosen a new primary care physician, schedule an appointment for a general visit. This will give you the chance to get to know your new doctor, and it will help your doctor become familiar with your medical records and expectations.If you have any specific questions regarding the doctor’s practice or your care options, have them ready to ask during the appointment. Let your doctor know about any recent or ongoing conditions for which you have been treated, as well as any medications that you are currently taking. After the appointment, check in with yourself and evaluate how you feel. Do not continue seeing a doctor if they made you feel uncomfortable or unwelcome in their practice.  

check with your insurance.  confirm with the doctor.  ask for recommendations.  go out of network.  check for board certification.  determine specialties.  check reviews.  do some background research.  call to see if the doctor is accepting new patients.  transfer your medical records.  schedule your first appointment. 

 If you can prepare for a visit, think about whether your child usually becomes extremely quiet around strangers or adults or does he/she turn into a complete blabbermouth?   Let your child know that he/she will be coming to work with you and meeting your boss. Don't plant ideas or even describe your boss, just look for a reaction--your child may not have any reaction or may not even remember your boss. If he/she has no reaction, now is the time to use positive adjectives (even if they are not true or your don’t believe them) about your boss. Words like “nice,” “friendly” and even “helpful” are good words that a child will understand. Discuss what is considered to be appropriate behavior at work. If your child attends school liken work to school, reminding him/her of manners and how teachers and other adults should be treated with respect. Review some general rules such as no running or screaming in the office, not to interrupt adults when they are talking (unless you are bleeding or it’s an emergency) and to say “please” and “thank you.” Use this moment to open the floor to questions from your child. Be truthful but always lean toward the positive. Don’t use adjectives that could be have a double meaning such as saying that your boss has a “strong” presence in the office, which could be misconstrued as being overbearing. If you are odds with your boss, stick to the rules you hand down to your child, “If you can’t say something nice, don’t say anything at all.” Keep comments brief, positive and nondescript.; , If you tell your child not to talk about the bathroom or mom’s superhero action figure collection that will most likely be the first thing he/she goes to when meeting your boss.   Avoid listing hot topics to avoid. For example if your boss is portly, don’t tell your child, “Now Mr. Anderson is pretty fat so be sure you don’t say anything about weight.” What will be the first thing your child remembers during the meeting--fat. Recall how you’ve described your boss in the past to either your spouse and/or your family. Did you say that your boss had a hot temper or was insane? Remember if you’ve used derogatory comments around your child in the past you’ll have to think of a way to change his/her perception before arrival at work. After you ask your child if he/she remembers your boss reinforce the positive visual or image you are trying to create by using upbeat descriptive words. Provide a list of topics that your child may ask or discuss when around your boss. Along with the reminder of the best way to speak with adults, let your child know a few topics he/she could cover such as the sports, the weather or your new puppy, for example.  Long before your child makes a trip to your office, remember that you are your child’s main role model. How you approach and interact with others is not only being observed but also studied by your child.   Have something positive to say to and about everyone you meet. Even if you aren’t a fan of one of the moms in your child’s class never tell your child that you think the other mother is a gold digger, for example (or any other derogatory comment). Instead you can just general, blanket statements such as saying that she is nice and be pleasant when you must interact with this individual. Use your manners. Sometimes even adults forget their manners, which is why it’s especially important that you say “thank you” when necessary, make eye contact with people and smile. Show your children proper table manners. In the event you could possible dine with your boss or any other adults, it’s important that your child knows proper table etiquette. He/she doesn’t need to know which fork goes with which dish, but should understand the basics such as napkin in the lap, elbows off the table and don’t talk with a full mouth of food.  “Out of the mouths of babes” is an accurate description of how kids can say truthful but embarrassing things. Instead of turning beat red and then yelling at your child, have a response ready that will allow you to retain some shred of dignity and possibly your job.   Learn to address your child’s actions with humor. Check your boss’s reaction and then roll your eyes and laugh off what your child said. Be sure your boss sees that you are not thrilled with your child, but don’t have a tantrum or yell at your child, especially in front of the boss. Be sure you address what your child has said in a controlled, gentle voice. Correct your child by saying, “That isn’t an accurate observation Jimmy” and then apologize to your boss. Make direct eye contact with your child so that he/she knows that what he said wasn’t spot on. Don’t make wild eyes to the point where you are glaring at your child but your child should know “the look” that means he/she needs to stop talking--immediately.  

consider your child’s typical “go to” banter.  don’t plant ideas in his/her head before meeting your boss.  set a good example when socializing in public.  know how to react if your child says something embarrassing.

 The general rule during an emergency is that if it is not safe for you, then it is not safe for your dog. Always evacuate your pet with you, if possible. Many people leave their dogs at home during an emergency evacuation because they believe their pet will be more comfortable or they think they will only be gone for one night.

Dogs can get severely injured, lost, or worse if left alone during a disaster.In some instances you may not be allowed to return to an area that has been evacuated for days or even weeks after the evacuation. Your dog will not be able to look after themselves.  If you have a dog, or any other pet, you should always evacuate early. Typically, major weather disasters can be predicted. If they are calling for a major weather event or storm in your area, you should always evacuate with your dog before it is too late. If you try and wait out the storm, you run the risk of a mandatory evacuation or rescue.In some cases, during a forced evacuation or emergency rescue, emergency responders will not allow you to bring your dog.  It is also important to consider the fact that you may not be at home when a disaster hits the area. As a result, you should prepare in advance to have a friend, neighbour, or relative evacuate your dog for you, if necessary. This individual should have a key to your house, be familiar with your dog, know where your dog’s emergency kit is kept, and have all of your contact information.You should also set a specified location where you can meet to pick up your pets.  

evacuate your dog.  evacuate early with a dog.  create a buddy system with neighbours and friends. 

 You can use a wrap or a scarf. A long, rectangular scarf is the best kind to use for this style. 55 inches long and ten inches wide is a standard size for a scarf. Some of the best materials to use are jersey, chiffon, and viscose. Silk looks nice, but it may not hold as well.They can be purchased at department stores, vintage shops, and at stores that specialize in headwraps., This look works best if you tie your hair in a top knot because the wrap needs to be tied tightly and loose hair will not fit well under the wrap. You do not need to do anything if your hair is already short., Put the center of the wrap at the back of your head. The two ends should be extended past your face. The wrap should cover the entire back of your head. It should not be folded., Use the two ends to tie a knot. The knot should be tied just above the center of your hairline. Once you have tied the knot, pull the ends to make sure it is secure., At this point, the ends should be hanging down on either side of the knot. Fold the fabric until you create an oversized bow with a bow flap on each side. Once you are satisfied with the bow, tuck the end into the bow flaps to complete the look.

 If you don't know anyone familiar with a soft surface to practice on. Gymnastic pads or mats are highly recommended. If you don't have access to them, use a firm mattress.; ,   Jump straight up as high as you can. Bend your knees and powerfully push your body up towards the sky. Use your arms to help you reach higher, and land on the balls of your feet. Do this several times. The idea is to increase your vertical leap so that you get enough height when doing the flip. Repeat with a running head start. Jog a few steps, hop, plant your feet and punch up with the balls of your feet as high as you can. Practice forward rolls from a standing position. Stand, roll, and stand. This will allow you to get a feel for how you will tuck in the air. Combine the above. Take a running start, jump high, and tuck in (but don't flip!). Bring your knees to your chest at the highest point. You don't need to hold your knees, but you can if you want.  Dive roll to get you over the fear of rotating over your head. It'll also help you get the hang of leading the rotation with your shoulders, not with your legs. Jump a bit up and forward on a dive and slightly tuck your head inward towards your chest. You should feel your body starting to rotate without much well...effort.  Don't run so fast that you throw yourself off balance when you plant, and don't run so slow that you can't complete the flip. Many people have a tendency to run fast, thinking this will make for a powerful flip, but they often end up not jumping high enough, which results in landing on their back. A fast jog is sufficient.  Your feet should be planted at about your shoulders' width but further forwards than your shoulders to help get you the explosive height that you need. Lift your arms while you jump, so that your arms are above your head as your feet hit the ground.Quick tip do not stomp on ground . It takes your height away from your jump push off with the balls of your feet not the whole foot. In the next step, your arms will be thrown up and forward to generate more spin for your flip.   Jump before you flip. Don't tuck your head until after your feet leave the ground, or you may not get the full rotation., It's quite possible to do a good front flip without your arms swinging, but it does make things a lot easier. Remember to "punch" off the ground with your feet to achieve maximum height. To help your body go up rather than forward, look up at the ceiling as you jump. You don't have to turn your face all the way up--just enough so you can see the ceiling above you.  Try to spread your legs slightly when you tuck rather than having your knees touching each other. This gives you a smaller profile and therefore a faster rotation. It can also help to avoid injury to the face. A knee is much stronger than a nose and will break it.   Keep your tuck tight, not loose. If you don't tuck tightly enough with your shoulders, your landing will be unbalanced and sloppy.  Some people suggest "looking" for your landing, but it's not as easy as it sounds to watch the ground while you're whirling in a circle. "Feel" your way through the flip.   Don't untuck too soon. You will land leaning backwards and fall on your rear. Hold the tuck a bit before opening.  Bend your knees as you land to absorb some of the force, and use your arms to balance yourself so you don't fall forwards or backwards. Always land on the balls of your feet. 

enlist the help of an experienced spotter or you might get hurt.  prepare with exercises to strengthen your form.  run forward at a moderate speed.  after gaining a suitable amount of speed, take a small hopping jump and land with both your feet planted firmly.  jump into the air from your planted position, push your arms up and forward then bring your arms down to meet your legs, pulling your knees into your chest in a tight, tucked position to create more rotation.  pull your knees to your chest and tuck your body into a ball so that you'll rotate the entire 360 degrees.  untuck from the ball as soon as you feel yourself becoming right-side-up in the air.  land with your feet spread the same distance as before, about the same as your shoulders. 

 There are thousands in the English language that don't rhyme with any other word. Challenge yourself to find as many of them as possible. This can also be a good competition among friends - who can come up with the longest list?; , There's nothing that rhymes with the word "purple" but "hurtful" comes pretty close! How many more "almost" rhymes can you think of?  , Using the words you've collected on your list of non-rhymers, compose a poem that doesn't rhyme at all! Make it as serious or as hilarious as you like - it's all a bit of fun.  Ask for his or her opinion of words that don't rhyme. If you're an editor of a school or college paper, print up the article to honor the day and help spread knowledge about non-rhyming words.  Try to order food with words in it that don't rhyme. Orange and sushi are excellent words to start with!  , Have everyone write non-rhyming poems (as above).

; , Be sure to note what you learned from each of these situations.  Ask them to describe the events in your list from their memory. Note differences between how you remember the moment versus how they do and how important they perceive the moments to be in the grand scale of the marriage.  These may or may not make it into the autobiography, but provide color and that ever-important spousal point-of-view.  It will undoubtedly have them. If the list doesn't, read and reread (rewrite if necessary) it until it does. ,, Would you, he/she pay $24.95 for this autobiography. If not, move on to revision.  Would anyone besides me want to read this? How can my introduction be more engaging? Do I sound preachy? How can my conclusion be more thought-provoking? Revise the outline until these questions have the answers befitting a best-selling autobiography.  If you have trouble putting it all together, try writing short stories for each moment. This will separate the 'men from the boys' as far as your important moments go. If a moment is too weak to stand on it's own it may need more interesting content, a little research thrown in, or maybe it needs to be replaced with something else.  

write a clear objective describing what you want your autobiography to do for the eventual reader.  based on the objective, create a list of moments in your married life that, when described, will help achieve the objective.  run the list by your (current or past) significant other.  ask your (current or past) significant other for an 'important moments list' of their own.  identify the recurring themes or images in your list.  use the recurring theme to link the moments into a full-bodied narrative.  ,  outline an introduction and conclusion citing your narrative's theme as a source of inspiration.  ,  read through the content compiled so far or ask a trusted friend/family member to do so and critique as if it was picked it up from the shelf at the local book store.  revise by asking the tough questions: is this interesting?,  begin building the story. 

 Brush your hair to remove any tangles. If your hair is curly, you might want to finger-comb it instead, or brush it with a wide-toothed comb. This will help prevent it from getting too frizzy. If you have straight hair, curl your hair using your favorite curling method.          This style works well for both short and long hair.; , You can also create a side part instead, but make sure that it angles towards the center-back of your head. You want your hair to be split evenly in the back.  Leave the other side of your hair loose. This will make it easier to create the braids, especially if you have thick, curly hair that likes to get everywhere.  If you plan on doing a Dutch braid (reverse French braid), cross the left and right strands under the middle one. If you plan on doing a French braid, cross the left and right strands over the middle one. You only need to braid for two cross-overs.          A Dutch braid sticks out of your hair. A French braid lays smoothly against your hair.  Add a small strand of hair to the left and right sections before crossing them under        , You can tie it off now with a clear elastic or a hair tie that matches your hair color.If you have very long hair, you can continue normal braiding for a few more cross-overs before tying it off.  Unclip the hair on the other side of your head, and make another identical braid. If you crossed the strands under last time, make sure that you cross them under this time around. If you crossed the strands over last time, then you need to cross them over this time as well.  If you have naturally curly hair, you could shape the curls by wrapping them around your finger. Feel free to make one big curl, or several small ones. If you curled your straight or wavy hair previously, you may need to touch it up with a curling iron.  For a more boho-chic look, you could muss up the hair at your temples to give it a wispier look. You could also tie pretty ribbons around the ends of your braids to hide the hair ties, or clip in cute hair accessories.         

prep your hair.  part your hair down the center.  tie and clip half of your hair out of the way.  begin with a normal braid.  continue with a dutch or french braid.  tie the braid off when you reach the nape of your neck.  repeat the process on the other side of your head.  touch up your curls, if needed.  consider adding some final touches. 

 Your Ocicat will appreciate a soft, comfortable bed to sleep in every night. Get a special bed for your Ocicat and place it somewhere that you have noticed him sleeping. Many Ocicats like to be up on high perches, so placing the bed on a sturdy shelf or dresser may encourage him to use his bed even more.  Ocicats need to scratch, so make sure that you provide your Ocicat with plenty of scratching posts so that he can indulge this habit. Try placing a couple of corrugated cardboard scratching boards and rope wrapped boards throughout your house.If you ever catch your Ocicat scratching something that he should not, do not yell at him or throw things at him. Just pick him up gently and place him next to one of his scratching boards. After a while, he will understand that he is only supposed to use his scratching board when he needs to scratch. Try rubbing a bit of catnip on your Ocicat’s scratching boards to make them more attractive.  Your Ocicat will need to have access to clean litter boxes at all times for his bathroom needs. Keep his litter boxes clean by scooping them out daily and changing the litter at least once per week. To get your Ocicat to use his litter box, you should also:Provide enough litter boxes. You should have at least one more litter box than the total number of cats in your house. For example, if you have three cats, then you need to have at least four litter boxes.  Use a fine-grained litter. Cats prefer fine-grained litter in their boxes. Use a clumping kind to make it easier for you to clean and fill the box so that there is about two inches of litter in the box.  Place litter boxes away from food and water. Cats do not like to go to the bathroom near their food and water dishes. Placing litter boxes in these areas may cause your cat to avoid using the box or lead to poor eating and drinking habits.  Ocicats need regular veterinary care to stay healthy. Make sure that you take your Ocicat to see a veterinarian soon after you get him and take him for regular checkups once per year. During these visits, your cat’s veterinarian will examine your cat, run tests (such as a feline leukemia test), and give your cat vaccinations (such as a rabies vaccination).   Make sure to make annual appointments for your Ocicat and take him to see the veterinarian any time you suspect that he is not feeling well., Spaying and neutering is an excellent way to control the pet population and protect your pet from certain health and behavioral issues. Talk to your cat’s veterinarian about spaying or neutering your cat as soon as possible to prevent bad behaviors, such as spraying, aggression, and roaming, from becoming ingrained in your cat.Keep in mind that spaying and neutering may protect your Ocicat from some health issues as well, such as uterine infections, enlarged prostate, and certain forms of cancer. 

give your ocicat a soft bed.  put up scratching posts for your ocicat.  provide enough litter boxes for your ocicat.  take your ocicat to see a veterinarian.  spay or neuter your ocicat.

 Dynamic stretches are exercises that loosen your muscles while boosting your heart rate. You may have heard that stretching prior to exercising can be harmful; this piece of advice applies to static stretching, which involves elongating the muscle for an extended period of time. By choosing to do dynamic stretches, you lower the risk of inadvertently hurting yourself or decreasing your performance. Some examples of dynamic stretches are:   Hip circles. Standing with your hands on your hips and your feet slightly more than shoulder-width apart, rotate your hips clockwise. After a few repetitions, rotate your hips counter-clockwise. Leg swings. Stand next to a wall or fence for balance. With your right hand on the wall, swing your right leg backward and then forward for a few repetitions. Turn around and repeat with your left leg. Half-squats. Stand up straight, then slowly bend at the knee until your thighs are parallel with the floor. You might want to stretch your arms out in front of you for balance. When your thighs are parallel to the floor (about "halfway" down), slowly press back up, keeping your back straight.  Many runners find that sprinting is easier after they've already been exercising for a while. Since sprinting is often used as a last-minute boost of speed at the end of a long race, it can be helpful to practice sprinting after your muscles have warmed up considerably.  

do dynamic stretches.  do some light jogging or running prior to your sprint. 

 If your feeder has insufficient amount of vibrations or if it is working slowly, there is a good chance that the feeding tray or base plate is not mounted properly. To overcome this problem, check the mounting arrangements and height of the tray so as to provide rigidity to the instrument.  The coil gap in a vibratory feeder ought to be set properly else there would be functional issues with the equipment. You can troubleshoot this issue by setting the gap between 0,060″ and 0,100″ for DC currents and 0,030″ to 0,060″ for AC currents. Make sure that the arrangement of the coil and the striker plate is parallel to each other., Often, the vibratory panel feeders show decline in the rate of feeding because of change in the hardness (durometer) of the rubber feet. Curing of rubber thanks to continuous usage can result in swelling or hardening of the feet. In order to maintain the feed rate of your equipment, you should replace the rubber feet as and when such a requirement arises., A cracked spring can not only decrease the feed rate of the equipment, it can also halt the overall process. The area adjacent to the holes of a spring is prone to cracks. You should inspect these cracks with the help of a magnifying glass. For clearer inspection, you can brush or polish the spring with the help of an emery cloth. A cracked spring should be replaced immediately., Bowl feeders are held with the help of toe clamps during the parts feeding process. If the clamps are loose, it can result in slow and irregular parts movement. You can easily troubleshoot this issue by tightening the toe clamps and ensuring that the bowl feeder is held in one place properly., Residual dirt, clogged dust, and other impurities adversely affect the working of a vibratory feeder. Make sure that you clean the bowl feeders, base plates, feeding trays, and other parts of the vibratory feeder in order to get better performance. 

check if the vibratory tray is mounted properly.  set the coil gap properly.  change the rubber feet.  check and replace cracked spring.  tighten the clamps that are holding the bowl feeder.  clean the bowl feeders, feeding tray, and base plate. 

 A great way to develop your own personal style is to explore the style of others. This will help you figure out your tastes — what you love, what you dislike, and what you’d like to try.   Fashion bloggers, celebrities, and designers are great people to look to when exploring fashion. Follow them on Instagram and Pinterest to keep track of their looks and interests.; , This can be online via sites like Pinterest or Clothia, or using a physical scrapbook, into which you could paste print-outs and magazine cut-outs.   You might organize your pages according to season (winter, spring), piece (jackets, dresses), or purpose (work, formal, casual).  As you explore fashion, consider whether a theme emerges when you look at your favorite items. Are you often choosing punky looking outfits? Maybe you’re more into a retro style like ‘70s rockstar or ‘50s pin-up, or maybe you’re more of a minimalist.   Think about what the things you like say about you, and about how you can express who you are through the things you wear. If you’re an outgoing actor who loves to dress up, you might wear bright colors and chunky accessories, for example.  As you start out it might feel overwhelming to put together a great outfit, and it may be tempting to just copy other people’s outfits. Try to keep your look more unique by doing variations on what you see elsewhere.   For instance, you might do the same silhouette but different colours or patterns, or the same colours and patterns, but a different silhouette. As an example, you could copy the popular look of wearing a high-waisted mini-skirt and a loose-fitting shirt with heels, but do the skirt, shirt, and shoes in different colors from the outfit you saw on someone else. You can also switch things up with accessories.  Ever seen those “who wore it better” photos? People rarely wear the same clothes in the same way. In addition, they’ll often pair their clothes with different hairstyles and accessories.One person might wear a loose-fitting blouse untucked over skinny jeans with a pair of thigh-high boots, while another person might wear the same blouse tucked into the same skinny jeans, with their sleeves rolled up and a pair of chunky ankle boots.  Stylish people can put together great outfits no matter what store they’re in. Don’t limit yourself to the big brand stores. Check out thrift, vintage, and discount shops to see if you can find any treasures.A popular thing to do nowadays is to consider the corporate ethics of the stores that you shop in. It can make it a bit more difficult to purchase cheap, stylish clothes, but if you’re politically and environmentally conscious then it’s something you’ll want to consider before entering a store.  It’s important to step outside of your comfort zone and try new things, but don’t do so at the expense of your self-confidence. Only wear what makes you feel like the best version of yourself.  Confidence is as important to style as what you’re wearing. Ever heard the saying “don’t let the clothes wear you”? If you lack confidence, you might not be able to pull off the stylish clothes that you love.   Work on feeling good about yourself no matter how you look, and no matter what hangups you may have about your body.  Style experts build their closets around a few key pieces — all in neutral colors — that can be combined to make the majority of their outfits.Nearly all of them list the same basic pieces:Slim-legged black slacks Dark blue skinny jeans Pencil skirt in a neutral color (black is the most popular) Little black dress in whatever shape best fits your body type  A white, long-sleeved button-down dress shirt A soft crew-neck sweater (cashmere is popular but expensive) in a neutral color V-neck t-shirts in neutral colours like white, grey or black Basic black pumps Ankle boots in black or brown Nude or black ballet flats A black blazer A beige or black trench coat A black or neutral colored motorcycle jacket, Narrow your style down to a set of silhouettes that suit your body. This will help focus your choices and make it easier to buy new clothes and put together outfits.Once you know what you look best in, stick to that silhouette and buy variations on it. Your silhouette might be tight pants with chunky boots and loose-fitting tops, or high-waisted skirts and dainty heels.  When buying clothes, shoes, and accessories keep in mind how you spend your days. This will ensure that you actually wear what you buy.A teacher will need a completely different wardrobe (i.e. maybe slacks, pencil skirts, sweaters and flats) than a hostess at a fancy restaurant (i.e. perhaps cocktail dresses and heels), for instance.  Remove everything that doesn’t match your current style tastes. If something doesn’t fit you properly, donate it or have it tailored.Make sure that you feel great in everything that’s in your closet.   Be brutal as you choose what to keep and what to get rid of. Anything that you don’t feel great in is just taking up space and making it more difficult for you to put together stylish outfits.  Belts, handbags, and statement necklaces are a great way to spice up your classic clothing pieces.Take a little black dress from day to night by switching your flats for heels, and adding a big statement necklace.  Earrings and necklaces aren’t the only things you can use to boost your style.   Cinch in your waist and add a retro look to a plain little black dress by combining it with a vintage brown belt and handbag. Wide-brimmed hats have enjoyed popularity for a while now. They’re a great way to dress up most outfits, and are often seen paired with maxi dresses or skinny jeans and blazers. Just be careful not to wear the hat on a windy day!  , Generally big aviators and cat’s eye sunglasses have been popular over the past few years, but you need to choose what looks best on your face.   Stand at a sunglasses rack and try on all the different styles. Who knows? Maybe you look best in a pair of small circular sunnies like John Lennon wore.  If you’re worried about what colors to go with, start with a neutral palette like black, grey, beige, and white, and then incorporate a few punchy items as you go.   As an example, you could buy a vibrant green blouse to go with your black pencil skirt and black blazer, or a chunky, colorful statement necklace to complement that little black dress and heels.  Monochromatic outfits, or outfits all in one color, can be really eye-catching. Try putting together an outfit in all one color — popular choices are red or white, but really it depends on what looks best with your skin and hair.All black is a safe bet (although maybe a bit too safe!) and can go easily from casual to chic., Classic fashion advice is to go minimalistic on the clothing and silhouettes and then amp them up with accessories.As an example, you might punch up a plain, loose-fitting black shirt, black skinny jeans and black chunky ankle boots with a chunky gold chain necklace necklace and diamond (or diamond-like) ear studs. Or you might wrap a colorful scarf around your neck and wear a pair of silver hoops.Some people say that adding accessories to an outfit is like seasoning a meal, which is a great way to think about accessorizing.Adding an unexpected accessory that doesn’t obviously go with your outfit can give it an extra punch — for example, a chunky watch and spiky ear studs with a classic, feminine cardigan and fitted pencil skirt., Show off those long legs, accentuate that small waist or full bust, or choose a color that makes your eyes pop (or do all three!). Whatever you like best about your body, choose things that show that off.  As an example, you might make your legs look a mile long with a miniskirt or skinny jeans and heels in the same color, or you might wear a lovely blue-grey scarf to draw out your blue-grey eyes.  Leave that shirt partly untucked, or wear a pair of casual shoes with dressy slacks and a blazer. Looking too put together might make you look like you’re trying too hard, which can make you look less stylish.  Stylish people always look stylish, whether they’re in their pyjamas, having low-key hangouts with friends, or out for a night on the town.   With the right styling, you can look stylish even in skinny jeans and a T-shirt. As an example, you might pair black skinny jeans and a simple white V-neck T-shirt with a grey scarf, charcoal ankle boots, a black blazer, and silver hoop earrings.  Having great-looking hair, eyebrows, skin, and nails will immediately boost your stylishness by making you look more put together.  No matter what you wear, make sure you feel comfortable in what you’re wearing. This will immediately boost your stylishness by making you look at ease in what you’re wearing.   Heels won’t matter if you look like you’re drunk or injured while you try to walk in them.

 A poem might start as a snippet of a verse, a line or two that seems to come out of nowhere, or an image you cannot get out of your head. You can find inspiration for your poem by doing writing exercises and using the world around you. Once you have inspiration, you can then shape and mold your thoughts into a poem.For example, you may using a writing prompt to do a freewrite. You could then use lines or images from the freewrite as the inspiration for your poem. You can use an existing writing prompt or create your own writing prompt. You could try brainstorming techniques like mind mapping or making lists of images or ideas. These techniques can help you generate inspiration for your poem.  You may also be inspired by going for a walk in your neighborhood or to your favorite spot in the city. You may observe people on a park bench or in a public square and use moments from your observations as the inspiration for a poem.   You could try writing a poem about a person who is important to you in your life, such as your mother or your best friend. You could use the person as inspiration for your poem, expanding on their qualities and traits as an individual.  You can start your poem by focusing on a specific theme or idea that you find fascinating or interesting. Picking a specific theme or idea to focus on in the poem can give your poem a clear goal or objective. This can make it easier for you to narrow down what images and descriptions you are going to use in your poem.For example, you may decide to write a poem around the theme of “love and friendship.” You may then think about specific moments in your life where you experienced love and friendship as well as how you would characterize love and friendship based on your relationships with others. Try to be specific when you choose a theme or idea, as this can help your poem feel less vague or unclear. For example, rather than choose the general theme of “loss,” you may choose the more specific theme, such as “loss of a child” or “loss of a best friend.”  , Get your creative juices flowing by picking a form for your poem. There are many different poetic forms that you can use, from free verse to sonnet to rhyming couplet. You may go for a poetic form that you find easy to use, such as free verse, or a form that you find more challenging, such as a sonnet. Choose one poetic form and stick to that structure so your poem feels cohesive to your reader.You may decide to try a poetic form that is short, such as the haiku, the cinquain, or the shape poem. You could then play around with the poetic form and have fun with the challenges of a particular form. You may opt for a form that is more funny and playful, such as the limerick form, if you are trying to write a funny poem. Or you may go for a more lyrical form like the sonnet, the ballad, or the rhyming couplet for a poem that is more dramatic and romantic.  To get a better sense of what other poets are writing, you may look through examples of poetry. You may read poems written in the same poetic form you are interested in or poems about themes or ideas that you find inspiring. You may also choose poems that are well known and considered “classics” to get a better sense of the genre. For example, you may read:   “Kublai Khan” by Samuel Taylor Coleridge“Song of Myself” by Walt Whitman“I measure every Grief I meet” by Emily Dickinson“Sonnet 18” by William Shakespeare“One Art” by Elizabeth Bishop“Night Funeral in Harlem” by Langston Hughes“The Red Wheelbarrow” by William Carlos Williams , Avoid abstract imagery and go for concrete descriptions of people, places, and things in your poem. You should always try to describe something using the five senses: smell, taste, touch, sight, and sound. Using concrete imagery will immerse your reader in the world of your poem and make images come alive for them.For example, rather than try to describe a feeling or image with abstract words, use concrete words instead. Rather than write, “I felt happy,” you may use concrete words to create a concrete image, such as, “My smile lit up the room like wildfire.”  , Literary devices like metaphor and simile add variety and depth to your poetry. Using these devices can make your poem stand out to your reader and allow you to paint a detailed picture for your reader. Try to use literary devices throughout your poem, varying them so you do not use only metaphors or only similes in your writing.A metaphor compares one object or subject to another object or subject in a surprising way. For example, “I was a bird on a wire.” A simile compares one object or subject with another using “like” or “as.” For example, “She was as alone as a crow in a field” or “My heart is like an empty stage.” You can also try using literary devices like personification, where you describe an object or idea using human qualities or attributes. For example, “The car sank like a stone” or “My love is like a tornado in a jar.”  , Poetry is made to be read out loud and you should write your poem with a focus on how it sounds on the page. Writing for the ear will allow you to play with the structure of your poem and your word choice. Notice how each line of your poem flows into one another and how placing one word next to another creates a certain sound or rhythm to your poem.For example, you may notice how the word “glow” sounds compared to the word “glitter.” “Glow” has an “ow” sound, which conjures an image of warmth and softness to the listener. The word “glitter” is two syllables and has a more pronounced “tt” sound. This word creates a sharper, more rhythmic sound for the listener.  Your poetry will be much stronger if you avoid cliches, which are phrases that have become so familiar they have lost their meaning. Go for creative descriptions and images in your poem so your reader is surprised and intrigued by your writing. If you feel a certain phrase or image will be too familiar to your reader, replace it with a more unique phrase.For example, you may notice you have used the cliche, “she was as busy as a bee” to describe a person in your poem. You may replace this cliche with a more unique phrase, such as “her hands were always occupied” or “she moved through the kitchen at a frantic pace.”  , Once you have completed a draft of the poem, you should read it aloud to yourself. Notice how the words sound on the page. Pay attention to how each line of your poem flows into the next. Keep a pen close by so you can mark any lines or words that sound awkward or jumbled.You may also read the poem out loud to others, such as friends, family, or a partner. Have them respond to the poem on the initial listen and notice if they seem confused or unclear about certain phrases or lines.  You can also share your poem with other poets to get feedback from them and improve your poem. You may join a poetry writing group, where you workshop your poems with other poets and work on your poetry together. Or you may take a poetry writing class where you work with an instructor and other aspiring poets to improve your writing. You can then take the feedback you receive from your peers and use it in your revision of the poem., Once you have received feedback on your poem, you should revise it until it is at its best. Use feedback from others to cut out any lines to feel confusing or unclear. Be willing to “kill your darlings” and not hold onto pretty lines just for the sake of including them in the poem. Make sure every line of the poem contributes to the overall goal, theme, or idea of the poem.You may go over the poem with a fine tooth comb and remove any cliches or familiar phrases. You should also make sure spelling and grammar in the poem is correct.  

do writing exercises.  get inspired by your environment and those close to you.  pick a specific theme or idea.  choose a poetic form.  read examples of poetry.  use concrete imagery.  include literary devices.  write for the ear.  avoid cliche.  read the poem out loud.  get feedback from others.  revise your poem. 

 If the chair is in an unusual shape or is heavily upholstered, it may not work with a standard slipcover. Searching for the type of furniture and the term “slipcover” in online forums may also work.; , Make sure to include the height, width and depth of the chair. Then, measure any additional parts, such as an ottoman.  Target, Walmart, Pottery Barn and Overstock sell a wide variety of slipcovers. You can get a slipcover with elastic bands that wrap around the bottom of the furniture.   This is best for upholstered chairs and sofas.  These are also available from home décor stores and they are designed to tie tightly to cover a chair. Consider purchasing cushion slipcovers separately so that you can create an upholstered look.   Remove the cushions. Tie the removable cushion covers on to each one separately. Arrange the slipcover over the chair, then begin to tuck it into the corners of the frame. Tie it where applicable. Push a large paper towel roll into the crevices of the chair. It will keep the slipcover tucked in. Buy twist pins in order to form pleats with the slipcover and hold them in place. Replace the covered cushion on top of your customized slipcover., These are specially designed to fit over a standard dining room chair and tie at the back. They are good for everyday use or to dress up a home for special events.   Good dining chair covers can cost between $30 and $200.  You can wrap the sheet under the base and pin it with twist pins or a nail gun.  

contact the company who made the furniture to see if they suggest a certain type of slipcover.  measure your chair to see if you can find a slipcover that will work.  look for slipcovers from décor and box stores.  opt for a one-size-fits-all chair slipcover.  purchase dining chair covers from wedding supply stores or home décor stores.  use a patterned sheet if you need to cover a chair quickly.

 Oxford and Cambridge are great places to study and look very good on a CV. One in five member of the Parliament actually went to Oxbridge!In a few cases, you may wish to consider top universities overseas, or another university for a specialist degree (e.g. Mechanical Engineering). You might also want to study in another European country to enjoy other cultures or learn a language.   Make sure to visit Oxford and Cambridge. You can access the colleges and talk to the students. You can also contact the universities and colleges through their webpages or by phone. Don't send emails to the lecturers and professors. They don't deal with general queries and are already busy enough. If you haven't studied in the United Kingdom before, look at the criteria online or contact the admission teams. They have very specific criteria for each country on the planet. ; , Your A-Levels will determine if you are admitted or not. As a teenager, you will be expected to work over 40 hours a week for some subjects, so make sure you are willing to dedicate yourself to the hard work.   Your A-Level results are extremely important. If you feel you will be able to achieve highly when taking more than three A-Level results, then feel free to do so. However, the number of results is far less important than the grades. It is better to do better with three A levels (at least AAA or higher, dependent on course and university), than to do less well with four or more. Most Admissions Tutors will agree with this. It is not mandatory to disclaim your GCSE grades but they are often used to distinguish between entrants due to the high number of A's achieved at A level. As they are not mandatory, there is officially no level to reach. In practice, the better they are, the more likely you are to be accepted.  Your choice of A-Levels needs to reflect your desire to study a discipline. You cannot study medicine if you never had an interest in science. It’s always a good idea to check in advance what is needed in your aspiring field.  It's also a great idea to make sure you are passionate about your subject, don't just do it for Oxbridge, for a job or because you are good at it. You will be slogging it out for the next three or more years, make sure It's something you can enjoy. The interviewer will also be looking out for this passion.  Think ahead. Your degree will decide what you do in life. You should realise that you might not work in history, even if you have a degree in the field. Decide what’s right for you and don’t let others choose for you.  Many applicants will have perfect grades at GCSE and A-Levels. When all else is equal, depending on what program you're in, Oxbridge may look at your life and at who you are to decide who has done the extra mile.   Gain leadership experience. Having responsibilities and the ability to lead a team is always a way to shine. Try to become the captain of your sport team or the president of your debating club. Volunteer with charitable organizations. Helping others and showing that you care about your surrounding will make you look like a valuable addition to a community. Engage with cultural activities. Oxbridge is based on traditions and history. Even if you want to study science, show that you care about the past and the culture. Ultimately though, extra-curricular activities are not the be-all and end-all. The people reviewing your application will be academics, so it is much more important to show a genuine passion for your subject and to back up your claims with evidence. This can include listing relevant books you have read, films or documentaries you have watched, or events you have attended.  It might be obvious but you need to know where you want to study when you apply. There is a strong rivalry between the two universities and you probably already have a preference. The most rational way to pick the right institution for you is by picking the strongest in your field. Oxford performs far worse in engineering and technology than Cambridge but is better for life sciences, medicine and humanities.It is slightly easier to reach Cambridge from London. Think about the financial implication. The tuition fees are currently £9,000 per year and you should allow an additional £8,300 per year to live in Cambridge.. Oxford is slightly more expensive in terms of living costs.  You will need to pick a college when you apply and write the application. Read up about as many colleges as you can. You can view the statistics of each college online to see how many people applied and got in for each course. Study the history of the college and try to remember the name of a few of its prominent members. It’s important to show that you care.   Make sure to choose a college that offers your subject. You can find information on this on the University websites. Only take an open application if you are unsure what college you want to go to. This will not affect your chances but you will be asked why you didn't apply for a college at the interview. Make sure to underline that it has nothing to do with you not caring or not having read on them.  Oxbridge will only look at your personal statement for a few minutes. It has to be perfect. Ask several teachers to look over it and even get your friends to double-check. Make sure to take the advice of experienced teachers. There are many ways to approach a personal statement but make sure to mention the following in your letter:   Introduction about the subject, why you want to do it, etc. (show some knowledge of the course) Academic achievement Non academic achievement Extra curricular activities and hobbies Conclusion (include what you want to do after university).  There are extra steps between the UCAS and the interview at the University of Oxford. The first one is a test with the Admissions Testing Service.The test is not systematic. It is required when you need specific knowledge, like Latin and Greek for Classic studies. A full list and several examples of tests are available on the webpage of the University of Oxford.Each test is different. Make sure to read what's required and the criteria about your specific discipline.  You will need to submit written work. The piece needs to be marked and cannot be more than 2,000 words. Make sure to select the best written work you can.The written work should be relevant to your future career path. Don't send a history essay if you want to study biology.  If you are called for an interview, you will need to prepare. They will ask you difficult questions and try to test you. You must prove your knowledge and your desire to learn in that particular university. They will also ask you about your hobbies. Remember that they are looking for human beings who can contribute to the life of the college.   Know why you want to go to the college, why you want to study your course, and what you love about your course. Stay confident throughout the interviews. It is always a bonus to search up your interviewers to see the areas they specialise in. Read up on these areas as it may be likely that they will ask you questions on those topics. It is always better to be clued up, and you will impress them. There are courses held every year for students to prepare for the interview. These are extremely expensive, sometimes costing hundreds of pounds. They are not necessary if you are supported by your school and trained by your teachers. It is a good idea to get teachers to give you several different styles of mock interviews. Make sure you study relevant topics and be prepared to answer questions that require independent thought. Don’t forget to dress properly and behave impeccably. The first impression counts a lot. However make sure that you feel comfortable in your clothes, this may seem minor but it could affect your performance in the interview which is by far the most critical part of this process. Whether to wear a suit or not is an ambiguous subject. Some tutors may dress much more casually than others (this may have a correlation with which subject they teach). The letter or email inviting you to the interview may hold a hint on what kind of clothes are acceptable.  Oxbridge will typically notify you of their decisions six months before your final A-Levels. If you get accepted, you will still have to perform well at your A-Levels as the offer will be conditional on you receiving certain grades. The typical Oxford offer is AAA at A-level, but Cambridge offers usually asks for the new A* grade.   If you are rejected, you will need to consider your options. If you want to try the year after, make sure to do something constructive, such as volunteering, during your gap year. You can also choose to apply for another university.  

decide if oxbridge is right for you.  decide if you are willing to commit yourself early.  decide what you want to study at university.  consider rounding out your application with extracurricular activities.  choose between cambridge and oxford.  choose your college.  write an excellent personal statement and ucas application.  take the test (oxford only).  submit your written work (oxford only).  shine at the interview.  secure your place. 

 There is nothing wrong with buying a gift from the store, but the thought and time that goes into making a gift for someone can really say “I love you.” Think about things that are special in your relationship to incorporate into a gift. It can be something as simple as framing pictures from a vacation, or as involved as building your partner a piece of furniture. This is an instance where the thought really does count., Maybe your partner had a favorite toy when they were growing up, or they love a certain brand of honey that isn’t available where you live. Go out of your way to try and find a special something for your loved one and they will really appreciate the effort. Not only are you giving them a gift, but you are also showing how well you know them and how much you listen to them., While each partner should contribute in any kind of relationship, you shouldn’t expect the immediate reciprocation of a gift. With holidays like Christmas or anniversaries as exceptions, your partner may not even know that you intend to give a gift. Allow them to appreciate you and give them time to put back into the relationship.  

make your partner a gift.  give them something that they can’t find easily.  give gifts freely.

 You can buy a new stepladder, or you can use a ladder you have lying around. Measure the ladder and the place you plan to store your tree house. If you are using an old ladder, clean it thoroughly before bringing it into your home. You might want to paint your ladder a cheerful color.   Add boxes. Lash or glue a box or two to some of the steps. Add a pillow. You may want to string up a sort of hammock between the sides of your ladder and put a pillow on it for your cat to sit. If your cat doesn't like rocking, fix a piece of wood or a platter between the rungs. Make sure your ladder is balanced. If your cat or cats are sitting on one side, your ladder should not fall over or collapse on them.  Pick a bookcase you are not using, or buy a new one. If it is sturdy enough to stand on its own, you do not have to modify it much. Otherwise, use furniture straps to tie it to the wall. Cut holes in each shelf large enough for your cat to slink through. Cut carpet squares to fit each shelf, and fix them in place with glue, nails, or staples.   Buy a low-pile carpet to discourage your cats from chewing it. Cut the carpet into squares or rectangles to fit the shelves.  Sturdy shelves can be fixed to your walls in "steps" or zig-zags for your cats to climb. Measure your cat's reach and leave the right amount of space for your cat to get from shelf to shelf. Attach cloth or carpet squares to the shelves so your cats can get a grip on them. Add a pillow to one or two of the shelves for cat comfort.   Glue, nail, or staple everything you are putting on the shelves, as your cat may knock them off otherwise.  

build a stepladder cat tree.  convert a bookcase.  buy wall shelves for your cats. 

 Coconut milk is high in fat, fiber, and nutrients like vitamin E that make it excellent for moisturizing hair. Combined with the super-moisturizing power of extra virgin olive oil and the acid of lemon juice, this mask will help relax hair.People with artificially colored hair should avoid using lemon juice on their hair, as it will cause color to fade more quickly.  In a separate bowl, mix 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) cornstarch with 4 tablespoons of lemon juice until a smooth slurry forms.  Over medium heat, whisk the mixture constantly until it thickens. Once it reaches the consistency of a bottled conditioner, remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.  You can use a pastry brush or a paintbrush to make application easier, or just use your fingers to work the mask evenly throughout your hair. Make sure your hair is coated thoroughly with the mask for best results.  If you don’t have a shower cap handy, you can also wrap your hair with plastic wrap. Wrapping your hair will help it retain heat, which will assist in relaxing curls.  If you have a hairdryer, use it on the low setting until hair is warm. Alternately, you can warm a damp towel in the microwave and wrap the warm towel around your hair.  Avoid shampoos that have heavy surfactants or sulfates, as they will roughen your hair’s cuticles and undo the moisturizing and smoothing action of the mask. Follow with a deep conditioner.  Use progressively finer combs to completely detangle and gently stretch your hair.          Coconut milk is different from coconut water (which is thinner) and cream of coconut (which is sweetened and thickened). Make sure to purchase the right stuff! This mask will relax and loosen curls, but if you have very curly hair it may not entirely straighten your hair. However, the extra moisture provided by the mask will also help protect your hair if you use heat appliances.  

gather your ingredients.  whisk together 1 cup coconut milk and 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) extra virgin olive oil in a medium saucepan.  whisk the slurry into the coconut milk mixture.  distribute mask throughout hair.  cover your hair with a shower cap.  apply heat.  wash with gentle shampoo and warm water.  comb straight. 

 There are several cost-effective choices for neutralizing chlorine bleach (commonly sold under the brand name Clorox), which is the kind used in washing and for decorating or changing the color of fabric products. It also contains sodium hydroxide (lye) to stabilize the hypochlorite. The lye is difficult to rinse out completely and will slowly destroy cotton. To fully neutralize the lingering effects of chlorine bleach the hypochlorite and the lye must be neutralized, too. If you’re using bleach for decorative effects on cotton, denim, or other natural fabrics, you can try one of these options:   Bisulfite/metabisulfite is very inexpensive. It is sold under the brand name Anti-Chlor, and you only need to use a small amount to neutralize bleach. You can usually find bisulfite at dye suppliers or you can get Camden Tablets (which have the same ingredient) from a wine brewing supply company.Thiosulfate, which is called Bleach Stop, can typically be found at a local photography supply store, as it is commonly used in developing photographs. This is a more expensive option than bisulfite, and it’s not as strong so you’ll need to use more.Hydrogen peroxide is the most easily obtainable of the three neutralizers; you can find it at drugstores and grocery stores. This is an inexpensive choice, and it works well for people with asthma, who may be sensitive to the other compounds, which contain sulfur. Opt for the 3% solution.; , The amount of neutralizing agent required will depend on which one you’ve chosen.   Anti-Chlor: use 1 teaspoon per quart of water.Bleach Stop: 1 ounce by weight (30 grams) per gallon of water.Hydrogen peroxide: 1 part hydrogen peroxide to 10 parts water.Vitamin C/Absorbic acid: Absorbic acid neutralizes both the hypochlorite and the lye. You will find it in most food stores or pharmacies under its common name, vitamin C. Yes, get the cheapest vitamin C you can find and grind the tablets up into powder to dissolve in your rinse water. You may not know the exact quantity of ascorbic acid to use, because you almost certainly won't know exactly how much sodium hypochlorite and sodium hydroxide you are neutralizing. Just use plenty and rinse the excess out along with the products of the neutralizing chemical reaction. If some remains, it will certainly smell better than any of the sulphites or thiosulphate.  Following the directions on the bottle, use the bleach to achieve the desired effect/shade on your fabric.  Before you use your neutralizer, you want to rinse the fabric well with warm water to remove all of the bleach.Fill your bucket or stationary tub with rinse water ‘‘before’’ you begin bleaching.This way, you can be sure to get the bleach off your fabric as soon as necessary so you don’t remove more than the desired amount of color.  Soak your fabric in the neutralizing agent mixed with the appropriate amount of warm water. Depending on the size of the fabric item(s) you may want to use a bucket or a stationary tub. It may or may not be cost-effective for you to do your neutralizing in the washing machine.   Whatever neutralizing agent you use, the quantity needed depends upon the quantity of bleach remaining in the material that has been bleached, not the amount of water. Fabric should soak in the neutralizer for about 10 minutes.  Wash your neutralized fabric in warm water with laundry detergent and rinse well.  

buy a neutralizing agent.  measure your neutralizing agent.  bleach your fabric.  rinse the fabric.  soak bleached fabric in neutralizer.  wash and rinse. 

 This cat has short hair that doesn't tangle or mat, and therefore, it doesn't need daily brushing. Brushing once a week is usually enough. Brushing the cat helps remove dead hair so that your cat doesn't ingest it.In springtime, you may have to brush the cat more often as it is getting rid of its winter coat.You'll only need to bathe this cat if it gets dirty.; , Brushing a cat's teeth is not as difficult as it sounds. You'll need to start by getting a cat-specific toothbrush and toothpaste. You shouldn't use your own toothpaste, as some ingredients may be poisonous to cats.Your cat isn't going to like the idea at first. Begin by lifting its lips and just touching the gums. You can use your finger, the toothbrush, or a cotton swab. Do this action a couple of times a day to get your cat adjusted to the idea. Move on to the toothpaste. Let your cat smell it or lick it. It should be a flavor the cat likes. Put some on the toothbrush, and apply it gently to the teeth. You may need a couple of sessions to get all of the cat's teeth., A cat's claws get too long and need regular trimming. Of course, most cats don't love having their claws trimmed, but if you make it a regular practice, it won't be too bad for you or the cat.To get your cat used to the idea, start by just holding your cat's paws several times during the day. When it comes time to trim the claws, you may need to try several positions before finding one that works for you. For instance, you can hold the cat in the crook of your arm while trimming, or you can have the cat in your lap facing outwards. Sometimes, having another person can help. Be sure to only trim the tip of the nail. You'll see a pink nerve/blood vessel running through the nail. Don't clip that, as it's painful for the cat and will cause the nail to bleed. Be patient. It may take several tries to get every nail.  Your cat's ears will need to be cleaned but only when they get dirty. Look inside for wax and other debris buildup. If they're dirty, use a bit of cleaner (ask the vet) on a cotton ball, and rub it on the inside of the ear, moving it towards the tip to remove the wax., As with any pet, this cat should visit the vet regularly. Establishing a vet while your cat is still a kitten can help acclimate your cat to the process. Plus, most cats will not show symptoms of many diseases until they are advanced, so regular checkups help keep your cat healthy.  When picking out a food for your cat, look for foods that have protein (meat, fish, or meat byproducts) in the first few ingredients. Because cats are obligate carnivores, they primarily get their calories from meat.The food should also be about 20 percent fat and 25 to 30 percent protein.When picking out foods, get ones appropriate to each age. A kitten should eat kitten food, while a senior cat should have food formulated for it. The term "meat byproducts" can be off-putting. However, it's perfectly healthy for your cat to eat, as it is mainly things like fatty tissue and organs. It may have bone in it, as well, but it won't have feet or fur. If you're unsure what to pick, choose a food with a seal from the Association of the American Food Control Officials (AAFCO). This certification means the food is balanced for your cat's diet.  Obesity in cats can lead to health problems, and the Korat can suffer from this issue just like any cat. Your cat only needs 20 calories per each pound of weight to stay the same size. Therefore, a 7 pound cat only needs 140 calories a day to stay the same weight. When thinking about calories, don't forget to consider any treats you feed your cat.To put your cat on a diet, lower the cat's intake by 40 calories a day.  Cats are clean creatures, and they prefer to have a clean litter box when using the bathroom. You wouldn't like to wade through sewage to use the bathroom, and your cat feels the same way. Try to scoop the litter box once a day if you have clumping litter, and change the whole thing once a week or every other week. For clay litter, you may need to change it out a couple of times a week., A health guarantee is important anytime you're buying a specialized breed like the Korat. However, it's especially important with Korats, as they have a genetic disposition to GM-1 and GM-2 gangliosidosis, which is a fatal condition. This disease can be tested for in the parents, which is why a health guarantee is important. When buying a cat from a breeder, ask for the health guarantee before finishing the purchase., On average, Korats have lower body fat than other cats. For the most part, that will not present a problem. However, if your cat needs anethesia, the vet may need to adjust how much the cat gets due to this issue., These cats often attach themselves to a single person, though sometimes they divide between two people. They tend to follow their "person" around, often wanting attention. They won't ignore other people; they just have a preference for a certain person. In other words, expect an affectionate cat, and be prepared to be affectionate back., Because these cats are so affectionate, they need a lot of attention. If you expect to leave the cat home alone during the day, providing animal companionship, such as another cat (particularly a Korat), will help keep this cat happier., These cats are smart and energetic, and they love to play when they aren't cuddling. Puzzle toys are a great option for these cats, the kind that will release treats as they play. Of course, other small toys and lure toys you use to play with the cat are also good options.You can also probably teach this cat to play fetch., Generally, these cats prefer a quiet environment. They aren't skittish exactly, but if there are too many loud sounds, these cats will likely hide for a while. That being said, they do usually like children, even with the noise. 

brush the cat once a week.  brush its teeth.  trim the cat's nails twice a month.  clean the cat's ears as needed.  visit the vet regularly.  pick a quality food.  give the cat an appropriate amount of food.  clean the litter box regularly.  ask for a health guarantee.  be aware of a korat's body fat percentage.  provide human companionship.  consider animal companionship.  have toys on hand.  give the cat a calm environment. 

 The bulk of leptospirosis prevention focuses on limiting your dog’s exposure to the environments where leptospirosis is likely to be lurking. Leptospirosis is often transmitted through stagnant bodies of water where infected wild animals have urinated or defecated.Keep your dog on a leash when walking or hiking in high risk areas, like marshy land or around stagnant ponds so that he doesn’t drink standing water. Don't allow your dog to drink or swim in standing water. When your dog is outside, provide fresh clean water and change his water regularly to prevent his drinking water from becoming infected. You should also keep your dog away from raw sewage. Keep your dog away from other dog’s feces and urine when you take him for a walk. Separate infected dogs from healthy dogs as well.; , Vaccinations are available that protect against the common leptospirosis strands.The initial vaccination is given to healthy dogs 10 weeks of age or older followed by a booster three to four weeks later.The vaccination lasts for a year and should be boosted each year. These vaccines are only effective for the forms of leptospirosis which are more commonly found to cause disease symptoms in dogs. For the most part this will be adequate for the average dog. Vaccinations do not work immediately after the first vaccine. After the booster vaccine the dog will then have full protection against leptospirosis.  Another way to prevent leptospirosis is to remove or fix situations that might attract vermin to your property. Animals such as raccoons, skunks, opossums, and rodents can carry leptospirosis.Drain any stagnant water on your property. Stagnant water attracts vermin. Keep garbage cans covered so these animals won’t be tempted to search for food in the garbage can. Monitor bird feeders so they don’t attract these pests to your yard. Trap any bothersome creatures with a live trap and release far away from your home or consult an animal exterminator if you cannot get rid of them.  If your dog comes down with leptospirosis, you will need to keep in mind that he can spread leptospirosis to you or other animals. Put your infected dog in a separate room or area than other dogs.Make sure your other pets or family members don’t come in contact with the infected dog’s waste. If you have to handle the infected dog, make sure to wear gloves at all times. Wash your hands after coming in contact with the dog.  Dogs may pick up the bacteria from areas that haven't been disinfected. Properly cleaning any bodily fluids your pet sheds while infected can help reduce the risk of the bacteria spreading to other dogs.Be careful when handling your dog’s waste. Use gloves to pick up any stool. Make sure the dog only uses the bathroom in a spot that can be cleaned, like concrete. Don’t let the dog use the bathroom on the ground or dirt because the bacteria can soak into the ground and spread. Most common household disinfectants will kill the leptospirosis germ, so bleach or other disinfectants can be used to clean the bathroom area, dog kennel, and water and food bowls. Make sure to wash your hands well after touching the infected dog or his waste.  

limit your dog's exposure to high-risk environments.  get your dog vaccinated.  remove anything that attracts vermin.  isolate infected dogs.  disinfect any contaminated areas. 

 Don’t put on clothing that is bright and flashy. This will encourage people to look at you. The same goes for colorful hats or accessories. The more you seem like you want to be noticed, the more people will try to notice you. This does not mean that you must look boring. Simple clothing can be stylish!   This goes for makeup as well. Bold, brash colors can be replaced with duller tones.; , Try not to wear anything that seems to flout the chosen mores of your society. For example, don't show too much skin if you live in a strict, religious place. You need to figure out what is correct for the situation that you are in. For example, if you go to a nude beach, you will be stared at if you wear clothing.  Don’t draw attention to yourself. Certain conduct is going to always make people curious. For example, if you sing loudly in public, people will look at you. Therefore, don’t act in a way that makes you stand out.   Again, what is normal will be defined by the situation you find yourself in. So, if you are standing still in the middle of a loud concert, you can expect that people may look at you in an odd way.  

avoid colorful clothing.  dress properly.  behave normally. 

 A girl who doesn't talk and constantly flaps her arms may still be very capable of understanding what you are saying. Even if your loved one can't understand you, they still appreciate your confidence and trust in them.; , Be clear about your thoughts and feelings, and give occasional pauses so they have time to think and consider how to respond. Avoid exaggeration if they don't understand figurative speech well.   Don't force them to make eye contact or stop stimming when they listen. This can make it very difficult for them to concentrate.  If they are "zoned out," they might not realize that you want to talk, and might not hear a word you say. Say their name, and see that they look up or acknowledge you before you begin to talk.  Autistic people don't "do it on purpose", and they can't help many of their idiosyncrasies. They're not trying to annoy you or being intentionally difficult. They're doing the best they can with what they have, just like you are.  Some autistic people love to talk passionately about their special interests, or need to ask lots of questions before they feel that they understand. Usually, persistent questioning is an attempt to bond with you—they're hoping that you'll open up and they want to listen.   If you are feeling drained, or need to do something else, just politely explain that you are tired, or you need to go do something else. You have a right to set boundaries.  This can help them concentrate and stay calm. If their stimming is extremely distracting (e.g. their pacing is making you dizzy), ask them to switch to a different stim (e.g. rocking in a rocking chair while knitting).   For their hands, try providing stress balls, tangles, fidget toys, and craft materials such as beads or yarn. Active people may sit better on rocking chairs or exercise balls.  Some autistic people struggle to remember to do the most mundane things. Even a teenager or adult may benefit from having a list of things to do every morning, like "brush your teeth", "take a shower", et cetera.   Consider adding pictures to the list, especially if the person is young or has limited reading skills. The list can be hidden in a drawer if the person is embarrassed by needing it.  Include everything that goes on in a day. If the person is school-aged, include things like "leave for school", "get home from school", "do homework", "eat a snack", et cetera. Be sure to include free time!   Laminate the schedule so that you can write temporary changes with a marker. For example, write when somebody comes to visit, or when school is on vacation.  They can feel very disorienting and upsetting to autistic people, so introducing them gently is important. Give them as much time as possible to get used to it and understand it.   If a last-minute change must be made, write it on the schedule in dry-erase pen as soon as possible. Give them plenty of time to adjust and prepare for a change. Giving them multiple reminders will help them be emotionally ready. Don't plan surprises, even ones you that you think would be fun. Avoid surprise parties. Tell the autistic person if you plan to take them out to a restaurant, attend a carnival, or anything that's not routine for them.  This helps them see how today will be different from yesterday, especially from the weekends to weekdays.   If there are things that happen less than daily, remind the person of them the night before, again in the morning, and again if possible shortly before the event. This includes sports practices, math tournaments, and music or dance lessons.  For example, if the person has a baseball practice one day, plan something every day at that time. That way, the person won't be used to being home and having free time or studying at the time they go to baseball the one day.  Get together with the autistic person and brainstorm ways to make group outings more fun for everyone. This should include...   Minimizing upsetting or painful stimuli Avoiding negative stimuli How to escape from an overwhelming situation Self-calming strategies (deep breaths, counting, taking a break, etc.)  , A sweater that feels slightly scratchy wool to you could feel like a swarm of angry fire ants to them. Always try to accommodate their needs—turn down the volume, go somewhere else, or give them earplugs and white noise so they feel okay.   Never say "you can deal with it" or "it can't hurt that much." This teaches them to deny the fact that they are uncomfortable or in pain. This can be dangerous when they have a tangible medical problem, but end up suffering in silence, because they think that it must be nothing—that's what they were told when they had sensory issues that hurt just as much. Encourage to try things that are just slightly out of their comfort zone. For example, offer to add a tiny bit of spice to their favorite meal, to help them adjust to eating spicier foods. Keep it playful, and let them back out of it whenever they want. This helps their brain learn to process it, and it introduces new things in a safe and nonthreatening way.  The exercise will give them a way to channel their extra energy, and help with sleeping trouble. The process of exploring the outdoors will introduce them to sensory stimuli in a fun way, which will help them with sensory processing issues.   Some autistic people feel much calmer and more focused if they swing for 15 minutes every day.  Listen to them talk about it once in a while (e.g. the conversation on the car ride home can be about cats). Help them pick out books and movies from the library that feature their interests. Encouraging their passions will help build their self-esteem and focus, and teach them skills that could later result in a very successful career.   Consider this an opportunity to learn more about your child and practice your active listening skills.  Emphasize that it is okay to talk about their interest, and they don't need to feel ashamed or afraid of doing so. Discuss moderation and flexibility as goals. Model appropriate conversation skills and help them learn to understand boundaries.   It is okay to set boundaries and say "I'm a little tired out right now and need some alone time" or "I need to go do my homework now." You can also politely change the subject if it's been a while. For example, "I'd like to talk about something else now. It's very nice to discuss computers with you, but I'm getting a little tired of it for now, so I'd like to change the subject. How was your day at school?"  , Some autistic children will wander off or leave the house. If you're in a crowded place like an amusement park, hold their hand or keep them in your sight. For children at home, lock the door with a deadbolt higher than they can reach.   Discuss safety in public places with them. Talk with them about what to do if they feel upset or need you. Teach them to go to their calming down corner instead of leaving the building, and to call you or tell an adult instead of wandering off to go find you. If they tend to wander, then consider making them a bracelet with your home address and phone number, so people can contact you if they find your child.  Autistic people are at higher risk of developing anxiety disorders, so it's important that they feel rested and balanced. Let them engage in their special interests, read books or play with toys on the floor, run around outside, and spend time doing quiet and relaxing activities. This will help prevent meltdowns, and increase their coping skills.  Network with therapists, teachers, and special education teachers.   If your family member is in school, talk to their teachers before the year starts, and explain their special need. If the autistic person is afraid of a particular adult, or hates attending a specific therapy, cut contact. Some therapists use harmful restraint and seclusion tactics, silence stimming, or undermine the child's autonomy. The person's emotional health will be better if you quit right away. If you wouldn't feel comfortable with a certain therapy being done to a non-autistic child, don't do it to an autistic child.  Your family member can meet other autistic people and share coping strategies, while you can learn tips from other family members.   Beware of anti-autism groups, which tend to lure parents with an ideology of martyrdom and treat autism like a scourge to be eliminated. This is harmful to the child, because it treats them like a project, burden, or list of behaviors, instead of a worthwhile human being. The autistic community considers some of these groups to be hate groups, and organizes campaigns against them.  The autism community online is a good place to start. Look up organizations run by autistic people, and autistic bloggers who share their stories. The hashtags #askanautistic and #actuallyautistic are good ways to find people on the spectrum.  Autism is a part of who they are, and a part of who they'll always be. It comes with plenty of challenges, but also idiosyncrasies—the way they flap their hands when they're happy to see you, their openness about their thoughts, or their quirky sense of humor. Learn to see their strengths and positive traits.  They are doing their best, and a disability does not make them an incomplete human being or a puzzle that's missing some pieces. Your unconditional love is what they need the most.  

assume that they are competent and intelligent.  speak clearly to help them understand.  make sure that you have their attention before you launch into something important.  remember that you're not the only one getting frustrated.  don't get mad at them for their communication attempts.  let them stim while they talk to you.  make lists.  make a schedule.  handle changes with care.  create a weekly schedule to help the person visualize weekly events.  try to keep each day similar to the rest.  discuss sensory overload and meltdown management strategies ahead of time.  listen to them when they tell you that something hurts or is difficult.  give them plenty of exercise and time outdoors.  make time for their special interests.  teach them to speak about their interests in moderation.  stay with them.  give the autistic person plenty of downtime.  build a team of caring adults to help your child learn and grow.  find support groups, for both the family member and yourself.  try to learn as much about autism as you can.  appreciate their quirks.  love and accept them. 

 It's important to know what characters look like, but how a character thinks, talks or moves can leave an even more powerful impression. Think of Sherlock Holmes. His defining features are that he is ridiculously smart, doesn't like other people, and is a bit of a drug addict. When establishing a character try:Using other character's reactions to convey information, e.g., "The conversation ceased as Esmeralda entered the room. Every eye fixed on her." Use a character's history to convey his or her qualities: "His appetite was legendary. It was said he had once eaten an entire boar in one sitting." Or, "He had once gone a year without uttering anything beyond 'yes, sir', 'no, sir', or 'I should think not, sir.'" Focus on a character's movement rather than his or her appearance, e.g., "She moved with the grace of a dancer." If you are going to discuss appearance, don't describe everything. Pick a particular defining feature: "Vic's a square-set, ready-and-steady sort of bloke, the sort of bloke who rubs his hands together at the start of something. His hands are always clean." (Graham Swift, Last Orders)  , The most powerful characters are often defined by the way they talk or think, like Balram Halwai, the hero of Aravind Adiga's The White Tiger. His voice is smart and humorous and alive: "Out of respect for the love of liberty shown by the Chinese people, and also in the belief that the future of the world lies with the yellow man and the brown man now that our erstwhile master, the white-skinned man, has wasted himself through buggery, cell phone usage, and drug abuse, I offer to tell you, free of charge, the truth about Bangalore."  , You don't need to go on and on to create a vivid picture. Doing so will only slow down your story. Instead, focus on a few key details and let the reader fill in the rest.   Few writers do this better than Erik Morgenstern in The Night Circus, a book filled with dizzily clever, yet surprisingly compact descriptions, like this one of a fantastic clock: "The body of the clock, which has been methodically turning itself inside out and expanding, is now entirely subtle shades of white and grey. And it is not just pieces, it is figures and objects, perfectly carved flowers and planets and tiny books with actual paper pages that turn."  , For many books – particularly historical fiction – the setting is almost another character. Yet when describing a real place – say 19th century France – you don't want to drown the reader in details. Instead, choose a few to give a sense of place, e.g., the small circles of light thrown by the gas lamps, illuminating sections of paved street; the smell of freshly-baked bread mixing with the stench of the Seine; the chiming of bells from a hundred churches.   Sprinkle in place names to give a sense of place. Instead of "the river", "the Seine." Instead of a broad square, the "Place de la Bastille." Foreign words can also create a sense of place, if sprinkled judiciously throughout your text. James Clavell's Shogun, set in feudal Japan, does a fantastic job of this. "Hai" is used instead of "yes." "Tomodachi" for "friend." "Domo" for "thank you."  , Sometimes, the key detail is what is not there.A woman might enter a ball in a fabulous dress with a smile on her face, but no joy in her eyes. A forest might feature towering oaks and lush undergrowth, but no birdsong or animal calls, not even the buzzing of insects. Remember that what is not there can sometimes reveal more than what is there.   Erin Morgenstern's The Night Circus, again, provides a great example of description through absence. In introducing the circus, he defines it through what it lacks: color. "The towering tents are striped in black and white, no golds and crimsons to be seen. No color at all, save for the neighboring trees and the grass of the surrounding fields… Even what ground is visible from the outside is black or white, painted or powdered, or treated with some other circus trick."  

move beyond physical appearance with characters.  use voice to create character.  keep descriptions of settings and objects short.  use real place details judiciously.  describe through absence. 

 In order to raise a well-rounded child you should foster and encourage the development of empathy. Studies have shown that well-liked kids have higher levels of empathy and can better understand the perspectives of other children. Empathy is the ability to value, respect, and understand the views of another person, even if you disagree. Here are a few suggestions for developing empathy in your child:Model empathy: Demonstrate that you empathize with your child. When you treat other people like they matter, your kids will pick up on this and mimic your actions. Spend time caring for others. Demonstrate that you are caring and compassionate on a daily basis. Allow your child to practice being empathetic. For example, provide them with opportunities to listen to others, ask them about conflicts at school and have them think about the experiences of their classmates. Apologize when you are wrong. Your child should learn how to take responsibility if they have done something wrong. Show them how to apologize and admit when they have wronged someone else.  Eating dinner each night is an excellent way to demonstrate the importance of strong communication, and it provides a perfect opportunity to learn about your child’s day. You can show an interest in their life by asking: “How was your day?”, “Do you have any assignments coming up?”, “What was your favourite part of your day?” etc.   These types of conversations can help teach your child how to ask questions and show interest in the lives of other people and will help develop their social skills.  It is important to foster the development of peer groups and friendships. Ask their friends to come over for dinner or for a sleepover. This will help them with forming close friendships with peers and will demonstrate that you value social interactions.Allow your child to have unstructured play time with their friends so that they can use their imaginations and creativity to come up with activities. You could also take your child and their friend to see a movie or go to the mall. Ask your child prior to inviting a friend over what they would like to do with their friend. If they are unsure, you might encourage them to do an activity where they have to work together, such as a puzzle, a group craft project, or an imaginative game. Do not pressure your child to invite people over if they are shy. As long as they have a few friends, it is ok if they are introverted.  Take your child out to interact with a wide range of people, cultures, lifestyles, places, and environments. This will help teach your child how to work with people who are different from them as well as how to be flexible and open-minded. You can:  Travel to different parts of the country and world Take them to cultural festivals Visit museums, libraries, and zoos Volunteer as a family for an important cause Try new foods and cuisines together Go to the theater, a concert, or the ballet  

teach them empathy.  eat dinner together.  invite their friends over.  expose your child to diverse experiences. 

 It can be scary, but you need to be able to gauge exactly how much you have to do.; , Dedicate at least one hour a day to doing old homework, and you'll probably be caught up in at least a week.  Make a pact with yourself not to get any farther behind while you work on catching up. Set aside time every day to gather all upcoming assignments and make a detailed plan for how you will complete them. This is showing responsibility and will get you motivated to get caught up. This is also helpful so you don't get behind anymore.  Explain what may have lead you to fall behind and ask what you can do to get caught up. Your teacher may be able to connect you additional resources, like tutoring, check-ins, counseling, or other help.  Is anyone else having trouble? Who might be able to help you? It's worth it to put yourself on the line to get this extra support. You might realize that the class is hard for everyone, which can make you feel less alone.  Ask a teacher or a friend to tutor you after school or on weekends. This can get you caught up with everyone. This is really helpful if you're having difficulties in school or if you just need the extra help. Some schools even offer special tutors to help students.  There are many people out there who can give you the support you need to make it through a tough class -- parents, teachers, counselors, or even friends. Don't be ashamed about falling behind. It happens to everyone, and the important thing is that you are dealing with it now.  

make a list of what you've missed.  make a plan for how you're going to do this missed work.  hand in all upcoming work on time.  talk to your teacher.  talk to other students in the class.  try to get tutoring.  take every opportunity you can get for help. 

 Then, gently take him by the collar and move him from the garbage can. It is important to say ‘off’ when you see him going through the garbage can. If you do it after the fact, such as when you see him munching on food that he got from the garbage can, he will be confused as to why you are punishing him. That confusion may lead him to become fearful of you and your punishment.It may take several repetitions of you saying ‘off’ and clapping your hands before your dog learns not to dig through the garbage can.  An alternative way of giving this command is to say ‘off’ and then call him to you. Reward him with a treat when he comes to you.You can think of this as discouraging the bad behavior by distracting him with something more rewarding.   You may need to repeat this several times when you see him approaching the garbage can. Eventually, he will learn that walking away from the garbage can is more rewarding than walking towards it.  If you know what type of food he typically likes to scrounge for in the trash, place that food on top of the garbage can. Say ‘off’ and reward him when he comes to you. After several (or many) repetitions, your dog should eventually learn that he should walk from the garbage can, even when something very desirable is in it. 

clap your hands and say ‘off.’ if you catch your dog in the act of sifting through the garbage can, clap your hands and authoritatively say ‘off’ at the same time.  say ‘off’ without clapping your hands.  place a smelly food on top of the garbage can.

 Anyone can get hemorrhoids, but people with regular constipation almost always get them. Sitting on the toilet for long stretches and straining to push out hard, compacted stools is a “one-two punch” for hemorrhoid formation and discomfort.One of the easiest ways to battle constipation is to drink more water. Women are recommended to consume 9 cups (2.2 liters) of fluids daily and men are recommended to consume 13 cups (3 liters).Also, add more fiber to your diet. Eat more vegetables, fruits, and high-fiber grains like oats. Look at the side effects of any medications or supplements you are taking. Constipation may be caused by certain medications. Talk to your doctor about discontinuing or switching your medication if this is the case. Consider also using a fiber supplement or stool softener as well. Consult your doctor before undertaking any long-term regimen, however. Keep in mind that to most effectively avoid constipation, you will want to do a combination of these things. Increasing exercise, fluids, and fiber intake, as well as discontinuing any problematic medications, will all work together to ease constipation better than any one treatment done alone.  Regular, gentle cleaning and drying can help cool and soothe your hemorrhoids. Try, for instance, using pre-moistened (but fragrance-free) wipes instead of standard toilet paper, which tends to be more abrasive and clean less thoroughly.Shower or — preferably — bathe daily and gently clean the area with water alone. Pat the area dry or use a hair dryer on the lowest setting. You can also use a sitz bath, which is a basin that fits over your toilet bowl and allows you to soak and clean only the target area. Use clean, cool water and sit for 10 to 15 minutes, three times per day (or more as needed).  The range of treatments and medications available at any pharmacy provides a clear indication of just how common hemorrhoids are. Try various options and see what provides you with relief, but don’t use any hemorrhoid treatment for more than two weeks without clearing it with your doctor first.Hemorrhoid creams or ointments (such as a well-known “preparation”) can help shrink hemorrhoidal tissues and soothe itching and discomfort. Ointments or pads containing witch hazel may also be effective in dealing with itchiness and pain. On a more basic level, placing a wrapped ice pack or cold compress in your intergluteal cleft (or your "butt crack") can provide temporary relief from pain and inflammation. Pain-relieving medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen may also provide some measure of relief from hemorrhoidal discomfort.  If you have rectal itching and discomfort, can feel small protrusions outside your anus, and/or see small amounts of red blood when you defecate, you more than likely have hemorrhoids; however, in rare instances, more serious conditions ranging from anal fissures to internal bleeding to cancer may be the cause. The smartest choice is to see your doctor and verify that you are dealing with hemorrhoids, then discuss treatment options.While most hemorrhoids can be treated at home, some may require intervention by your doctor. Treatments can range from “banding” hemorrhoids so they wither and fall off to surgical removal (hemorrhoidectomy). The nature of your hemorrhoids, your level of discomfort, and many other factors will come into play as you and your doctor determine your best course of treatment.  

take action against constipation.  keep your “hemorrhoid zone” clean.  try topical treatments or medications.  consult your doctor. 

 One of the easiest ways to find villages in your existing game is to switch over to creative mode so that you can fly around until you find one. The process for switching modes varies depending on your version:   PC - Type /gamemode 1 in the chat window to switch your world to creative mode. You'll need to have cheats enabled to do this. Pocket - You'll need to load your level into an inventory editor app and use the tools to switch modes. Console - It is not possible to switch between survival and creative modes on the console editions of Minecraft.  Once you're in creative mode, you can start flying by pressing Jump twice. On your keyboard, press Space twice to start flying. On Pocket, double-tap the jump button.   Hold the jump button while flying to go up, and the crouch button to go down. Double-tap jump again to stop flying.  While you're flying, you can move very quickly across the world. Use your new skill to find biomes that support villages: plains, savanna, desert, and taiga (1.10+ only).   You can use this method in combination with the previous one to check multiple locations from the village finder utility much quicker than by exploring for each one on foot.  Villages can spawn anywhere in the biome, so search the whole area before moving on to a new location.  Once you've found a suitable village, you can switch your game back to survival mode and continue playing.   PC - Type /gamemode 0 in the chat window to switch back to survival mode. Pocket - Use the inventory editor tool to switch your world back to survival mode.  

open your survival map in creative mode.  start flying.  find some suitable biomes.  check the entire biome.  switch back to survival mode. 

   This is perhaps one of the most important first steps when it comes to preparing your skin for a spray tan. Dry, rough patches of skin tend to attract and hold more color than skin which is smooth and soft. Failing to exfoliate before spray tanning can result, therefore, in blotchy patches of dye on your elbows, knees, and other rough areas. Use a loofah or other type of exfoliating tool to scrub your entire body. A body scrub with sea salt or other exfoliating products also provides the optimum results.; ,   While excessive body hair will not impair the ability of the spray tan to stick to your skin, shaving soon after receiving a spray tan can be detrimental. In fact, shaving soon after this procedure often results in the color flaking off from your skin. As spray tans can be quite expensive, most individuals who receive them want to ensure their longevity. Avoid lotions, creams, deodorant, or other personal hygiene items that could interfere with the spray tan adhering to the skin. Many women and men enjoy applying lotion or moisturizer to their face and body to ensure soft, supple skin. To ensure the best results during a spray tan, refrain from using skin lotions and moisturizers until after having the spray tan done as these lotions often block the spray tan from sticking to your skin. The same applies to products like antiperspirant, deodorant, make-up, perfume, or powder as they too can block the adherence of the spray tan to your skin, resulting in blotchy coloration.    The spray tanning solution is likely to remain damp for awhile after you exit the tanning booth. While some individuals would prefer to remain in the nude until the solution dries completely, this is not an option for all. To prevent the solution from rubbing off onto your clothing, bring a selection of T-shirts and pants which are as loose as possible. In addition, as some brands of spray tan can stain clothing, consider bringing clothing which is black or another dark color.  

exfoliate your body.  shave unwanted hair.  bring the proper clothes. 

 If you've been invited on a picnic at the park at 3:00, don't show up at 3:30. Perhaps even show up a bit early.; , Don't try to impress them with a barrage of information about how you're a straight-A student, the MVP for your soccer team, and the lead in the school play. If the subject of grades, sports, or hobbies comes up, you can smile and say "Yes, I like school." or "I love to play soccer." or "Really? I love acting, too." You can also use your interests to segue into an invitation to another meeting. Offer to refresh their memory on physics or tutor their son; suggest shooting hoops together after dinner; or invite them to come and see the play. In summary, don't focus the conversation on you; ask about their interests.  Most parents love to see that their son has discovered a girl with a bit more to her than her looks. They like to know you aren't just a meek and mild thing draining their sons time. Whether having a meal with them or bumping into them when you turn up at his house, start a small simple conversation to show you're genuinely interesting.  It sounds a bit 'teacher's pet' but even the simplest things as laughing (not too over the top) at their jokes, gives the impression that your friendly and even against their will sometimes, they will start to like you.  No parent wants to see their precious son come home from school with his arm draped over a girl in a miniskirt, wedges, and a tube top exposing a "tramp stamp" (AKA: lower back tattoo.) This is not to say you should show up in a prairie dress, bonnet, and granny boots. Nice jeans, pressed khakis, or a mid-length skirt will do, as will a cute t-shirt, tank top, or even a nice dress. Also be sure you're not flashing a thong or that your bra straps are flapping about.  Swearing will not impress your boyfriend's parents. Nor will your talk of that "gnarly rave" you went to last night, or your "hilarious" story about that time you drew all over your friend's face whilst she was passed out drunk. However, your story about your cute dog or polite answers to their questions will.  It may sound simple, but parents will love it if you offer to help set or clean up dinner, make polite conversation, or at the very least just say please and thank you. Don't chew with your mouth open, help yourself to seconds, or dig into dinner before everyone has sat down. You may even consider bringing a small gift such as jam or cookies with you.  Use common sense. A slight peck on the cheek is OK, but nothing more.  Yes, it sounds totally cliché, but nobody wants their son going out with a totally plastic, "perfect" girl. They want him to be going out with a girl who is nice, who can help cook dinner some nights, or to shoot hoops with alongside their son. Really, just be you. Your boyfriend and your boyfriend's parents will love you for it.  

be on time.  be casual.  be chatty.  flatter them.  dress modestly.  speak nicely.  remember your manners.  the most important rule ever, please do not make out with your boyfriend in front of his parents.  be yourself. 

 Tailors, seamstresses, clothiers, and other garment makers generally use tape measures to get the correct measurements of a person when fitting for clothes or altering items. These portable, flexible tools are your best friend when it comes to measuring your pants.   When measuring with a tape measure, pull the tape taut, but don't stretch it. Clothing tape measures are often made of a soft synthetic material that can distort if stretched, resulting in inaccurate measurements. You can also use a plastic measuring tape that you might find in your toolkit. This type of tape measure isn’t as easy to use, but it will still bend, allowing you to measure curves.; , If you’re measuring your pants to figure out which style and size is right for you, it’s best to use a pair of pants that fit you properly. Ideally these pants will not be too worn out or stretched. The legs of the pants should also extend roughly to your ankle bone, or a little lower depending on preference.   Not all types of pants will have the same measurements. Grab a few different kinds of pants that fit you well. Dress pants will be slightly different than chinos, or jeans.  The easiest way to measure pants is to lay the pants on a flat surface. If you try to measure a pair of pants that you are wearing, you may not get the right measurements as you shift your body to see the measurements.   Your pants shouldn’t be too worn in so that you can get a realistic measurement. If the pants you are measuring are wrinkled, quickly smooth the fabric out with an iron. Measuring your pants is mostly the same for both men and women. However, sizing for men is typically represented by the length of the measurement in inches, whereas women’s sizes are typically represented by another number.  To get the most accurate measurement of your pant’s waist lay the pants flat on the floor. Smooth the pants out so there is no bunching. Don’t stretch the pants, though. Measure flat across the back waistband from one corner to the other. Double the number to get the actual waist size.         Make sure your pants are also facing up, with the front pockets facing the ceiling. If your pants are lying correctly, the front part of the waistband will be resting slightly below the back.  You may want to measure your actual waist, but also the waist of your pants to get an accurate size. To measure your waist, wear underwear or similar clothing that is well fitting. Make your measurement at your natural waist. This is at the thinnest portion of your body, between your ribs and your belly button. You can find your natural waist by bending to the side and seeing where your body creases. Wrap the measuring tape around your waist and record the measurement where the tape meets itself. Look at your measurement without bending. Use a mirror to help you.         Keep one finger between the tape and your body as you measure. This keeps you from drawing the tape too tightly. Resist the urge to draw your stomach in. Try to stand as you normally would, while still having proper posture. Keep the measuring tape parallel to the floor for an accurate measurement. If you are having a hard time finding where your waist is, wrap your hands around your stomach and squeeze slightly. Then, move your hands down until you feel the top of your hip bone. By measuring your waist and the waist of your pants separately, you can learn what your actual waist size is, and the actual size of your pant’s waistline as the two might be slightly different.  Measure across your pants at the base of the zipper. Make sure that you go to the edge of each seam. Once you’ve measured the front, double the number to get the whole measurement.          When measuring your pants on the floor, make sure to measure from the outer stitching of each seam.  Starting from the crotch, where the pieces of fabric in your pants intersect, draw the measuring tape down the inside of one leg and to the very bottom of the pant leg where it would naturally hang around your shoe. You can also wear a pair of pants and stand straight with your back against the wall to get another measurement for accuracy. However, this method works best if you have a friend to measure for you.         Note that inseams are usually measured to the nearest half-inch.Use a pair of pants that fit you well to get the most accurate measurement on your inseam. If you are measuring alone, tape the measuring tape to the inside of your heel, or the bottom of your pants (whichever you prefer) and then measure upwards. If the leg of your pants doesn't sit where you'd like it to (if you cuff your pants), measure to where you'd like your pair of pants to end.  To measure the front rise of your pants, start at the bottom center of the crotch seam and measure up to the top of the waistband. Rises usually range from 7 inches (180 mm) to 12 inches (300 mm).         Pants typically come in a regular rise, low rise, and high rise. Low sits below the waist, regular at the waist, and high above the waist. Note that the definition of the rise measurement varies. Some define the "rise" as the measurement extending from the back of the waistband down between the legs and up to the front of the waistband.  

use a measuring tape.  use a pair of pants that fit you well.  lay your pants flat on the floor.  measure the waist of your pants.  measure your actual waist.  measure the hips.  measure your inseam.  measure your front rise.

 If you are sending a physical letter, you will need the name of the person, business, or organization you are writing to (and their title, if applicable), their street address, the postal code, and location. You should also include the destination country, especially if you are writing from overseas. Write the information in the proper order, according to this model:Herr Dr. Tomasz Mann, Zeughofstrasse 23, 1121 Berlin, Deutschland  , Make sure to put your (the sender’s) address at the top left corner, formatted in the same way as the address of who you are writing to. Put the recipient’s address on the lower right., If you are sending a letter within or from Germany, you can contact Deutsche Post, visit their website, or stop by one of its offices for details about how to purchase postage and send your letter. If you are writing to Germany or another location, contact your local post office for information about how to deliver the letter. You may also have private shipping options from carriers like FedEx, DHL, and UPS., For the most part, the guidelines for writing a letter in German apply when sending an email or other electronic correspondence. Above all, pay attention to the distinctions between formal and informal writing. Even though email is instantaneous, it still pays to show courtesy and respect, especially when writing to people you don’t know. 

format the addresses.  put the addresses on the envelope or package.  mail your letter.  follow standard letter-writing conventions when sending an email. 

 Position it so that one corner is facing up and one is facing down.  You should have a triangle now that's half the size of the handkerchief.  Grab the tip of the bottom half you just folded up. Now fold it back down so that 2/3 of it has passed the halfway fold. You are only doing this two one layer. So at the top you should still see one whole triangle with another one folded down and sticking past the midline by 2/3s.  Grabbing the tip bring it back towards the top of the pocket square. Just as you did before, let about 2/3s of the new triangle extend past the fold line beneath it.  Each time we do this the triangle gets smaller, and we create another step (like stairs) on top of the last fold. Keep your folds neat and well-defined.  This is the last time you do this kind of fold for the Three Stairs Fold. Once again you only want to let about 2/3s of the remaining triangle to stick out past the last fold.  The folds should be intact and facing the table. Be sure to support the folds while you turn so you don't have to redo them.  You should now have a triangle about one fourth the size of the whole handkerchief. Also, the multiple folds you did earlier should now be visible.  The new halfway fold from the previous step should be facing up and to the left.  This is similar to all of our earlier folds and serves the same purpose or creating a stable base.  You should now have a flat bottom line to fit into your suit.  Adjust the look to your liking and smooth out any creases or wrinkles.  

place the handkerchief on a hard flat, surface.  fold the bottom corner up to the top corner.  partially fold down the top half.  fold that triangle up again.  repeat this fold downward.  fold the tip upwards.  turn the pocket upside down.  fold the right side over to the left.  rotate the handkerchief 90˚ counterclockwise.  fold the bottom left corner halfway to the center.  fold the bottom right corner halfway to the center.  tuck the handkerchief in your coat pocket. 

 Stir the butter occasionally with a spatula to help it melt faster and to prevent it from burning.  Give everything a brisk stir with a fork or mini whisk to combine. Your basic glaze is almost complete but if you'd like a more savory dish, you could add 2 teaspoons of fresh dill and/or 2 teaspoons of fresh thyme.You can also use 1 teaspoon of dried dill or parsley instead., Stir the occasionally to prevent scorching. Adding the carrots into the glaze during the cooking process not only allows them to be coated with glaze, but it also infuses them with honey and sugar.  Once the carrots are done to your liking, transfer them to a serving dish. If you are serving them to small children, let them cool for a few minutes first. It might also be a good idea to cut them into smaller pieces for very young family members.  

melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat.  add the honey and brown sugar.  add the carrots, and continue cooking until they turn tender, about 15 minutes.  serve the carrots. 

 A good test proctor is well versed in the rules and regulations for any given exam. Study the exam or test regulations and commit them to memory. For example, if no breaks are allowed during the test, you should commit this rule to memory., The best proctors are those that have extensive experience proctoring exams. Sign up to proctor multiple exams and make an effort to learn from each individual experience. This will help you become a great exam proctor.  For a lot of proctoring positions, you will be required to proctor a minimum number of exams during your contract. For example, some universities require proctors to work at least four exams per semester.  Once you locate an institution or company through which you will seek experience as an exam proctor, you will need to be available to proctor the exams. If possible, keep flexible hours for other employment obligations to allow time in your schedule to proctor exams  

familiarize yourself with the examination administration procedures.  get as much proctoring experience as possible.  make sure you meet the minimum requirements.  keep a flexible schedule. 

 Avoid calling your flaws "flaws." Instead, see them as characteristics, rather than judging them harshly. Instead, see them as "quirks", "habits" or "something I do."   Do not label your characteristics as flaws. You can label yourself as "shy" or "withdrawn"--something that is probably bad. Or, you can simply think of yourself as a person who takes a while to warm up to new people -- which is totally normal. Use language that is loving and detailed rather than vague and judgmental. Look in the mirror everyday and say, "I really love myself." Literally say it out loud. Get on top of a high building and shout "I'm proud of myself." Say, for example, your flaw was being extremely ugly. If so, get on top of your roof and shout, "I'm ugly and I'm proud." People will respect you for your newfound bravery. Is it a "quirk"? A relatively harmless flaw may not really need "fixing"; you just may need to learn to work with your differences. Is it something that is sometimes useful? Some characteristics are sometimes a good thing, but sometimes a bad thing. That is not a flaw; it is just something that you have to work on to know when to use it, and when you have to approach things a different way. For example:  Stubbornness can be Determined. A stubborn person may be steadfast at the wrong time, and that may get problematic. But being steadfast about the right things can be a real gift.  Perfectionism sometimes is perfect. Perfectionists run into trouble when they try to make an imperfect world fit to exacting standards and get upset when the world will not cooperate. But surgeons, Olympic athletes, and engineers thrive in jobs where perfection is the goal.; , Include everything that occurs to you. Do not eliminate any quality because you think it might be redundant or unexceptional. List things like patience, kindness, bravery, determination, taste, intelligence, or loyalty. Sometimes there is so much focus on flaws, that the strengths a person possess get lost. Having a comprehensive self image will help you take a more balanced view of yourself.If you are feeling too down on yourself to make a list, free write for a while first. Also get ideas from friends and family. Sometimes others see good things in us that we do not always acknowledge in ourselves. And often these qualities are not said enough.  List accomplishments such as achieved goals, moments you surprised yourself, and hard times you survived. You can be proud of recovering from a hard situation, being present for someone who was in a hard time, completing projects at work or in school, or things you have learned. Write down your masteries, the things you have learned to do well., Writing freely, list the things you do that you don't feel good about. List things about yourself that you wish would change. Be as specific as possible. For example, instead of writing "The way I look," write "I don't like it when my skin breaks out." If you are writing about an incident, put it in as much context as possible.  Ask yourself how you got your habits and way of being. Are they cultural? Familial? Biological? When do they happen? Were you criticized by others? Have you absorbed messages from companies trying to prey on your insecurities to sell you something? If you say things you later regret, ask yourself if this is a lack of tact you learned from your family, or if it is your reaction to awkward situations.If you spend too much money, ask yourself what triggers these incidents, how you first started spending money, and what you hope for when you are spending. The more you can understand these past behaviors, the more likely you can forgive yourself for them., Do these qualities have positive sides? Look at your list of strengths and ask yourself if any of the strengths listed are also connected to the qualities you viewed as "flaws."Start to think about your characteristics in a positive way.Maybe you feel that you are too emotional. Reframe this thought to remind yourself that your emotionality is the reason why you have strong empathy skills to comfort others during hard times, and why people seek you out for care and assistance. Or perhaps you feel that you are too excitable, but that may tie into your incredible creativity. Positive reframing will not change these qualities, but it can give you a healthy change in perspective that will help you accept yourself., Treat yourself with loving compassion and respect. Instead of telling yourself off, speak to yourself calmly. When negative thoughts and feelings come to you, name them. Say "This is the I'm-too-fat thought," or, "Ah, here comes the 'everyone here knows more than me' thought.", When you are praised, say "Thank you." If a compliment is innocent and sincere, it is impolite to reject it. To reject a compliment means missing out on the chance for a positive connection with another, and a positive affirmation for yourself. Let your friends and family affirm you.   If you are feeling truly down on yourself, you can ask someone you love to tell you something they like about you. Go ahead and return the compliment.  Some cruelty comes disguised as kindness. Do you have a friend who is always pointing out your shortcomings? Does anyone in your life make fun of you or criticize you in public or in private? When you are proud of something, does anyone try to take you down a notch by acting nonplussed or condescending?   Try to eliminate these people from your life or spend as little time with them as possible., Accept the state you are in before you try making radical changes. If you try to fix yourself without acknowledging your inherent value and loveliness first, you may cause yourself harm. Improving yourself can be fruitful, but you have to love yourself first. Treat yourself like a flourishing garden that needs watering, pruning, planting, and general upkeep: not flood or fire.If you would like to do better in school, first tell yourself "I am intelligent, hard working, and I have dreams and ambitions. I am capable of doing the work I have set out to do." Do this instead of saying, for example, "I'm too stupid and lazy and I failed my last exam and I will fail the next one." Once you have a positive framework, you can work on your plan of action.  When there is something you want to work on, you are not eliminating or hiding a flaw of yours; rather, you are learning new skills.   Instead of "I'm going to stop talking so much," tell yourself "I'm going to learn how to listen better." Instead of "I'm going to stop being so judgmental," try "I'm going to work harder on understanding and accepting perspectives and lifestyles different from my own." Instead of "I'm going to lose weight," try "I'm going to work on taking better care of my body by exercising more, eating better, and reducing stress."  , There are a lot of images, beliefs, and ideas that one encounters in the world that may not be realistic to hold yourself or others up to. These may come from the media, from organizations like schools, or held by family and friends. If you find yourself unhappy with some aspect of yourself, you may have to confront these ideas. For example:   Looking like a supermodel. Only a very tiny percentage of people can come anywhere close to looking like an actor, model, or the like. Most people are not born gorgeous, thin, and whatever the "in" look is at the moment. Even then, they usually have a whole team of make-up artists, personal trainers, designers, and graphic artists to produce this image. Being less than this is not a flaw—you are just normal, which is just fine. If you are holding yourself up to a standard that is unrealistic, of course you will be unhappy. Being a perfect student. Most of education is focused on mathematics, science, and literacy. And while these are important, not everyone has these as strengths. Even brilliant people will flunk a quiz or forget a deadline occasionally. School, unfortunately, does not typically grade how good a friend you are, your artistic abilities, or how athletic you are, your ability to work hard, or your keen sense of adventure. Not being a great student is not necessarily a flaw—your strengths may simply lie elsewhere. You can be a successful adult without necessarily being a straight-A student. Not as "high achieving" as other family members. You may be made to feel flawed if you just do not share a family trait that is prized by family members. But you may not be flawed; you are just different. Although a well-balanced, loving family may embrace this, it can be hard to be who you are if you just are not like the others. This may include:  Athletic ability/ interest Intellect Political leanings. Faith Interest in family business Artistry    , Embracing your whole self, good and bad, does not mean you cannot commit yourself to personal growth.It simply means that you accept yourself--not just the good or the bad--but your whole self. You are who you are and that is OK, flaws and all. Self-acceptance means you accept yourself as you are in this moment, imperfect and unique, with no conditions.   If you keep thinking, "I can accept myself if I just stop eating so much and lose weight," then you are placing a condition on your self-acceptance that can always be disrupted.Feel free to pursue self-improvement, making yourself more effective or stronger, but never make that a condition of your self-acceptance.  It's natural to struggle or feel down about yourself sometimes. One of the ways to make things better is to talk about your feelings and ask the people around you for support. You don't have to be alone, and you deserve help.   If you are having a hard time at school or work, talk to someone. They can provide a sympathetic ear and help you figure out how to make things better. If you often feel very negatively towards yourself, consider asking a doctor to screen you for issues such as anxiety, depression, and body dysmorphic disorder. It can get better, and getting help is the first step.  Time and experience allows for opportunities to work on flaws. It usually takes time and making lots of mistakes to mature and develop, and it can take years. Have patience with yourself. Demanding flaws get resolved easily and quickly will lead to disappointment, because humans grow and develop and learn over an entire lifetime. For example:  The hothead teen grows into a responsible adult. The 3rd grade child who was a poor student turns his grades around when he learns some new study skills.  Support groups are available for a myriad of causes: from self-esteem building to eating disorder recovery. Consider looking up local support groups or finding positive online spaces if there is a particular thing you struggle with. The group can help you understand and accept your traits, and feel less alone.   There are many groups oriented towards various minorities. From Health At Every Size to Autistic culture to asexuality.org, there are communities you can find that will support your self-esteem and help you cope.  Choose to spend time with people who help you feel good about yourself. Limit your contact with people who make you feel worse. It's important to spend time with people who lift you up and make you happier.   Take initiative and ask people to hang out with you. Invite them to take a walk with you, come over to chat, or make plans with them.  As much as we might like to, we cannot change the past. Ruminating on past mistakes, whether they were a result of a decision you made or because you behaved in a certain way.All you can do is acknowledge the mistake and try to learn and grow from it.   If you cannot stop fixating on a mistake, say to yourself, "I made the best decision with the information (or abilities) that I had at the time."And now, with that mistake behind you, you have new information when making future decisions.  

rename your flaws.  make a list of all your strengths and abilities.  list things you are proud of.  list and become aware of your unique tendencies or needs.  think about past experiences.  reframe your thoughts.what made you consider each of these things as "flaws"?,  avoid self-criticism.  accept affirmation from others.  notice if someone is trying to put you down.  love it before you improve it.  re-frame how you view self-improvement.  recognize unrealistic standards.  know the difference between self-improvement and self-acceptance.  learn how to ask for help.  see yourself as a work in progress.  find support groups.  hang out with positive people.  work on forgiveness. 

 Weighing yourself regularly when you're trying to lose weight will help you monitor and track your progress and let you know how effective or ineffective your diet program is. Regular weight check-ins will show you your progress over time and may help keep you motivated.   Weigh yourself about 1-2 times a week. Weighing yourself each day will not give you an accurate perspective of your progress. Daily fluctuations in weight (either a gain or loss) are normal and may be due to what you ate, drank or did at the gym the day before.For the most accurate method of weighing, take your weight on the same day of the week, at the same time with the same clothes (or no clothes). Regular weigh-ins have also been shown to help prevent weight-gain., With any weight loss plan, it's important to check-in every month or two to see how effective your diet is. Review how much weight you've lost, how much more you'd like to lose and how your new diet is helping you reach your goals.   If your weight loss is steady or if you've reached your goal, the diet has most likely been successful. Keep on going! If your weight loss has been slow or has stopped, take time to reevaluate the diet, how you've been eating and following the plan. It might make sense to keep a food journal for a few days to make sure you're truly sticking to the diet. Also take into consideration how easy to follow your diet is and how it's making you feel. For example, if you're finding it overwhelming to have meat at each and every meal, you might want to make some changes to your plan to make it fit better with your lifestyle.  Support groups can be a great tool for weight loss. Whether it's friends, family members or other dieters, a support group can encourage and motivate you throughout your progress.Ask friends or family members if they'd like to join you on your meat-based diet. It's can be more fun if you have a whole group of people with the same goal. Get competitive with your support group. Set an end date for your weight loss competition and have an exciting prize for the winner.  

weigh yourself weekly.  reevaluate monthly.  build a support group. 

 This means if you want a one-word username, a two-word username, one with numbers, etc.   One-word usernames can be hard to figure out if you want it to make sense and able for people to pronounce it, but it is a great way if you want your username to be simple. Adding more words increases the chances of getting an available username, but it makes it a bit more complex and long (if you want a short username). Adding numbers are great to make it more unique, but if you're trying to "be like the rest", use numbers wisely, or not add them at all.; , Whether it's from rabbits, or to popsicles, the things you like an make your username more creative.  If you are going to do this, think about how your going to order it. For example, you have the words Whisperer and Tiger. Are you going to put in WhispererTiger or TigerWhisperer?  , These can add more letters to a one-word username, if it is taken.  Prefixes that are frequently used are "i" (as in iMarble), "ii" (as in iiCherry), or "x" (as in xSecretEdition). Suffixes that are used frequently are "ism" (as in Solidism), "ize", (as in Lyricize), or "XD" (as in PastelCatsXD).  These can add style to your username and if used properly, it won't make much of a difference.  The letter "x" is commonly used to replace certain letters, mostly vowels to make the person easily read the username. For example, if Legitamite is taken, you could replace the first "e" with "x", like Lxgitamite. The letter "v" is mostly only used to replace "u", like Pvmpkins instead of Pumpkins. It is rarely used to replace other letters. Numbers can replace letters as well. Since "3" looks like a backward "E", it is used to replace "E/e".  If you want your username to be rare, four-letter usernames are useful, since now ROBLOX requires a minimum of 3 characters. Adding another letter decreases its rarity but having a four-letter username is still considered very rare.  If your username consists of 2 or more words, capital usernames are useful.   For instance, if you're thinking of the username, "MostlyAnna", capitalizing the first letters of each word organizes it rather than having a username with all lowercase letters, such as "mostlyanna". If you want a one-word name, capitalizing the first letter wouldn't matter, as people won't have trouble reading it.  Don't copy someone else's username. For instance, if someone has the username, "Simplex", don't just add a letter and remove one and say it's your own, especially if you're copying someone who's well known.  

think about the "type" of username you want.  think about things you like.  consider adding common prefixes or suffixes.  add certain letters and numbers to replace some characters in your username.  try finding a four-letter username.  use capital and lowercase letters wisely.  make your username unique. 

 Chances are, your partner knows the reason why their parents dislike you. They likely haven’t brought it up to you because they don’t want to hurt your feelings. But what they need to know is that by withholding this information from you, they are actually making you feel worse because of the discontent between you and their parents.   Say to your partner, “I feel like your parents don’t like me. Do you know why? I understand you may not want to tell me because you think it might hurt my feelings, but I really want to make a connection with them and if I knew why, I may be able to do that.” Telling your partner you appreciate their concern, but you really want to work it out, may be just what you need to find out the truth.Make sure that you listen to what your partner has to say. You may be misinterpreting your partner’s family members’ behavior as dislike, when they may actually like you.; , Have an open and honest conversation with your partner’s parents about why they dislike you, if you can. Avoid being defensive or confrontational; simply state your reasons for why you think they don’t approve of you, and ask why. Attempt to remain respectful and polite throughout the entire conversation and you may get what you’re looking for.   Begin the conversation by saying, “Correct me if I’m wrong, but it seems that you don’t like me or disapprove of our relationship. I really love your child and I want to have a relationship with you, as well. Perhaps if you tell me what I’ve done to give you a bad impression, we can figure out a way to all get along.” You may not like what they have to say, so prepare yourself for a negative response. Try not to react, but instead be gracious and thank them for their time.Never stand for abuse from your partner’s family. If they are abusing you, such as by insulting you or calling you names, then stand up for yourself. Your partner should not stand for any type of abusive talk towards you either.  If you’re not able to speak with your partner or the parents, it’s time to get honest with yourself. Make a list of the possible reasons for the dislike and then come up with solutions for the issues. Try having a trustworthy friend help you with this if you think they might be more honest with you than your partner. You may not be able to work this out on your own, but understanding the possible obstacles and challenges you’ll face may serve as a helpful starting point.   Your list could include religious differences, personality clashes, jealousy, or simply dealing with parents who will never be happy with the person their child chooses. Parents often believe that no one will ever be good enough for their child, and you may simply have to accept that., In a non-confrontational way, ask your partner to speak with their parents about the reason for their dislike of you. Chances are, they’ll be more open and honest with their own child than you, so you’re more likely to get somewhere by having your partner talk to them. If your partner shows resistance or doesn’t feel comfortable about talking to their parents, relay just how important it is to you that you get along with them.   Your partner could say to their parents, “I get the feeling that you don’t like my partner. I was hoping we could discuss why that is. I love all of you and really want us all to get along.” Although the talk may not solve everything immediately, it can at least serve as a chance to get a conversation going.It may take a while to resolve the situation.  If your partner feels torn between you and their family, it can become a strain on the relationship. You can lessen the tension—and possibly warm up to your in-laws—by solidifying a bond with someone who is open-minded. Perhaps your partner has a sibling, cousin, or grandparent who is polite to you. Present your best case to this person and they just might be willing to defend you to the rest of the family. They might also be able to give you some insight into the parent’s typical pattern of behaviors and whether or not this is a common thing for them to do.   If that doesn’t work, at the very least, this person provides a safe harbor when you must attend family gatherings or events. Hang out or chat with them instead of feeling isolated all by yourself. 

ask your partner if they know the reason for the dislike.  talk to the parents.  write down possible ideas for the cause of the dislike.  ask your partner to talk to their parents.  find an ally in the family. 

 The formula is sum=(n−2)×180{\displaystyle sum=(n-2)\times 180}, where sum{\displaystyle sum} is the sum of the interior angles of the polygon, and n{\displaystyle n} equals the number of sides in the polygon.The value 180 comes from how many degrees are in a triangle. The other part of the formula, n−2{\displaystyle n-2} is a way to determine how many triangles the polygon can be divided into. So, essentially the formula is calculating the degrees inside the triangles that make up the polygon.This method will work whether you are working with a regular or irregular polygon. Regular and irregular polygons with the same number of sides will always have the same sum of interior angles, the difference only being that in a regular polygon, all interior angles have the same measurement.In an irregular polygon, some of the angles will be smaller, some of the angles will be larger, but they will still add up to the same number of degrees that are in the regular shape. ; , Remember that a polygon must have at least three straight sides.  For example, if you want to know the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon, you would count 6 sides.  Remember, n{\displaystyle n} is the number of sides in your polygon.  For example, if you are working with a hexagon, n=6{\displaystyle n=6}, since a hexagon has 6 sides. So, your formula should look like this:sum=(6−2)×180{\displaystyle sum=(6-2)\times 180}   , To do this, subtract 2 from the number of sides, and multiply the difference by 180. This will give you, in degrees, the sum of the interior angles in your polygon.  For example, to find out the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon, you would calculate:sum=(6−2)×180{\displaystyle sum=(6-2)\times 180}sum=(4)×180{\displaystyle sum=(4)\times 180}sum=(4)×180=720{\displaystyle sum=(4)\times 180=720}So, the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is 720 degrees.   

set up the formula for finding the sum of the interior angles.  count the number of sides in your polygon.  plug the the value of n{\displaystyle n} into the formula.  solve for n{\displaystyle n}. 

 Make sure you know where the food is kept and how much the dog is typically fed per day. Ask about their favorite treats and how often they’re given treats. You should also ask about food allergies and any digestive problems the dog may be prone to. Some dogs require dietary supplements or medications so be sure to ask about that as well.Never feed a dog chocolate, grapes, milk, cheese, onions, nuts, garlic, yeasted bread, avocadoes, or anything with caffeine. If you feed it an apple, make sure you remove the pit as it is poisonous for canines.; , All dogs need to be walked daily but some need more exercise than others. Ask the owner about the dog’s exercise routine and how often there are walked. Some dogs like the familiarity of their walking route so ask where they are taken as well.In addition to exercise, you may want to take them to a dog park where it can run around freely and socialize with other dogs. You should also consider researching exercise needs for specific breeds., Dogs often have unforeseen medical crises so you’ll want to be prepared. Make sure you ask about past health problems and research health problems associated with the dog’s breed and how you should handle them. You may vet records in case you need to take the dog to a pet hospital during an emergency.If you have to give the dog medication, ask how it’s typically delivered. If you have to give them pills, it may help to crush them or hide them in food., Proper dog training requires consistency and you can mess up the dog’s behavioral expectations by giving them treats too often or giving improper commands. Ask about how the dog has been trained and how you should react to good and bad behaviors. You can also reinforce their training by giving them commands they’ve already learned and rewarding them appropriately.   Make sure to ask if the dog is good with children and strangers if you foresee it interacting with them.  The dog’s owner should provide you with everything you need including food, treats, feeding bowls, a leash and collar, plastic bags for picking up excrement during walks, and a cage. Nonetheless, make sure you know where everything is located in the house so you can access it quickly.   You may also want to know where to buy additional food, medication, or anything else the dog might need, especially if the owner is going to be away from a long time. Always keep contact information so you can speak with the owner if you have any questions.  Dogs are messy eaters and will often spill water and food around the surrounding area. You should clean this area daily as dogs will eat rotting food or lick water off the floor. You should also do a more thorough cleaning of the food bowls and surrounding floor area with disinfectant at least once a week., Dogs are creatures of habits and can experience anxiety if their schedules change. The dog will be even more sensitive to changes since their owner is gone and especially if they’re staying in a home they aren’t used to.Try to walk and feed them at roughly the same time of the day, especially in the first few days of taking care of them.  You should try to spend a lot of time with the dog you are caring for when you first meet it. Dogs can suffer from separation anxiety when their owners leave. This can be countered by giving the dog attention and getting it used to your presence.Take the dog for a walk or play a game fetch soon after you meet it. This will distract the dog from the owner’s absence and help it bond with you. It’s especially important to spend a lot of time with the dog if you’re taking it to your home rather than spending time at the owners. They may look for things to chew on or destroy in a new environment so you’ll want to be nearby to prevent this.Dogs recognize people based on smell. Give the dog time to sniff your hand so they get used to your scent or they might get nervous each time you walk into the room., The anxiety of missing their owner can cause dogs to ignore their training and behave badly.They may start to chew on things, eliminate in the house, or otherwise destroy things. You should generally keep a close eye on the dog for the first few hours.   If the dog is behaving badly, start by taking them for a walk or giving them a treat to calm them down. Walks are good because the dog will work out their aggression outside and be tired when they return home., If you are taking the dog your home, you should keep the dog in a cage or leashed to a stationary object when they are left alone. Dogs get anxious in new environments, especially when they’re alone and may engage in destructive behavior. 

determine their dietary habits.  determine their exercise needs.  ask about the dog’s medical history.  determine their level of training.  make sure you have the right supplies.  keep the feeding area clean.  stick to their schedule.  spend time with it.  watch for bad behaviors.  secure the dog when you leave the house. 

 This means, figure out the day of the party, the start time and the end time, where, extra information, and who you are going to be inviting.; , You are going to want to send out your invitations about a week or two before the day of the party. If it is a last minute party, get them out as quick as you can! You can make homemade invitations, or you can buy some from a party store.  Since Katy Perry lives in a Candyland, make a candy buffet. Katy Perry has grown up a little bit for her latest album Prism, so if you would like to go for that side of her, then buy some animal print things, and gold things (mostly representing Roar, and Dark Horse). Also remember you can hang pictures of Katy, and anything else you can think of for more decorations!  , If you are going to go with the candy buffet, then that's probably all you need for food, but Katy also symbolizes cupcakes, so you can also have cupcakes (you can also buy Katy Perry cupcake toppers on Google). If you are not doing the candy buffet, you can get a cake and some pizza.  This is always an important part of parties; you don't want your guests bored, do you? No! Some fun game ideas are:   Pin the lollipop to the Katy: Just like pin the tail on the donkey. Get a big picture of Katy, put it on your wall. Print out a lollipop picture, put tape on the back of it and try to tape the lollipop to Katy's hand (get a picture of Katy where a hand is visible). Katy's truth or dare: It's just truth or dare, but make it kitty-lisious by putting her name in front! Katy charades: Play charades, but with a twist. Have you and your guest act out a Katy Perry song. Put Katy Perry songs on little papers and put them in a bowl, have some one pick and then everyone else has to try to guess the song. Make sure they are common Katy Perry songs, so everyone knows the song. You can also watch the Katy Perry movie! How fun!  

gather information.  send invitations.  make decorations.  make food.  provide entertainment. 

 Look for their original movies, as well as official spin-offs and sequels. Notice their personalities, and how they act and react in various situations.; , Try searching for Wikipedia articles and Wikia articles. These can give you comprehensive detail on their personalities, abilities, et cetera.  From Elsa's anxiety disorder to Rapunzel's character arc, analyses can offer insights that allow you to write more accurate stories.  

watch movies about the characters.  read wiki entries about the characters.  read analyses of the characters. 

 Most herbs are safe for allergy relief, but your medical history might put you at risk for certain treatments.   Discuss other remedies that might work for you if you are unable to use herbs.; , This is the same thing that over the counter drugs with antihistamines do.  A member of the daisy family, this herb comes from Europe and can be taken in tablet form.   Look for Butterbur tablets online or in retailers based in European countries. It can be hard to find in the United States. Take a tablet 4 times a day to get the same result as an over the counter antihistamine. A study published in The British Medical Journal reports that the effects are the same, without any drowsiness.  It is inexpensive and can be purchased online or in health food stores all over the world.   Look for nettles that are available in a tincture made from fresh or freeze dried nettle leaves. Using 2 to 4 mL (0.4 to 0.8 tsp.) 3 times per day will help relieve symptoms. You can also find it in a capsule form. Wait 2 or 3 days if the nettles are not immediately effective. It often takes a few days for them to start working.  Goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis) is also called orange-root and it grows wild in Canada and the United States.   Drink the tonic after applying a saline nasal spray to your nose for best results. The saline will clear out congestion and the Goldenseal will use its astringent and antibiotic properties to help rid the nasal passages of pollen.  This herb is native to colder regions in the northern hemisphere but can be found in many health food stores and through homeopathic retailers.   Add a 1/2 tsp. (2.4 mL) to a cup of hot water to make a tea. This herb will help the body block antibodies that cause allergies.  The licorice root is a plant used to flavor foods, drinks and tobacco and it also decreases inflammation and allergic reactions.   Take only moderate amounts of licorice, as directed by your doctor. Too much of this herb can cause high blood pressure and drain your body of its potassium reserves.  

talk to your doctor.  look for herbs that will prevent the production of histamines in your system.  try butterbur for allergy relief.  use stinging nettle to relieve allergy symptoms such as sneezing, congestion and watery eyes.  try a tonic made from the herb goldenseal.  brew a tea with the angelica herb.  use licorice to combat allergies. 

 To do this, debit Intercorporate Investment and credit Cash.   For example, if the parent bought $50,000 worth of a subsidiary’s stock, it would debit Intercorporate Investment for $50,000 to reflect the new asset and credit cash for $50,000 to reflect the cash outflow.; , To do this, debit Cash and credit Intercorporate Investment.   For example, say that the parent company receives $1,000 of dividends from the subsidiary. The parent company debits cash for $1,000 and credits Intercorporate Investment for $1,000 to reflect the fact that the dividend decreased the subsidiary’s retained earnings.  To do this, debit the Intercorporate Investment account and credit Gain on Investment.   The value used here will depend on the current market value of the subsidiary stock. The process of adjusting the recorded value to the current market value is known as marking to market (MTM).For example, say that the parent’s investment in the subsidiary is now worth $55,000 instead of $50,000 because the market value of the stock has increased 10% in the last year. The parent company would debit Intercompany Investment for $5,000 to reflect that the value of its asset increased and credit gain on investment for $5,000., To do this, debit the Intercorporate Investment account and credit Investment Revenue.   For example, assume the parent company owns 60 percent of the subsidiary, and the subsidiary reports a profit of $100,000. The parent company debits Intercorporate Investment for $60,000 (60 percent of $100,000) and credits Investment Revenue for $60,000., In order to make the preparation of consolidated financial statements easier, it's best to identify transactions that will be adjusted. These include any accounts payable, accounts receivable, and sales transactions that occur between the parent company and its subsidiary.Mark these transactions with a special reference tag in the ledger so that they can be accounted for at the end of the year.  Consolidated financial statements are necessary if the parent exercises majority control over the subsidiary. Majority control means that parent can control what the subsidiary does.Since, by definition, parents own more than 50 percent of the subsidiary’s stock, the parent usually exercises majority control. If the subsidiary is going through bankruptcy, a foreign country restricts remittance of profits to the parent, or the parent can’t control the subsidiary’s operations, it may not have majority control and doesn’t have to prepare consolidated financial statements.  List the subsidiary’s balance sheet and income statement information next to the parent’s accounting data. Add each line item together to determine the consolidated balance.For example, if the parent has $40,000 in accounts receivable and the subsidiary has $30,000 in accounts receivable, the consolidated column should indicate $70,000 of accounts receivable.  Intercorporate transactions are those that take place between the parent and subsidiary. The balance of any intercorporate transactions must be subtracted from consolidated statements so that sales don’t seem overinflated. There are three types of intercorporate transactions that must be accounted for: stock-holdings, sales, and receivables/payables.   Intercorporate stockholding issues cause an overstatement of the outstanding stock balance by reporting subsidiary stock owned by the parent as outstanding stock. This can be remedied with a debit to the subsidiary's common stock, paid-in capital in excess of par, and retained earnings accounts and a credit to the investment in stock of subsidiary account for an equal amount. These transactions will be for the book value of the subsidiary stock and related accounts.For example, if the parents owns $100,000 in the subsidiary's stock and the subsidiary's retained earnings total $50,000, their common stock and paid-in capital in excess of par would be debited for a total of $100,000 (depending on how much the par value of the stock is) and their retained earnings would be debited for $50,000. Then, the parent company's investment in subsidiary stock account would be credited for $150,000.   Intercorporate sales arise from inventory transfers that take place between parent and subsidiary. Keep in mind that a sale isn't considered consummated until the item sold to the subsidiary is re-sold to an independent third party. In these cases, one side may report a profit, even though no transaction has taken place. This means that several accounts will be overstated in the consolidated reports. Identify these inventory transfers and then debit consolidated retained earnings credit consolidated ending inventory for the value of the transfers. For example, if $50,000 worth of product was transferred from the subsidiary to the parent, the consolidated statements would record a $50,000 debit to retained earnings and a $50,000 credit to consolidated ending inventory.   Intercorporate receivables and payables arise from transactions between parent and subsidiary. Essentially, this appears on the consolidated statement like the consolidated company owes itself money. This issue can be fixed with debits to consolidated accounts payable and credits to consolidated accounts receivable as necessary to eliminate intercorporate transactions.For example, if a sale is recorded from subsidiary to parent in the amount of $20,000 and an entry for accounts receivable is made in the subsidiary's accounts, an entry should be made crediting consolidated accounts receivable for $20,000 to eliminate this transaction.    

record the parent’s purchase of the subsidiary’s stock.  record any dividends that the subsidiary pays the parent company.  record any changes in the value of the subsidiary stock.  record the parent’s percentage of the subsidiary’s annual profit.  identify transactions that will need to be adjusted in consolidated financial statements.  determine if the parent needs to prepare consolidated financial statements.  prepare the consolidated financial statements.  adjust the consolidated statements for any intercorporate transactions. 

 The second you get your driver's license, this is an option. Odds are there's something going on somewhere in your community -- so seek it out. Go to a community meeting, find someone with an air of authority, and ask how you can help out. Step 1? Check.   Generally speaking, there's a 5-10 month window for serious volunteer work that precedes the election date, whatever election it may be. Every four years there's obviously the big presidential campaign, but every two there are smaller, state-wide campaigns that need help, too. If you've hit the right time, you've wandered into the wonderful world of door-knocking and making political phone calls. It's not glamorous work, but you have to start somewhere. If you find a candidate whose views align with your own, being passionate about spreading the word will be easy.; , Not only is this near mandatory for your imminent political success, but it will expose you to a whole bunch of organizations and people you otherwise wouldn't know of or meet. It's best to major in political science, law, communications or statistics, depending on your ultimate goals.   Once you've got your mini-fridge and collapsible shoe rack unpacked and you've exchanged an awkward hello with your dormmate, find the organization on campus affiliated with your political party. Each campus should have one and they'll be able to get you started. Eventually, think about running for student government and being an active part of campus politics. While you're at it, get involved in local and municipal elections. You'll want to have as many irons in the fire as possible, small as they may be. The more people who know you, the easier it'll be to make connections and continue climbing the ladder.  Namely, with the military and nonprofit organizations. While virtually every president has been involved in some charitable initiative, 32 of the 45 presidents (let's ignore Grover Cleveland at the moment) have had some kind of military service to their name.If you’ve ever seriously considered joining the military, this is a path that has led many people into political office. Whether you’re thinking about joining as an enlisted service member or putting the time into studying to become an officer, the leadership skills, discipline and experiences can make for an impressive political resume in the future. However, there’s far more to serving in the military than political aspirations, so make sure you’re fully aware of the responsibilities and dangers before making a final decision. Another career option you might want to consider is working for a nonprofit, community organization in your area. By landing a position in a community outreach program or charitable initiative, you’ll begin building a resume that demonstrates you care about helping the people around you.  Alright, you've done the dirty deed of door knocking and you've met all the right people. Now it's time to be movin' on up. A field organizer is the next logical position -- you'll now be directing and recruiting volunteers to do the job you just did for either a state-wide or coordinated campaign.   A state-wide campaign is pretty self-explanatory. You are working on behalf of a candidate that is running for some type of political office within the state. It can be anything from the Secretary of Agriculture to a senator. Sometimes the teams are quite small -- a little more than a dozen or so people can comprise the entire team (depending on the candidate and the state, obviously). A coordinated campaign is where you're working for the entire party, more or less. If a whole bunch of offices are open for election, sometimes campaigns merge to kill two birds with one stone (or three, or four). That way, instead of Mrs. Jenkins throwing out the third door knocker she had to be bothered by that day and subsequently switching her party affiliation, she's only contacted once and can thoroughly enjoy her free bumper sticker.  Woohoo, look at you! Now that you've proven your worth, it's time to oversee the field organizers and work with county parties. You'll be speaking to various groups and truly represent the party and your candidate.   You'll also be hiring a field staff and setting the win number once you hit Field Director material. Needless to say, the responsibilities are many.  Now it's time to oversee the implementation of the entire campaign plan. You'll be assembling a team of directors (fundraising, communications, comptrollers and the treasurer) and making sure everything goes smoothly.   If your candidate wins, you're likely to receive an offer to work in the official office. So, from your perspective, it's obviously best to work with a candidate who's serious and has a likelihood of winning. From here on out, it's time for you to run for an office of your own.  

volunteer.  go to college.  beef up your resume in other ways.  become a field organizer.  advance to a director position.  manage a campaign. 

 Before you start writing, think about the audience you are addressing.Are you addressing the entire student body? Just one grade? A classroom?   So, if you’re talking to one classroom, don’t only talk to the classroom about a general problem the school has. Talk to the classroom about how that general problem affects them and how you can change it. For example, don’t say: “The breaks in between homeroom and first period aren’t long enough.” Say: “Everybody in homeroom has gotten at least one demerit for being late to first period. We can’t get all the way from North Campus to South Campus in time. Elect me as homeroom representative, and I won’t let the administration forget it.”  , All writing has a beginning, middle and end. Outlining your thoughts first will help you stay on track as you write the speech.The beginning needs to catch people’s attention and raise the questions you’re going to answer. The middle needs to provide the answers, and the end connects the answers back to the questions. In very simple terms: You tell them what you’re going to tell them. Then, you tell them. Then you tell them what you told them., Open your campaign speech with your theme, or main idea.You don’t stand anything to gain by beating around the bush, because people naturally want to pay attention to themselves. You have to convince them to listen to you. For example:   Don’t say: “My name is Joe Blow, and I’m running for City Council. I’m a member of…” Instead, get right to it. Say: “Not a single person in this city thinks the parking situation on Main St. is adequate. No one.” There's a lot of ways to get this done. You can use a story, a challenge, a joke, or just vividly describe a problem. You just need to get the audience's attention quickly. Earn their attention, don't expect it to come to you.  Once you’ve got their attention, don’t let go. The middle of your speech needs to explain the issues you raised in the introduction and convince people that you can do something about them, but you need to vary the way you tackle the issues.You want to have a good mix of facts, feelings, and action. If you only talk facts, your audience will get bored. Only talk feelings, and you’ll wear them out. Only talk action, and it invites disbelief, because you haven’t offered enough factual and emotional support for your argument.  The conclusion is just as important as the introduction. It's the last chance you have to leave an impression, so make sure they remember you by raising the stakes.   To continue with the parking example, don’t end your speech talking about the width and number of parking spaces on Main St. Make it bigger than that—something that makes them feel weaker for not supporting you and stronger for supporting you. “This isn’t just about parking spaces. The parking situation is just a symptom of everything that’s wrong with the Council in this city. We’ve asked. We’ve begged. We’ve done all we could. Now we have to send a message that they can’t just ignore us.” With this kind of appeal, you put the listener in a position where they are either a person who votes for you or a person who lets themselves be ignored. Most people will take the first choice.  

tailor your message to your audience in specific ways.  outline your speech.  make your point quickly.  support your theme.  raise the stakes at the end. 

 Tremors are the telltale sign of little white shaker syndrome. They can start suddenly, get worse for 1 to 3 days, then remain about the same until treatment begins. Tremors that get worse with certain activities (e.g., excitement, eating) are called intention tremors.Tremors are usually generalized, meaning the whole body shakes.The tremors may be mild or so severe that your Maltese cannot walk. They may lessen when he sleeps.; , In addition to body tremors, your Maltese’s eyes may be affected by little white shaker syndrome. His eyes may move rapidly from side to side (‘nystagmus’).Your Maltese would not be able to control this movement.  Little white shaker syndrome can affect your Maltese’s ability to walk normally. For example, he may have exaggerated leg movements when he walks; this is called hypermetria.In general, he may be uncoordinated when he walks, which is called ataxia.Little white shaker syndrome affects the cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls balance and posture., Little white shaker syndrome can be difficult to diagnose. It is usually a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that other common causes are ruled out first. To diagnose your Maltese’s tremors, your vet will analyze blood and urine samples. They will also take a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the lower part of your Maltese’s spine.Your vet would need to sedate your Maltese to take the CSF sample. Give your vet a thorough history of your Maltese, including his health before the tremors started and what you have noticed since the tremors started. Results of the diagnostic testing may be normal.  If your Maltese is really ill, or his tremors are severe, your vet may want to hospitalize him until he is stable and strong enough for at-home care. For example, if your Maltese’s tremors are caused by an infectious disease that has made him very sick, he may need intensive veterinary treatment for that disease before going home.Be aware that in-hospital treatment may get expensive.  Little white shaker syndrome is usually treated with corticosteroids (also called steroids), which reduce inflammation. Initially, your vet will prescribe a high steroid dose.As the tremors improve, your vet will lessen the dosage, then stop the medication completely when the tremors have stopped.The initial steroid dose is immunosuppressive, meaning that immune system function is reduced.Drugs called benzodiazepines, which reduce anxiety, are also used to treat little white shaker syndrome.Valium is a benzodiazepine used to treat this condition.Your vet will let you know how long your Maltese will need to be treated.  Most dogs treated for little white shaker syndrome recover completely within the first week or two of treatment. Even if your Maltese’s tremors have stopped, give him the full treatment course. If you stop treatment too early, the tremors could come back. If the tremors return, your vet will prescribe the original steroid dosage again.Some dogs do not fully recover with treatment. These dogs may need lifelong steroid treatment., For the first month after initial treatment, your vet will want to see your Maltese each week to assess his improvement. After that, they will likely recommend monthly appointments.During these appointments, your vet will reduce the steroid dose, provided that your Maltese is improving.  

observe tremors in your maltese.  look at your maltese’s eyes.  watch your maltese walk.  take your maltese to your vet.  hospitalize your maltese, if necessary.  give your maltese medications.  monitor your maltese for improvement.  schedule follow-up appointments with your vet. 

 The sale price is $15. What was the original price?" or "An investment grew by 22% and is now worth $1525. How much was invested originally?"   To solve these questions, you must understand that percentages are applied using multiplication. Whether it is an increase or decrease, it was applied using multiplication. Your job, therefore, is to undo that multiplication. You are not undoing the increase or decrease; you are undoing the application of the percentage. Therefore, three things will be true:  You will be dividing by the percent. If you have an increase, you will still add the percentage to 100. If you have a decrease, you will still subtract the percentage from 100.  Sales tax, for example, is an increase; discounts are a decrease. An investment that grows in value is an increase; a population that declines in numbers is a decrease and so forth.   Let's imagine we have to work out the following problem: "A video is on sale at 75% off. The sale price is $15. What is the original price?"  Sale is another word for discount, so we're dealing with a decrease. $15 is our "after amount," because it's the number we have after the sale has been applied.  If it's a decrease, subtract the percentage from 100.   Because we're dealing with a decrease/discount, we'll subtract 100 - 75, giving us 25%.  Do this by moving the decimal point two places to the left or dividing the number by 100.   25% becomes 0.25.  This will help us reverse the multiplication that we talked about in Step 1.    Grab a calculator, punch in '15,' hit divide, enter in '0.25,' and hit equals.  You've just calculated the original price.   15 divided by 0.25 = 60, which means the original price was $60. If you want to double-check your answer to make sure it's correct, multiply the sale price (75%, or 0.75) with the original price ($60) and see if you get the sale price. ($15): 0.75 x 60 = $45 sale; $60 (original price) - $45 (sale amount) = $15 (sale price)    , To better understand this type of problem, read the prompt and see if you understand how to finish the following problem: "An investment grew by 22% and is now worth $1,525. How much was invested originally?"   This is an increase situation, so add 100 + 22. Convert the answer to a decimal: 122% becomes 1.22 On a calculator, enter '1,525', hit divide, enter '1.22', hit equals. Label the answer. For this problem, 1,525 divided by 1.22 = 1250, so the original investment was $1,250.  

use the unknown original amount method for the following sorts of problems: "a video game is on sale at 75% off.  decide if it's an increase or decrease situation.  if it's an increase, add the percentage to 100.  convert that number into a decimal.  divide the "after amount" by the decimal from step 3.  our "after amount" is $15, and our decimal is 0.25.  label appropriately and you're done.  practice on the following examples. 

 Get a sense of what you know and don’t know. Take a look at official spelling bee word lists and identify words that you have trouble spelling and words that don’t seem so difficult. It’s important to know what level you’re at so you don’t try to learn words that are too advanced., Write yourself a list that highlights what you expect to learn. Include a timeline for your learning. Make your objectives challenging but realistic. Since there are so many words to learn, having a set of learning objectives will help you stay on track and keep you focused. Plus, you’ll be able to tell if you’re meeting your goals, need to revise your goals, or work harder., Figure out when you study best. Research shows that many people study best during the day and early evening. Find a place that is free of outside distractions. Break up your study periods so you don’t study for too long and begin to forget important words., Take a look at your calendar and determine how much time you have before the spelling bee. This will determine how often you should study. Try to practice at least 30-40 minutes a day. 

assess yourself.  create a set of objectives.  find an appropriate time and place to study.  put together a training schedule. 

 If he loves to channel surf as much as the average brother, then this will be the perfect prank for him. Just take a tiny piece of clear tape and cover the light on the remote just enough so that it no longer works. He'll be completely confused when he tries to watch his favorite show, and may even try to put in new batteries before he figures out your trick (if he figures it out at all!). This works best when you have his least favorite TV show playing.  Make a box of jello and pour a layer into a container large enough to hold the game controller. Use food wrap to completely cover the game controller, then for added security, place it into an airtight bag and seal tightly. When the layer of jello has hardened, place the controller on top and cover it with a layer of liquid jello. Let it harden. Take out the jello. Place the controller back and watch him freak out., If he actually manages to step away from his computer for five minutes, change his desktop picture to something completely ridiculous as quickly as you can. Pick My Little Ponies, Teletubbies, or pictures of the cutest cats you've ever seen. This works best if he has a laptop that he'll be taking out in public later, so he can surprise a room full of people with the desktop filled with flowers and puppies.  

"break" his remote.  put his video game controller in jello.  change his desktop picture.

 Hold your fingers 1 foot (0.3 m) above the person's forehead and ask them to look up, focusing on your two index fingers without moving their head upwards. This should result in their eyes having to look up. Ensure your fingers are in a position so it is possible for the person to see.; , They should naturally breathe in as your hand moves up; and breathe out as your hand moves down. You may say "breathe in, and out," during the process of moving your hands, repeating at least 5 times before moving on to step 3.  Repeat the request, continuing step 2 for another two or three times, although ideally they should not know how many times.  Relax every muscle around the eyes, so much, that even if they wanted to, their eyes would be so tired, they would not work. Within 30 seconds of telling them how relaxed their eyes are, ask them to try to open their eyes. They will find that they can't. After about 5 -10 seconds of trying. Tell them, "OK, stop trying now and just keep relaxing."  , Once their eyes are closed inform that they're going to "send a wave of relaxation right across your body, so that it is as relaxed as your eyes already are, relaxing twice as much as you already are."  , Say, "one, two, three, open your eyes; and shut them." Repeat the process three times, increasing the relaxation each time(suggest that they relax ten times as much the second time, and twenty times as much the third time).  Say to them, "At this point, if you have followed what I have asked you to do, it should be really limp, loosed and relaxed, like a rag," (or something to that effect), "and when I drop it in your lap, you will feel a wave of relaxation throughout your body."  ,,, Encourage them to concentrate on physical relaxation. Instruct them to, at your command, start counting down from 100, following the pattern: "100, deeper relaxed; 99, deeper relaxed; 98, deeper relaxed," advising that after a few numbers, they will forget what the next number is. They will find that the numbers have disappeared from their mind, because it has become so relaxed.  As they count, suggest to them that the numbers are disappearing. Once they've stopped talking, ask them if all the numbers have gone. They may just make a little nod, that is enough.  Let them know that just as it is possible to tense up and reach the height of tension, it is possible to relax and reach the opposite. Say to them "it is now necessary for 'us'" (note the 'us'; this assumes you're not making them do something)"to go to the basement of relaxation".  Inform them that when you click your fingers, the lift is going to start going down to floor A, and that to get there they are going to relax completely, twice as much as they are already. When you click your fingers a second time, they are going to be completely relaxed, twice as much, down to floor B; and when you click your fingers a third time, down to floor C. Tell them to let you know when they are at the basement by saying the letter.  Wait for them to say A; repeat with B, and with C. It is worth noting that usually at floor C the letter C sometimes does not seem to come out of the mouth. If this is the case, your attempt at hypnosis is successful(this doesn't mean that if they're able to say C, your attempt is unsuccessful).  Say to the person, "If I click my fingers and say sleep, any time today, you will find that you'll instantly return to this lovely deep level of relaxation and concentration. In fact, for every time I click my fingers today and say sleep, you'll go deeper into hypnosis than you were the time before".  A good one would be asking the person to imagine they're at the top of a staircase with 100 stairs, which they can see and feel. On the side of each stair is a number. Each step they take they'll see and feel themselves relaxing twice as much. At the bottom is a large mattress, and when they get there they'll relax completely into the mattress.  You can determine how far they are by asking them what number is on the stair.  Keep suggesting that they're "going deeper and nearer to the mattress; and more relaxed with each breath" as they go down the stairs. , Tell them there are balloons filled with helium attached to their wrist, and that they can feel the balloons lifting their wrist into the air. You should see their hands, and arms, visibly rising into the air. , Count to three. Once they're awake start talking about something different for a few minutes, before asking them what they remember. Try the re-induction and if they return to hypnosis, then carry on. If they don't, unfortunately it hasn't worked.  Suggest they're feeling hot (they could perhaps imagine they're at the beach), and now they're cold; ask them again to imagine they're watching a film, and that it's really really funny, and then scary. Now ask them to open their eyes and remain under hypnosis. You should notice they're able to walk and talk while still in hypnosis. If they wake up and open their eyes, they'll likely inform you that "it didn't work". Try the re-induction and suggest that they will wake up whenever you say the word. If they don't, they may appear to have a blank stare. Continue to make suggestions after suggestions without needing to put them to 'sleep' again.  Tell them, "on the count of three you will wake up, fully awake and alert, feeling great, and all suggestions will be removed". You could also suggest "you will remember everything you did", or "you won't remember what you did under hypnosis". Then count to three.  This does not mean they're still under hypnosis, however they may be slightly more suggestible for a little while.  

hold two fingers (index and middle) in a v shape.  ask the person to breathe in and out as you move your hand up and down.  instruct them to close their eyes as you pass your hand down in front of their face.  suggest that they relax their eyes as much as possible.  instruct them to open and close their eyes, at your request.  ask them to open their eyes on the count of three.  tell them you're going to pick up their right hand.  do the same with the left hand.  ,  repeat the above two steps.  ,  suggest that they be as physically relaxed as they can.  ask them to start counting down.  explain to them the 'basement of relaxation technique.  ask them to imagine they are in an elevator (uk lift).  click your fingers.  at this point it is best to suggest re-induction.  to continue with hypnosis, use a deepener.  ask them to start going down.  let them know how they're progressing.  repeat the re-induction suggestions above.  ,  they've now reached the bottom of the stairs.  repeat the re-induction suggestions.  ,  advise them that on the count of three they're going to be wide awake.  at this point you can make suggestions.  when you have finished, bring them out out of hypnosis.  the person may feel a bit 'dazed' even after hypnosis. 

 Line either side or both sides of your driveway with a low fence that matches the aesthetic of your home’s exterior. For more flexibility in your property’s appearance, select materials that can painted, like wood or vinyl. Enhance your landscaping even further by painting the fence a new color.Fencing also allows you to add more elements, like hanging lanterns or flower baskets, after installation. Being able to repaint your fence can help you update your borders' accents to complement your home if you repaint the exterior a new color.  If you don’t like the idea of limiting access to the driveway from the lawn, but still want to make a bold statement with vibrant colors, go with this option. Plant the same species of ornamental tree along your driveway, or create a pattern by alternating between species.The best kind to use will vary depending on your climate and region, but popular choices include:Cornus Mas Eastern Redbud Japanese Tree or Dwarf Korean Lilac Kousa Dogwood Serviceberry  , If ornamental trees would be too tall or crowded to suit your driveway, but you’d still like both a substantial and natural border for it, opt for shrubs instead. Also choose these if you’d like to tie the driveway into your home that much more by extending the shrub border around your home as well. Add even more pizazz by using the shrubs as topiary and trimming them into eye-catching designs.As with trees, region and climate will determine what type of shrub is best for your area. Popular choices, though, include burkwood viburnum, India hawthorn, and “Pallida” Chinese witch hazel., If you’d prefer your border to use color rather than height to draw attention to your driveway, line it with flowers instead of shrubs, trees, or fences. Define the edges of your driveway with plants that catch the eye. Use this technique to divide your driveway from the rest of your lawn without seriously hindering accessibility from one to the other. However, remember that this a high-traffic area, so keep in mind that:Vegetables can be just as colorful as flowers, but since whatever you plant here will be exposed to lots of car exhaust, don’t plant anything you intend to eat. Opting for durable ground cover plants (like blue star creeper or Corsican mint) is a better idea than planting fragile flowers, since it’s always possible for a car to go off track and roll over your flower bed., If you have a curved driveway, keep in mind that the eye is naturally drawn toward to the curve(s) when viewing the driveway as a whole. Utilize this tendency by placing a unique design element there to punch up your property’s appearance that much more. Options include:Planting a tree or shrub. Starting a water or rock garden. Adding a wishing well or other lawn decorations.  

install fencing.  line your driveway with ornamental trees.  plant shrubs.  lay a flower bed.  add something distinctive to curves. 

 If you're just learning how to play, go to your local sporting goods store, and you can find a basic stick for around 30 dollars. If you know someone that has an old stick they wouldn't mind letting you borrow his or hers, even better. Understand that the men's and women's games differ significantly, meaning that the male stick is much different than the female stick.   There are two main components of a stick:  The head. This is the (usually plastic) piece at the top of the stick that the ball is controlled with. The shaft. Traditionally made out of wood, shafts nowadays are made of strong metal alloys and have varying weights and strength.  ; , If your dominant hand is your right, put your left hand about 1 or 2 inches from the bottom of the shaft and your right hand closer to the top, about 4 inches from the bottom of the head. Switch the hands around if your dominant hand is your left.  Cradling is the lacrosse equivalent of dribbling in basketball. You usually cradle when you run with the ball so that an opponent can't knock the ball out of your stick. Cradling is basically using a curling motion with your wrist to swing the ball back and forth while you run.   Cradling is best learned in front of a mirror. Place the ball in the pocket of your head, so that the ball sits in the mesh, holding your dominant hand a few inches below the head. Hold the stick across your body comfortably. Begin with the head facing the mirror so you can see the ball. Now bring the head across your face while curling your dominant wrist in towards your body. When your dominant wrist is curled as far as it can go inward, start bringing your wrist back out and your arm back down to its starting position. If you managed to keep the ball in the pocket while you completed that movement, you successfully cradled. Keep practicing until you get the hang of it. If you need help (don't worry, it's hard) try watching some videos of people playing lacrosse.  Passing is critical in Lacrosse. It's used to move the ball up field, catch your opponent out of position while hitting a teammate for an assist, or just getting yourself out of pressure. In order to pass the ball:   Lower your dominant hand down to just above the center of the shaft. Keep your non-dominant hand close to the bottom of the shaft. Bring the shaft of your stick back by twisting your shoulders toward your dominant side. Don't let it hook around your neck. Keeping the head next to your ear, and using a straight motion, flick the wrist of your top hand while pulling your bottom hand towards you. Make sure to follow through with the motion. A proper motion will see the top of the shaft move directly over the bottom of the shaft in a straight line.    Note: eventually, you learn how your stick throws and can adjust the way you throw to be more accurate.  Note: the best thing you can do to help improve your skills is get to a brick wall and play "wall ball." This is where you stand a few feet from the wall and throw the ball against it. The ball will bounce back and you practice catching it.  This is all about hand-eye coordination. With your dominant hand up near the bottom of your head,(For righties this means have your right hand on top and left hand on the bottom and for lefties this means have your left hand at the top and right hand at the bottom) watch the ball travel through the air and into your pocket. Make sure you don't cradle as the ball enters your stick. Instead of cradling, simply loosen your grip on your top hand; as the ball enters the stick, let the momentum of the ball push the whole stick back a little bit. Again, wall ball will really help here.  Know that games are won and lost on ground balls. While approaching the ball, step to it using the proper foot: if your stick is in your right hand, position your right foot close to the ball, and vice versa. Sink your hips and put the head of your stick parallel to the ground. The butt of your stick should get down low as well. Scoop through and bring the head to your face. Immediately look for the outlet to a teammate.  Shooting the bass is necessary in order to score goals. Move your dominant hand down a little lower than you would to pass. Perform the same basic movement as passing, except this time, put more force behind it. There are plenty of different kinds of shots in lacrosse — 3/4, sidearm, underhand — but for now, focus on overhand shots.     Try to direct the shots on the corners of the goal. The goalie has a harder time against shots that aren't directed right at him, so aim for top right, top left, bottom right, and bottom left. Also try shooting at the goalies weak side hip. So if the goalie is right handed, shoot at their left hip. Shooting at the goalies weak side hip make it hard for them to stop the ball mainly because it takes a lot speed and quick reflexes for the goalie to extend their arms with the stick across to the opposite side of their body, whether they move their stick upwards or downwards. Try bounce shots. Bounce shots are where you bounce the ball on the ground before it gets to the goal. Bounce shots are hard for a goalie to defend, so use them.  Nothing impresses a coach more than being ambidextrous! Learning to use both hands requires patience, because it will not happen overnight. Using your off hand in games will seriously improve your play.   A good way to learn your off-hand skills is to look at what your dominate hand is doing. Mirror the way you are passing. Go through the same motions. After you do this, spend a week of practice using nothing but your non-dominant hand. During line drills, 6v6, fast break, anything. Only use your off-hand. This will be very frustrating, but keep at it.  There's no one way to defend, but your object on defense is to recover the ball without the other team scoring. You can do this by checking, keeping your stick up and intercepting passes   Boys Checking  Poke-checking: hitting the other person's stick legally with your own, causing the ball to come out. Body-checking: hitting the other person legally with your own body, causing the ball to come out.   Girls Checking  Modified- a quick "tap" (hit and release) on the head of another girl's head of her stick. You can only do this when her head is below her shoulder  Full (Varsity)- a "tap" (hit and release) on the head of another girl's head of her stick. You can check anytime when the girl's stick is not in her "bubble" (around her head).     Intercepting a pass. Anticipate where a pass is going and catch it mid-air or bat it down.  As you play in more lacrosse games, it's important to watch more experienced team members move without the ball. Even players who don't have the ball play a very important role in a possession. You must know when to cut, and make space for passing, and shooting, and to draw defenders away from the person with the ball. You also should learn how and when to set picks for your teammates.  Although the basic concepts are the same, women's lacrosse differs quite a bit from men's lacrosse. This article will focus mainly on the rules of the men's game.  The object of lacrosse is to score more points than your opponents at the end of four quarters, which last for 15 minutes each. You score a point by throwing the ball across the goal line of the opponent's goal.  10 lacrosse players take the field for a game: 3 attack-men, 3 midfielders, 3 defenders, and 1 goalie. They each have different functions:   Attack-men: usually stay in the opponent's half and are responsible for creating fast breaks, moving the ball around in the opponent's half, and scoring goals. Midfielders: move the length of the field, help with attacking and defending, and are responsible for the faceoff. Defenders: usually stay in their half and keep the opponent's players from attacking. Defenders usually, but not always, have longer sticks than other players. Goalie: defends his team's goal, trying to keep the other team from scoring. Has a bigger-than-normal head on his stick for defending his goal.  A faceoff in lacrosse is similar to a faceoff in hockey, except that the two lacrosse players get down on their hands and knees and position their sticks parallel to each other. They then vie for the ball when the referee blows his whistle.  After the faceoff is won, the team with the ball passes the ball until they are close enough to the opponent's goal to shoot. Meanwhile, the defenders try to keep the attacking team from scoring. A shot that travels past the goalie and into the goal counts as one point. Once a goal is scored, the ball is brought back to midfield, where a faceoff takes place again.  The crease is a large circle that is clearly marked. If an offensive player steps into the crease illegally, possession is forfeited to the opposite team.   There is not a minimum amount of time that a team has to possess the ball for before they score. Scoring can and does happen quickly. There is not a minimum amount of passes that need to take place before a player can shoot. Theoretically, a player could march down the field him or herself without ever passing the ball and still score.  There are three rules associated with timing, and they both involve promoting the ball past forward.   After the goalie gains possession of the ball, he must pass or move it out of the crease within 4 seconds. Failure to do so results in a turnover to the other team. Once the defense gains control of the ball in their defending half, they have 20 seconds to pass or run the ball over midfield. Once they've moved the ball past midfield, they have 10 seconds to get the ball into the attack area, which is clearly marked as a big box.  Both involve possession of the ball:   If a player takes a shot and the ball travels out of bounds, the team with a player closest to the end line gains possession of the ball. A player's stick counts as an extension of his body in this case. Inside the final two minutes of the game, the team with the lead must play inside their attack area exclusively. Failure to do so is considered delay of game, in which case forfeiture of possession occurs.  When the faceoff is being fought for, a team's attackmen must be being the offensive restraining line and a team's defender must be behind the defensive restraining line. When possession is gained by either team, both attackmen and defence men may move toward midfield, but both teams must have three players above midfield and four defenders behind midfield.    Offsides. Defensive offsides occurs when there are fewer than four players for one team behind their midfield line. Offensive offsides occurs when there are fewer than three players for one team above their midfield line.  Defenders can move passed midfield and attackmen can move behind it so long as another player stays behind or in front of midfield in their stead. This allows for the possibility of a defender carrying the ball up passed midfield, say, if a midfielder stays back to act as a "defender."    , Penalties usually send players into a designated area called the "penalty box," where they cannot play and must sit for a period of time. There are two kinds of fouls in lacrosse:   Personal fouls. These include slashing, tripping, illegal cross checking, and checking from behind. A player is usually given 1 minute penalties, although penalties can be increased to 2 or 3 minutes or even ejection for egregious fouls. Technical fouls. These don't usually result in penalties, but rather a loss of possession. They include offsides, crease violations, pushing from the rear, thumbing, and warding off.

 Whether one decides to employ a professional software development company or an independent software developer, this choice is a crucial one and can either break or make the project. If the project is large, both offshore and local software development firms can render a complete team of certified professionals, including the project manager. While for small projects, hiring one to two freelance developers may be more monetarily sensible. However, larger corporations prefer to hire software development firms to reduce variability. IT consulting firms give the advantage of specialists working upon your project schedule. These connoisseurs not only interpret one’s business procedure into ‘custom software development’, but also render helpful suggestions to improve them. Since these firms are handled professionally, they execute the entire project on time, without escalating a financial plan, be it e-commerce solution or web based application development.; , Within some definite time duration, you shall be provided with some software products which are best tailored to the needs of your company and field.  Compare the working styles of different firms and then see which approach goes well with the specific requirements of your enterprise.  So, while making comparisons, you have to see which firm is better capable to comprehend and then translate your ideas.  You may want to get maximum results from minimum expenditure, but beware, you do not fall for charlatans during the dream of ‘lost cost’ golden bird.  

decide between hiring a firm or an individual.  visit the official website of the software development firm and request for a quote.  look for the firm that possesses maximum industry experience, and also ask for some samples.  looking for an experienced firm, without actually understanding, is just useless.  remember, one gets what one pays for, neither less, nor more. 

 Some custody agreements forbid parents from introducing new partners on holidays or before a set timeline. Make sure your plans are in line with your agreement. If your relationship with your ex is cordial, you may even want to discuss it directly with them., Don’t surprise them at the Thanksgiving table. Make sure they know who your partner is and that they will be spending the holidays together. If they’ve never met them before, it might be a good idea to introduce them before the holiday. Answer any questions or concerns they have well before the holiday starts, so they aren’t nervous or stressed out., Make sure your new partner knows about any important issues before the holiday, and let them know about any expectations you have. For example, you may want your partner to stay in the background for the first holiday so you can take the lead in planning and spending time with your kids., A lavish gift might make them feel guilty or pressured, so ask your partner to get the kids something small the first time they spend the holidays together. You can coordinate your gifts--for example, if you got your child a new video game system, your partner could get them a game for it. If you are on a very tight budget for gifts, you could get your kids a small gift and your partner could get them a friendly card., Don’t make the holiday a copy of the old one when a new partner is involved. Your kids may resent the implied comparison with their other parent. If your children’s father always dressed up as Santa or made special Hanukkah cookies, don’t ask your new partner to do the same. Keep some of your family traditions, but establish some new ones with your new blended family. 

check your custody agreement.  talk to your kids.  tell your new partner your expectations.  ask your partner to get your children a small gift.  mix old traditions with new ones. 

 We suggest using a strong bristled broom and work your way from the back end of the container. It may be dusty inside, so we also recommend that you wear a dust mask of some form.; , For safety, we recommend wearing some type of goggles or safety glasses. You’re going to be working in a confined area and anything you spray loose may bounce around – eye protection is important. Again, start at the back of the container and work your way towards the doors. Pay special attention to the corners and seams. Also, keep an eye open for any signs of excessive wear in the floor. Once the inside dries you may want to consider repairing any potentially weak spots. After the inside is sprayed out we recommend cleaning the outside next. The high pressure hose will expose and possibly remove any loose paint or corrosion on your container.  If you do find any rust it can be treated with apple cider vinegar or white vinegar, a natural rust remover. Apply the vinegar to the rust and rub it with a cloth or strong brush. If vinegar doesn’t do the trick or isn’t fast enough for you, try rubbing the rust spots on your cargo container with aluminum foil.  Either an orbital sander or belt sander will speed up the process. You don’t need to remove all of the paint, but we do recommend attacking any spots on your container where the paint is peeling, flaking, or showing signs of wear.  The primer coat will help give it a stronger seal and base to prevent any moisture or corrosion in the future.  Most exterior paints will work, however if there’s any question it’s best to ask a professional or sales associate at the place where you purchased the paint.  

make sure that any dirt, dust, or other forms of detritus are removed from your shipping container.  if you have access to a pressure washer, or can borrow or rent one, it will expedite the cleaning process greatly.  inspect both the inside and outside of the shipping container for signs of rust or corrosion.  once the container is completely dry, inside and out, go over the shipping container with a medium grit sandpaper.  after you’ve finished sanding your shipping container, apply a primer coat of paint.  finally, after the primer coat is dry apply a thick, exterior paint to the inside and outside of your storage container. 

 Excel and other similar spreadsheet programs (e.g. Google Sheets) allow you to save time on the math behind these calculations and even offer shortcuts in the form of built-in financial functions to help you calculate compounding interest.  When using a spreadsheet, it's always helpful to be as organized and clear as possible. Start by labeling a column of cells with the key information you'll be using in your calculation (e.g. interest rate, principal, time, n, payment).  , Now fill out the data you have about your specific account in the next column over. This not only makes the the spreadsheet easier to read and interpret later, it also leaves room for you to change one or more of your variables later on in order to look at different possible savings scenarios.  , The next step is to type in your own version of the accumulated interest equation ( A=P(1+(rn))n∗t{\displaystyle A=P(1+({\frac {r}{n}}))^{n*t}} ) or the extended version which takes into account your regular monthly contributions to the account ( A=P(1+(rn))nt+PMT∗(1+rn)nt−1rn{\displaystyle A=P(1+({\frac {r}{n}}))^{nt}+PMT*{\frac {(1+{\frac {r}{n}})^{nt}-1}{\frac {r}{n}}}} ). Use any blank cell, begin with an "=", and use normal math conventions (parentheses as necessary) to type the appropriate equation. Instead of entering variables like (P) and (n), type in the corresponding cell names where you have stored those data values or else simply click the appropriate cell while editing your equation.  Excel also offers certain financial functions that may help your calculation. Specifically, "future value" (FV) may be of use because it calculates the value of an account at some point in the future given the same set of variables you've now become accustomed to. To access this function go to any blank cell and type "=FV(". Excel should then bring up a guidance window as soon as you open the function parenthesis in order to help you insert the appropriate parameters into your function.The future value function is designed with paying an account balance down as it continues to accumulate interest instead of with accumulating savings account interest. Because of this it automatically yields a negative number. Counteract this issue by typing =−1∗FV({\displaystyle =-1*FV(}  The FV function takes similar data parameters separated by commas but not exactly the same ones. For instance, "rate" refers to r/n{\displaystyle r/n} (the annual interest rate divided by "n"). This will calculate automatically from within the FV function's parenthesis.  The parameter "nper" refers to the variable n∗t{\displaystyle n*t} - the total number of periods over which interest is accumulating and the total number of payments. In other words, if your PMT is not 0, the FV function will assume you are contributing the PMT amount across each and every period as defined by "nper".  Note that this function is most often used for (things like) calculating how a mortgage principal is paid down over time by regular payments. For instance if you plan to contribute every month for 5 years, "nper" would be 60 (5 years * 12 months).   PMT is your regular contribution amount over the entire period (one contribution per "n")  "" (aka Present Value) is the principal amount - your account's starting balance.   The final variable, "" can be left blank for this calculation (when it is the function sets it automatically to 0).  The FV function allows for you to do basic calculations within the function parameters, for instance the completed FV function could look like −1∗FV(.05/12,12,100,5000){\displaystyle -1*FV(.05/12,12,100,5000)}. This would signify a 5% annual interest rate which compounded monthly for 12 months, over which time you contribute $100/month and your starting (principal) balance is $5000. The answer to this function will tell you the account balance after 1 year ($6483.70).

 However, when you’re trying to remove political polarization from your life, it’s important to remember that the other side has merits as well.   You likely have a loved one who belongs to the other party, and if you respect that person, you should know they have a reason for choosing the side they are on.; , Just as you have reasons for why you belong to the political party you do, so do other people. Consider people’s backgrounds, religious beliefs, and cultures when attempting to see why they belong to the party they do. Removing polarization from your life is all about accepting other people and their beliefs.   If you know someone who has different political views, respectfully ask why they believe what they do. You could say, “I respect you and your beliefs and am curious why you have the political beliefs that you do. I want to learn about the other side of the political party.” This isn’t the time to argue or confront them on their views. Simply sit back and listen., You’ll need to decide what is more important to you when you have people in your life who don’t hold your political beliefs: changing their minds or keeping the relationship. If you want to maintain the connection you have, you may just need to agree to disagree on the subject. This could mean avoiding talking about politics at all.   If your loved one attempts to engage you in a political conversation in which you know conflict could occur, you could say, “Out of respect to you and our relationship, I don’t think we should talk about politics. We have different beliefs and points of view and it seems that we argue when we discuss them. I want to continue having a good relationship with you and I think talking about politics threatens that.” They may be upset at first, but they will likely understand over time. 

avoid assuming the other side is “wrong.” when you characterize yourself as one political party, it’s difficult not to think that the other party is wrong.  attempt to see the other side’s point of view.  agree to disagree on politics. 

 If your scars are depressed or pitted, then you may need a dermatologist's help in removing them. Different types of scars respond well to different types of treatment.Rolling scars are sloped. They may give your skin a wavy appearance. Boxcar scars are broad with well-defined ridges. Icepick scars are small, narrow, and deep.; , Mild or moderate scarring can be smoothed out using lasers. Ablative lasers vaporize the scar so that new skin can form in its place. Non-ablative lasers are used to stimulate collagen production to repair the skin around the scar.This treatment works best with rolling and shallow boxcar scars. Book an appointment with your dermatologist to discuss your options and talk about the potential risks and side-effects.  If you have icepick or boxcar scars, your dermatologist may be able to remove them by using punch techniques. They will cut out the area around the scar and then allow it to heal into smooth skin., Acne scars can leave permanent indentations in your skin which are impossible to reverse. Filler injections can temporarily fill these indentations to help even out the skin's surface, but need to be repeated every four to six months., Silicone sheets or gels can help reduce raised scars. Apply the silicone to the scar every night. Wash it off in the morning with a gentle cleanser. Over the period of several weeks, the skin will become more even. 

identify what type of scar you have.  get laser treatment.  ask your dermatologist for punch excision.  consider getting fillers.  cover raised scars with silicone. 

 To access telepsychiatry as a patient, you should speak to your primary care doctor and get a referral. You can also get a referral for a telepsychiatrist from a mental health clinic in your area.You may provide several reasons why telepsychiatry will benefit you, such as your remote location, your mobility, or your desire for a psychiatrist with flexible hours. Your doctor should be able to help you find a telepsychiatrist that will meet your needs.; , Before you use telepsychiatry, you should make sure this service is covered by your state’s medical insurance. Many states do not reimburse patients for telepsychiatry, through this is changing and will likely shift in the future. Call your medical insurance provider to check that you can get your telepsychiatry appointments covered.If telepsychiatry services are not covered by your healthcare provider, you should speak to your doctor or to a representative at the mental health clinic to ensure you know the cost of the services before you access them.  When you use telepsychiatry, you have the option of having sessions from the comfort of your home computer or at another location, such as your doctor's office or at a mental health clinic. You should consider which option is most convenient for your schedule. Due to immobility or your remote location, sessions from your home may be easier to arrange than sessions at another space.   You may start by going to sessions at a clinic or your doctor's office so you can get used to telepsychiatry in a monitored space. You may then switch to doing sessions at home once you are comfortable with using telepsychiatry.  Once you have a referral for a telepsychiatrist, you may have the one-on-one video conference with the specialist in a clinic or your doctor’s office. You may be set up in a room in a mental health clinic or in a private area at your doctor’s office that is set up for the session.Many telepsychiatry appointments can be set up through a clinic or your doctor within an hour of requesting one. This helps to cut down on the average wait time in a clinic and makes it easier for you to get the help you need as soon as possible., Another option is to access the telepsychiatrist from the comfort of your home. The telepsychiatrist may be able to set up a video chat with you through your computer at home. Make sure your computer has a working microphone and a webcam so you can chat comfortably with the telepsychiatrist.You can also opt for a voice only chat if you do not want to have to address the telepsychiatrist via video. This option is ideal if you are experiencing paranoia, anxiety, agitation, or have a cognitive disability and do not want to use video.  The telepsychiatry session will run the same way as an in person session. You can discuss your mental health issue in detail with your telepsychiatrist and create a treatment plan with them. Doing this over a video or voice chat can make it easier for you to get the treatment you need fast.For example, you may tell the telepsychiatrist, "I am struggling with depression" or "My mental health issues have not been improving on my current treatment plan." You can also be prescribed medication during the telepsychiatry session. The psychiatrist may recommend medication as part of your treatment plan, in addition to lifestyle changes., You can book follow up appointments or check ins with the telepsychiatrist, if necessary, during the session. You may decide to schedule a follow up appointment the following week or once every two weeks.   The telepsychiatrist should be able to advise you on how often you should be scheduling sessions with them. You may ask them, "How often should I be seeing you?" or "When should I schedule our next appointment?"  

get a referral for a telepsychiatrist from your doctor.  check that telepsychiatry is covered by your medical insurance.  decide if you are going to do telepsychiatry at home or at another location.  arrange the session at a clinic or your doctor’s office.  access the telepsychiatrist at home.  discuss your issue and get a treatment plan.  schedule a follow up appointment.

 Aside from the lower costs of adopting through a non-profit shelter or rescue facility, it’s worth noting some other facts about these types of organizations. They house 6 to 8 million animals annually, only half of which will be adopted. Many of these dogs were not placed in these facilities at any fault of their own, and many are ready and capable to join your home safely and happily., Some adoption agencies work with one type of dog breed in particular. If you're hoping to adopt a dog of a certain breed, look online for agencies that specialize accordingly.Meanwhile, it's important to note that roughly 25% of the dogs cared for by all dog shelters are purebred. In fact, many breed-specific organizations operate by matching interested people with purebred dogs being held in regular animal shelters.  Rescue dogs are often not only immunized and fixed, many are also house trained. Many shelters also work to ensure that dogs are socialized with one another, as well as with people. Whatever each dog’s personality, the facility or foster home that’s caring for them will provide you with their behavior analysis.Ask about how an organization trains their dogs and what information they have on a particular dog’s behavior. This will help you choose not only a caring adoption agency, but just the right dog. In fact, adoption staff may help you identify aspects of your lifestyle that will help you choose a dog.  Most importantly, many of the dogs at adoption facilities are well-behaved and capable of being further trained. However, you should not assume that an adoption facility has correctly assessed a dog’s breed. Staff, including veterinarians, often simply guess dogs’ breed based on appearance alone.Some dogs with certain types of breed heritage are more or less likely to have been correctly identified. In fact, DNA analysis almost always reveals a different genetic heritage than the breed that was assessed visually.  

default to animal shelters and rescues.  consider a breed-specific rescue organization.  look for a dog whose behavior will match your lifestyle.  expect imperfect breed analysis at many adoption facilities. 

 Trace the top of a flower pot on a sheet of 1½-inch (3.81-centimeter) thick foam. Cut it out just inside the line that you drew. Wedge the foam disk into the pot, ¾ inch (1.91 centimeter) from edge.If you'd like to paint your flower pot, do it before adding the foam disk. If the disk is very loose, secure it with some glue around the edges.  Press down on the eggs as you roll them. This will help you create a pill or capsule shape, and make it more cactus-like.If you can't find any Styrofoam eggs, you can buy some Styrofoam balls, and saw down the sides instead.  For a more natural-looking cactus, try to use small, medium, and large eggs. For a small, simple cactus, use just one egg.  Insert 1 to 2 toothpicks into the narrower end of each egg. Press the toothpick end of one egg into the side of another egg. Keep doing this until you have assembled your cactus. The toothpicks will act as anchors and help keep your cactus together.Put the smaller eggs on top, and the largest one at the bottom. Avoid making your cactus too big, especially if you are using a small flower pot.  Insert two toothpicks into the bottom of your cactus. Coat the disk with a layer of glue, and press the cactus into it., Mix 1 cup (100 grams) of all-purpose flour and 1 cup (240 milliliters) of cold water in a bowl. Consider adding 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 grams) of salt to prevent mold.Stir everything together with a spoon.  You can also make papier mâché glue by mixing equal parts of white school glue and water., Gather some soft paper, such as newspaper or newsprint. Tear it into different sized strips, about ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) wide and 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) long.  It might be tempting to cut the paper, but tearing it is actually much better because it allows the paper to blend together more smoothly.  Press the paper against the cactus, and smooth it out with your fingers. Keep applying strips in a similar fashion.  As you move on to your second layer, you may not even need to use any glue. Use smaller pieces of paper on the curves and seams.  Cut the ends off of several toothpicks down to 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Poke the toothpicks, flat-end-first, into your cactus at random.Try to do this while the papier mâché is still wet and pliable.  If it is too hard to insert the toothpicks, poke holes into the cactus with a skewer first, then insert the toothpicks. Add a drop of glue at the end of each spike before inserting it to help it stick.  This may take a few hours to even overnight, depending on the conditions in your home. The cactus will dry faster if it is warm and dry. You can help speed up the drying process by setting it out in the hot sun., You can paint it using acrylic paint or tempera paint. For a smoother finish, paint the cactus with primer or gesso first.You can use one shade of green, or several different shades for a more natural look.  Consider sealing your cactus afterwards with a an acrylic spray sealer. This will make your work last longer.  Cut squares out of pink tissue paper, then scrunch them over the end of a pen or pencil to create a cupped flower. Glue the base of each flower to your cactus.  Don't want pink flowers? Try red, orange, yellow, or white.  To prevent the "soil" from getting all over the place, paint the disk around the cactus with glue, then sprinkle your desired soil on top. 

cut a disk out of styrofoam, and wedge it into a flower pot.  roll several styrofoam eggs across a table to flatten the sides.  assemble your cactus.  attach the cactus to the pot.  prepare your papier mâché glue.  prepare your papier mâché strips.  cover the cactus with two layers of papier mâché.dip your first strip of paper into the glue, and run it along the edge of the bowl or between the prongs of a fork.  insert toothpicks into the cactus the make the spikes.  let the cactus dry completely.  paint the cactus, then let the paint dry.  add some tissue paper flowers, if desired.  add some sand, pebbles, or rice to the flower pot, if desired. 

 Write down your ideas, or draw sketches on paper, so that you have a better picture of it.   If you have an idea for a design, sketch it! Paper and pencils are not difficult to find and it is better to do this before you forget. Modification is the biggest step. Carry a sketchbook around with you at all times. Pin in fabrics you like, label colors and fabrics you will want to use. Note down anything you find inspirational. Make a portfolio to hold your designs. You might need them later on.; , Keep up to date with the latest fashions by checking out books, subscribing to fashion magazines, checking fashion sites, etc. Learn how the business works.   Spend some time digging through old and new fashion magazines; you can get some ideas and inspiration from previous designs. Look at sewing patterns and clothing catalogues too. See if you can take some lessons in your spare time about fashion, sewing or drawing. Search the web for fashion courses for 13 to 17 year olds at reputable fashion colleges and schools in the USA and Europe or in the Arabian Gulf.  To be a fashion designer you will need to have some experience in actually making clothes.  Go through department stores and fabric shops hunting for fabric that you love that is not too expensive.  Try altering clothes you already have, and even making your own! Wearing your own designs will be one of the best ways for you to advertise. Here are a few simple projects that you can try out:   Make an Umbrella Skirt Modify Your T Shirt Make a Summer Dress out of a Bedsheet Recycle an Old T Shirt Into a Sexy Bikini Make Easy Pants Turn an Oversized T Shirt Into a Hot Mini Dress Go through your mom's old stuff (if she doesn't mind!). If you see a shirt that has great sequins you can cut the sleeves off for example. Re-design those out of date items and make them fresh.  Create a catchy logo that appeals to your target market.  Make sure that people know about your talents:   Offer to design outfits or even prom dresses for your friends. Wear your creations to school every day. Partner up with a school club when they do a fund-raising sale and offer to donate some of your outfits to be sold. Look into opening a shop on etsy.com, a site that hosts thousands of shops that sell hand made goods and that's compatible with teens. Start soliciting feedback from friends, family, and online fashion communities. A great way to get started is submitting your sketches and completed samples to fashion design competitions like SocialAttire.com, modclothes.com, and other sites you can find on Google. Maybe even start your own website for your fashions, or get a friend who is good with computers to help you do so. Start a YouTube channel to show off your latest clothes! Ask the teachers and administrators at your school to consider doing a fashion show to raise money. Design your own creations and show them off! Wear your fashion and be your fashion.  Ask them if you should add anything or remove anything to make your designs better.  A lot of devotion, time, stress, and effort goes into becoming one; and it doesn't happen overnight. It's something you work at, and don't give up on. It has to be something you love and want to be and have success in.  

come up with your own style.  learn about fashion!,  learn how to use a sewing machine.  purchase fabric.  practice sewing and making clothes.  design a label for your clothing.  advertise your clothing!,  ask your friends what they think of your designs and get their opinions.  have extreme passion, and drive to become a fashion designer. 

 You'll just sit there thinking about your work.   Spend at least one hour before bedtime relaxing your mind in preparation. Do this outside of bed. Dim the lights, and avoid television, computer, and phone screens. You're trying to quiet your mind.; , Just as a warm bath, a bottle, and a bed-time story lets a baby's body know that it's time to start winding down, a set, relaxing routine before bedtime will train your body to start relaxing.Take a relaxing bath.Add a few drops of one of the essential oils, such as rose or lavender, to help yourself relax. Read a set amount of a good book. Only read one chapter a night — don't let yourself get sucked into reading through the night. Listen to calming music. The British Academy of Sound Therapy has put together a playlist of the most relaxing songs according to science. Their playlist includes artists such as Marconi Union, Coldplay, and Enya.  Believe it or not, a glass of warm milk might really help you sleep better. Dairy products are high in tryptophan, an amino acid that helps make you feel sleepy.You may also enjoy the sedative effect of an herbal tea, such as chamomile, passion flower, or valerian root.Avoid beverages that have caffeine, including some teas. Green tea and black tea tend to have fairly high levels of caffeine, so choose an herbal tea that says “caffeine-free” instead. Avoid alcohol before bed. While it may help you fall asleep faster, alcohol also reduces your REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, which can make you feel unrested when you wake up the next morning. It may also cause sleep apnea, which further disturbs your rest.Cherries contain natural melatonin, a compound that helps your body fall asleep. Try drinking a small glass of tart cherry juice before bed., Some people may find eating a small snack before bedtime helps them sleep. Doctors recommend a small, carbohydrate-rich snack to increase your levels of tryptophan. Try a slice of toast or a small bowl of cereal.Don’t eat a huge meal before bed. Your digestive system slows down when you’re asleep, so having too much food in your system can cause heartburn or could even cause you to choke. One study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that eating a small bowl of jasmine rice -- a complex carbohydrate that digests slowly -- four hours before bed helped participants fall asleep more quickly than a quickly-digestible carbohydrate.Avoid snacks that might have caffeine, such as chocolate. You should also stay away from foods that are very high in sugar, as these may make you feel more awake and jumpy. Other snack foods that may help include bananas, eggs, peanuts, oats, and yogurt. They all contain tryptophan.Bananas also contain magnesium and potassium, which can help your body relax., Though different people will have different preferences, everyone should make sure the blinds are drawn to block out any light that may come through the windows. Light in your bedroom may keep you from falling asleep.Set the temperature to your ideal sleeping temperature. Some people like it warmer, some like it colder — figure out what you like. Use aromatherapy if you find that relaxing, though some will find it cloying and distracting. Do not light a scented candle, as it could be very dangerous if you fell asleep before extinguishing the flame. Try a scented oil reed diffuser or something like a Glade plug-in.  Change into designated sleep clothes that don't restrict your comfort or movement. Some people hate the feeling of high collars when trying to sleep, while others can't bear sleeves. Some people need socks to warm their feet, while others can't stand it. Figure out what works for you.Consider the fabric choice for your sleeping attire. Cotton fabric is lightweight and breathes easily. Silk allows your body to regulate its temperature effectively. Bamboo naturally wicks away moisture.If you want to sleep nude, go for it. Especially if you’re prone to overheating while you sleep, going au naturel could help you sleep more comfortably.  This will block out any unwanted light that might be drawing your attention away from sleeps. Cooling sleep masks are often especially relaxing.  Concentrate on your breathing and how it feels in your body. If you find your mind wandering, acknowledge it and bring your attention back to your breathing.Close your eyes. Inhale deeply through your nose for four to five seconds. Hold your breath for a comfortable amount of time (try to count to “7”). Exhale purposefully, controlling the rate of exhalation instead of letting all the air just rush out of your lungs. Try to exhale for a count of “8”. Repeat this sequence three times.  Studies have shown that learning mindfulness meditation can significantly improve the quality of your sleep.Mindfulness focuses on accepting your experiences in the moment without judgment. These techniques can be especially helpful when you find your mind wandering.Lie in bed. Prepare with your breathing exercises. Continue breathing deeply as you proceed. Check in with your thoughts. Just see what’s going on in your mind. Don’t try to “stop” thinking or resist your thoughts in any way. Accept their flow. Check in with your body. Focus your attention on where your body makes contact with the bed. Is your weight distributed evenly? Are there any places where you feel discomfort? Check in with your senses. What do you hear? What do you smell? What do you feel? Determine whether these sensory experiences are things you can change or things that are out of your control. If you can’t control the noise, acknowledge this. Return your attention to your body. Do a “scan” from head to toe. Observe any areas where you feel discomfort, tension, or tightness. When you notice tension, remind yourself that you will soon be asleep, and that rest will relax you. Also notice any areas where you feel pleasant or comfortable. Go through your thoughts, starting at the beginning of your day. Take about three minutes to review your day in a focused way. Allow yourself to “replay” the events, thoughts, and feelings of the day, but don’t get wrapped up in them. Acknowledge that each happened and then move to the next thought or event. Finally, “switch off” your body. Go through your body from toes to head. Focus your attention on one part of your body, such as your feet, and tell yourself “time for sleep” or “switch off.” Proceed up through your body until you reach your face. Once you have told your whole body to rest, relax and drift off. Dr. Deepak Chopra has a video tutorial for a mindful sleep meditation.The UCLA Mindful Awareness Research Center has a downloadable MP3 “sleep scan” meditation., Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) helps you relax your body by intentionally tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups throughout your body.It can be very helpful in teaching your body to completely relax before sleep.   Lie down and close your eyes. Begin with your feet. Tense the muscles in your feet by curling your toes downward and clenching as hard as you can for about 5 seconds. Then, exhale as you release the tension. Allow yourself to feel the difference for about 15 seconds, then move to the next muscle group. Move up to your calves. Tighten your calf muscle by sticking out your heels and pulling your toes up towards your face. Hold this position as tight as you can for about 5 seconds. Exhale as you release the tension. Enjoy the relaxation for 15 seconds, then move on again. Repeat the tensing and releasing process through the rest of the muscle groups: leg, hand, arm, buttocks, stomach, chest, neck and shoulders, mouth, eyes, and forehead. Dartmouth and Brigham Young University offer downloadable PMR audio exercises on their websites.You can also find helpful videos on YouTube.  Counting sheep is an old standby, by it’s generally too “active” and requires too much concentration to put you to sleep.Instead, try picturing a relaxing scene that you find pleasant and soothing. Studies have shown that this type of “imagery distraction” helps you fall asleep faster and sleep better.Begin by closing your eyes and imagining yourself in a restful, calming place. This can be anywhere: a waterfall, a beach, the woods, anywhere where you have felt peaceful and relaxed.“Color in” as many sensory details as you can. What does the place look like? What are the various sounds and smells? What can you hear? What are the textures and touch senses you feel? Imagine yourself in your restful place. You don’t have to “do” anything there, but if you do choose an activity, go for something steady and rhythmic that mimics your breathing, such as rocking in a hammock, rowing a boat, or walking on a path., Your brain processes sounds even when you’re asleep. Playing ambient sounds or “white noise,” such as a waterfall or raindrops, can help your brain “tune out” other background noises.Some people do better with “pink noise,” a combination of sounds that increase and decrease frequency.Avoid sounds with words or other information that your brain may try to process. Don’t listen to music with words or have the TV on when you’re trying to sleep. Experiment with what works for you. You may find that jungle noises or the sound of waves on a beach is more soothing. Others may prefer soft mechanical noises. You can purchase a white-noise machine or download one of the many apps for your phone or tablet. Commonly recommended apps include Lightning Bug, Sleep Fan, White Noise, Sleep Bug, and Chroma Doze., If you have done all these activities and you still don’t feel sleepy, don’t stay in bed fighting the frustration. This may actually key you up and make it more difficult for you to get to sleep later. Instead, get up, go to another room, and do something relaxing for a little while.Don’t do anything too stimulating, like watching TV or doing physical activities. Keep the lights dim. Bright light will keep you awake. Try reading or listening to soft, soothing music for a few minutes. When you start to feel drowsy, go back to bed.  Just as your body will start keying down if you have a regular bed-time routine, it will also start keying down if you have a regular sleep-schedule from day to day.Don't stay up till 2 a.m. one night, then wonder why you can't fall asleep at 10 p.m. the next. Choose a reasonable bedtime that will allow you to get the recommended 7-8 hours of sleep you should be getting each night. Experiment with when you need to go to bed and wake up to feel most rested. This can vary from person to person. Try to go to bed at the best time for you every night.  If you use your bed all the time — when you're reading, when you're working from home, when you're watching TV — then your body won't think of it as a place to shut down and sleep. Use the other rooms in your house during the day, and return to your bed only when you're ready to sleep in it., It's good to work through the problems that might keep you up at night be writing them down in a journal. This will help you vent frustrations, and maybe even help you work out solutions to how to fix these problems.   Don't do this right before bed, as that will keep your worries fresh in your mind. Do this before the hour of relaxation that should precede bedtime.  If you're letting your body rest during the day, it won't feel the need to wind down at the end of the day. Even if you're tired during the day, push through until bedtime.If you must nap, set a timer for 15 minutes.That's all you need to restore your alertness and energy — anything beyond that is overkill. Try to avoid napping after 5 PM., If your mattress is making your back hurt, or your pillow is making your neck hurt, you'll never get to sleep. If you can spare the cash, it's worth it to buy a mattress that will help you get the rest you need.Go to a mattress store and try out several different beds. You must be able to test the mattress, preferably for at least 5 minutes. Figure out if you need a firm or soft mattress, and buy the mattress that works best for you. You should feel comfortable on the mattress.  

take time to unwind from the day before trying to get to sleep.it does you no good to go straight from working on last-minute details for your job to trying to get to sleep.  create a pre-sleep routine.  drink something soothing.  eat a small snack.  prepare your room for an optimal sleeping experience.  choose comfortable clothes to sleep in.  wear a sleep mask.  begin with relaxing breathing exercises.  practice mindfulness techniques while lying in bed.  try progressive muscle relaxation.  try visualizing a relaxing scene.  listen to ambient sounds.  don’t fight yourself.  develop a regular sleep schedule.  don't lounge around in bed during the day.  write down your worries earlier in the day.  don't take naps during the day.  invest in a high quality mattress and pillows. 

 These items can be used for defense by swinging them (like the players in the aforementioned sports) and use them to try to knock people down or stun them.; , There are 2 things you can do with these. One is to wear the helmet and headbutt the burglar. The other is to hold them in your hand and swing them. ,,, A glass bottle can be used by smashing it over the trespasser's head to cause pain and give you time to find a means of restraint.  The latter method causes more pain but is slower to be able to swing again. It is also an effective method of restraint.  A loaded paintball fired at close range causes a lot of pain and a strategically placed shot to the groin can incapacitate the trespasser.(NEVER aim above the shoulders unless you want to possibly get in trouble with the police.)  , BB guns and air rifles look a lot like real guns to the untrained eye and should be able to persuade an inexperienced burglar to flee or surrender. If the burglar is not buying it (i.e he knows it's not a real gun) then use them same way as the paintball gun.  A sliced lemon should be used to squeeze citric acid into a trespasser's eyes which should blind them and give you some time. , Slip them over your hand and use to punch. If the shoe is a tall lady's one then you can hold the leather and swing it.  A cattle prod can be used to shock people into submission. However it should NEVER be used unless you fear for your life. If you do need to use it aim for the limbs or abdomen, never aim at the torso or head.  A small hole punch can be slipped over your hand and used like makeshift knuckledusters. Make sure the lower bit is on the flat of your fist as this is far less painful to you than placing them on your knuckles.  can be used if you take a swig and hold it in your mouth. When needed, spit it as hard as you can into the trespasser's face which will either temporarily blind or distract the trespasser as well as freak him out.  Firing water at high speed from a pressure washer at the trespasser is a good tactic because it hurts and it distracts along with temporary blinding if fired at the face.  Use the handset by having it held in the hand and swung downwards to make a good bludgeon but this will probably break the phone.  

use a cricket bat/2x4/baseball bat.  strike back with an american football helmet/bike helmet.  garden hose tubing: garden hoses can be used if you tie a knot in it and set it around your hand and it makes your punches harder.  ,  bed sheet/duvet: bedsheets and duvets can be used to temporarily blind and distract the assailant by throwing it over their head.  ,  perfume, deodorant, antiperspirant or hair spray can be used like mace by spraying it into the trespassers eyes.  ,  fight back with a glass bottle.  use a belt like a whip, by either holding the 2 ends together and hitting with the leather or by swinging the belt buckle end.  use a paintball gun.  use a bb gun/air rifle.  try using a sliced lemon.  pepper can be used to blind an assailant as well.  ,  use shoes with wooden soles as a weapon.  use a cattle prod with caution.  consider using a small hole puncher.  try to distract the intruder with fruit juice (preferably apple juice.),  consider using a pressure washer as a firing weapon.  use a telephone as a possible weapon. 

 These can be simple, general words like beautiful, special, and unique, or more descriptive words that are specific to the person, like dark haired, smart, and bold.This list will help you brainstorm lyrics for the song. So, don’t get too focused on working all of these words into a lyric. The idea is to start to build the vocabulary and lingo you’re going to use for the song. Because you're likely writing the song to please the object of your affections or compliment her, focus on positive words and phrases that you think she would enjoy hearing in a song about her.; , This will help you determine which phrases have good implied rhythm and roll off your tongue easily.   Put the phrases that sound good out loud into a list called “Possibles”, as they have lyrical potential.  Consider if there are any other phrases or words in your list that rhyme or almost rhyme.   See if you can create a line or phrase that seems to answer an idea or question in your “Possibles” list.  Aim for a general topic or phrase and don’t worry about being overly creative or descriptive. The title will likely change as you compose the song, but a working title will help you focus on a main theme or idea.  The most common contemporary song structure is: verse/chorus/verse/chorus/bridge/chorus. Most listeners like this song form because it is catchy due to repetition, but varied enough to be engaging and interesting.A verse in a song has the same melody but different lyrics. The verse paints a picture of a scene, a situation, an emotion, and/or the subject(s) in the song. The chorus usually appears three or four times throughout the song, depending on how long the song is, and the lyric and melody remain the same each time it recurs. The chorus lyrics should sum up the heart of the song or the overall message. The title of the song may also appear in the chorus. The bridge has a different melody, lyrics, and chord progression from a verse or chorus. It provides a break from the repetition of the verse and chorus. The lyrics in a bridge often provide an insight or revealing moment. The bridge can also add on to or extend an idea or thought in the verse or chorus.  Often, the question to be answered in a song is: “What does this feel like?” or “How am I feeling?”Don’t forget to also try to integrate the title of the song in the chorus. For example, in the popular Bruno Mars song “Treasure”, he focuses on how special and “treasured” the girl is to him. In the chorus, he sings: “Treasure, that is what you are/ Honey you're my golden star/ You know you can make my wish come true/ If you let me treasure you/ If you let me treasure you.”In the chorus, Mars reinforces the main idea of the song with other adjectives that play off of a treasure, such as “golden star”, while also keeping the lines short and to the point, as well as including the title of the song.  If you’re focusing on the physical beauty of a girl, describe this in the chorus. If you’re focusing more on your experiences with a girl or your desires for a girl, be sure to sum up these feelings in the chorus.   If we use Mars’ “Treasure” as an example again, he makes several direct statements in the chorus of the song, such as “that is what you are”, “you know you can make my wish come true” and “if you let me treasure you.” In these phrases, he directly addresses the object of affections and tells her exactly how he feels.  Structure your verses around the ideas in your chorus lyrics. Try to answer the question you picked or idea you’re focusing on in an open, honest way, and avoid formal or complicated language.For example, in Mars’ “Treasure”, the first verse is: “Give me all, give me all, give me all your attention baby/ I got to tell you a little something about yourself/ You’re wonderful, flawless oh you’re sexy lady/ But you walk around here like you wanna be someone else.”In this verse, Mars starts the conversation with the girl by telling her to give him her attention because he has something to tell her. He then tells her he think she’s “wonderful” “flawless” and “sexy”, but notes she doesn’t seem to realize how valuable she is (“wanna be someone else”). So, this verse ties into the idea of treasuring her, or seeing her worth and valuing that. It’s a good introduction to the main idea of the song and lets the listener know what they’re in store for.  To create a good melody, you need good pitch, phrasing, and rhythm. When you talk, you are likely already displaying all of these elements. But in a song, these elements are exaggerated and there is more repetition. So singing the lyrics will help you find a melody that is suitable for a song.Use the melodic element of speech to give your songs added emotional impact. Changing the pitch in your voice so it goes up at the end of a question or flattens out when you’re being sarcastic will add emotion to the song.In most songs, the chorus will sound more urgent than the verses, and it will use a higher note range. So try to raise the pitch of your voice when singing the chorus. In Mars’ “Treasure”, he adds in an “Oh whoa-oh-oh” before the bridge to give the song a sense of urgency and melody.Don’t be afraid to add “ohs” or “ahs” to the chorus or bridge to add emotional impact.  Strumming along to a guitar or playing a piano or keyboard as you sing your lyrics will help you create chords and chord progression.Using an instrument to compose the song will also help you find the right pitch for the melodies in the song. If you don’t play an instrument, ask a friend who does to play along as you compose. If you’d like to learn how to play chords on a guitar or piano, there are several learning methods available online., This will ensure you are comfortable playing the song live and can pour all your feelings and emotion into your performance.  Depending on how personal the song is, it’s always best to get an outside opinion of your creative work.   Try to show the song to someone who is close to the girl you are interested in, or who knows her well and can give you specific feedback about whether or not she would appreciate it.  Maybe you want to demonstrate a very public display of affection by performing the song spontaneously in a public place or perhaps you’re more into the idea of an intimate performance in a romantic setting. Whichever way you decide to present the song, make sure you do so confidently, honestly, and full of feeling.  

create a list of words that relate to the girl you are writing the song for.  arrange these words into phrases or statements and say them or sing them out loud.  try to work the “possibles” list into longer lines or connecting lines.  create a working title for the song.  use basic song structure.  focus on answering the most important question or stating the main idea of the song in the chorus.  make at least one direct statement that describes what the song is about in the chorus.  keep the verses simple and conversational.  sing your lyrics out loud to find a melody.  use an instrument to help you put the song together.  play the song from beginning to end several times, preferably with an instrument.  show the song to someone else for feedback.  set the scene and present the song. 

 One of the best reasons to have home phone service is safety. The first safety reason is in the event of a Hurricane or Tornado or heavy storm. Home Phones normally work in such bad weather situations because they have their own electricity source contained in the home phone line. So even if the electricity goes out in the area, landline based home phones still work with a simple cheap handset. The second Safety reason is landline phones don't give off all the radiation that a cell phone does.; , You may only need to be able to call people in your city or you may want to be able to call all over the country. Check rates for both. And consider using your cell phone for long distance (inside of USA) to keep your costs even lower.  There are only a few options for landline home phone service in Texas cities, the largest being ATT. One of the cheapest discount providers is Section 8 Phone service, and they offer discounts for people on limited income. Expect to pay anywhere from $10 per month up to $60.  Once you decide on a carrier, then sign up for service. Some carriers require a deposit while others do not. Pick the extra services you need like call waiting or caller ID among others. Just read the forms when signing up so you know the rates. Ask for any special offers too.  When picking a phone device for the house, a handset, be sure to get a plain corded one and IF you want a cordless one. The corded one does not require regular home electricity and will work even if the electricity in the area goes out. Installation usually happens within 3 to 7 business days and may require some wiring inside of the house - so check with your service provider about their rates for inside wiring.  Enjoy your services but be aware of long distance charges or any limits on minutes of talk time. Discuss it with your family members, especially children. You may even consider blocking long distance calls.  Knowing that your children can call you from home and you can call them at home and that your phone will work even when the neighborhood's electricity is out is a good feeling.  

decide if you need home phone service.  decide what type of service you need.  shop around.  sign up.  buy a home phone and wait for install service.  use the service and careful of charges.  feel secure about your texas home phone service. 

 Every salesperson has a sales target he or she is expected to meet. In all honesty, practically every salesperson has a sales target he or she is expected to exceed. Creating an individual sales plan helps define the strategies and tactics that will be utilized to meet and exceed the target.Start your plan by establishing your sales target — weekly, monthly, yearly, or otherwise — and then outline several overarching strategies that you will use to achieve it. Strategies for enhancing sales might include increasing awareness in the community, obtaining more referrals from existing customers, or adding to your number of weekly “cold calls” to potential customers.  If the strategies you lay out are your general guidelines, then the tactics you describe are the specific ways in which you will make more sales.For instance, if one of your strategies is to increase community awareness, your tactics may include attending a set minimum of community events and volunteering at least so many times per month / quarter / year in the community. If one of your tactics is to enhance your social media presence, you should provide specific details. For instance, how many social media posts do you intend to average per day?, For many engaged in the sales business, holding onto current customers is as vital as recruiting new ones. Here again, you want to begin by laying out some key strategies that you will employ, then add some specific tactics which you will utilize.One strategy, for example, may be to increase your opportunities for at least monthly interaction with each of your existing clients. If so, your tactics could include calling once per month with a relevant idea or tip, setting up an interactive newsletter, or taking a minimum number of existing clients to lunch per month.  Obviously you want to at minimum retain your existing sales with existing clients. Even better, however, is to mine this fertile ground for increased sales with existing clients and new sales to additional clients.Your strategies here could in fact be listed as “increase sales within my existing client base” and “identify new clients through my existing client base.” Your tactics could include meeting with the key decision-maker for every account you hold, scanning client social media outlets daily for useful news, or including promotional materials with every delivery of goods or services.  Individual sales plans should be brief, and generally shorter than sales business plans. One page is a reasonable length. For clarity and convenience, straightforward subject headings and succinct, specific bulleted points are recommended.Simple and direct is key. You want something you, your boss, or anyone else who wants to look can scan quickly and understand. Think of it as something you can (and may actually want to) post on a bulletin board. Simple and direct plans are also easier to revise as times and circumstances change. You should indeed revisit and revise your individual sales plan regularly. Consider the following example for four possible subject headings for an individual sales plan. Each section would include three to five bulleted strategy or tactic examples:I. New Business Acquisition Strategies II. New Business Acquisition Tactics III. Existing Business Growth Strategies IV. Existing Business Growth Tactics    

consider what you can do to reach your sales target.  define your tactics for increasing sales.  determine how you will stay relevant to current customers.  explain how you will “prospect” within your existing customer base.  lay out your individual sales plan. 

 You will have more success spending time with your dog if you plan your activities into your day and week. Schedule times that you will feed, walk, and play with your dog. This schedule will also benefit your dog by giving them structure in their day.   Dogs should generally be fed twice a day, walked one once or twice, and taken out often to eliminate. They are also social creatures and will want to spend time with you while you are home.; , Dogs can cut into your social life. While you can still go out, you will have to plan ahead to make sure that your dog's needs are met.For example, if you know you are going to be working late one day, ask someone if they would be willing to walk your dog for you. If you are leaving on a weekend trip, find a friend to dog sit.  While you should have a regular schedule, you do not have to plan your entire day around your dog. Your dog may not mind if you come home late one day or if you miss your weekly dog park visit for an appointment, as long as you do not do it too often.  An easy way to increase the time you spend with your dog is to let them join you on your daily tasks. Whether you are at home or out doing errands, you can fit the dog into your lifestyle. You can:   Take the dog on car trips. Talk to the dog while doing chores.Visit the pet store together. Take the dog with you to the beach or park. Ask your friends if you can bring your dog when you visit.  Spending time with your dog should not feel like a chore. Appreciate your dog, and remember that they are a member of your family. Express gratitude to your dog for their love and loyalty, and reward them with your attention.   Occasional treats when your dog has behaved well is a great way to surprise your dog. Some people like to give holiday or birthday gifts to their dog. You can even find specialty dog treats at certain pet bakeries and stores. You might consider bringing your dog on holiday with you. While you will have to find transportation and lodgings that allow dogs, the quality time and memories you make together will be invaluable.  

set a routine.  plan ahead.  be flexible.  include the dog in your daily activities.  give your dog their due. 

 On the flip side, when your purpose is clearly defined, it’s easier to move forward into the action phase.   If you have become detached from your purpose, sit down and reevaluate the principles, people, and causes that drive your life. Make a point to fill your day with activities that bring meaning to your existence. If they don’t, toss them or delegate them. For instance, public speaking might fill you with anxiety, but you are more likely to push past this fear when you are speaking about a cause close to your heart. Add meaningful challenges to your day to take action against anxiety.If public speaking still fills you with anxiety, take on smaller challenges first and build your way up to speaking in public. Do not start with your biggest fear or worry. Instead, start with smaller concerns to help yourself build confidence.; , Goal-setting is another way to use your anxiety as fuel. Take notice of your anxious thoughts and worries. What are you most concerned about? What are your biggest fears? Instead of shaking in your boots, get to work developing a plan that allows you to overcome these fears.Let’s say you are worried about failing your algebra class. You can take action against this anxiety by creating an action plan to minimize the likelihood of it coming true. You might have steps like “Find a math tutor,” “Ask the instructor for extra credit,” or “Spend two hours studying each day.”  , After you have determined what your goals are, you must immediately move forward into fear. Oftentimes, anxiety-sufferers spend too much time planning without ever bringing those plans into fruition. To prevent yourself from getting stuck in analysis paralysis—that is, worrying about which next step is the right one—just take a step forward. Identify one small action you can take to move you closer to reaching your goal and do it.For example, in the previous example, you might need to “Find a tutor” to improve your math grades. Don’t spend too much time analyzing how to obtain a tutor. Consider the simplest route forward and take it. Send an email to the tutoring lab at your school. Ask a clever classmate. Or, catch your instructor’s eye after class to see if they have a recommendation.  Anxiety often debilitates us because we keep quiet about it. We keep our worries and fears close to the vest out of concern that others will think less of us, or take advantage of our shortcomings.   It requires vulnerability, but you may find that talking about the source of your anxiety with a trusted friend or acquaintance may help you view it more objectively. As a result, you might receive advice or encouragement that propels you from paralysis into action.Reach out to someone you trust and speak candidly. You might say, “Hey, Tom, I know this might come as a surprise, but I have a fear of heights. Our flight next week is really freaking me out.” Don't stop yourself from confiding in other people by overthinking it and assuming your friend will judge you. Choose someone you trust, and try talking to them.  Think of your resilience to anxiety as a muscle. The more you use the muscle, the stronger it becomes. Rather than avoiding those situations that provoke anxiety, gradually expose yourself to them more often. When you do this, you will find that, over time, they lose their power.Don’t let fear and avoidance make you complacent. Make an effort to build resilience by challenging yourself to face your anxiety regularly. For instance, if you loathe public speaking, you might benefit from signing up for a local Toastmasters club. Doing so will allow you to practice speaking in front of a group more often, which will reduce your anxiety. Don't necessarily start with your greatest fear. Getting over smaller anxieties first can build your confidence.  

refocus on your “why.” when you become disconnected from your personal mission or purpose, experiencing anxiety can immobilize you.  set a goal.  take the first step.  seek advice from others.  challenge yourself regularly to build resilience. 

; , Wipe down and scrape off any dirt that needs removing. You'll be roasting with the peel on, so it needs to be clean.  Scoop out the seeds and discard.  Cut each half into cubes (or near enough shapes) about 2cm/1 inch in thickness.  Place in the roasting dish, skin side facing down. Sprinkle the cubes with a seasoning of choice (dried herbs, paprika, spicy mix, etc.).  Bake for 15 minutes.  Sprinkle with sea salt flakes. Turn the pieces over, then return to the oven.  Tenderness can be tested by sticking the point of a knife or a fork into the pieces; if it gives easily, the cubes are ready to serve.  Serve with a plate of other vegetables and meat, fish or a nut roast.  

preheat the oven to 230ºc/450ºf.  clean the outside of the butternut squash.  cut the butternut squash in halves.  prepare the butternut squash cubes.  brush the wedges with olive oil.  place in the oven.  remove from the oven.  bake for a further 15 minutes, or until tender.  serve. 

 A defensive reaction puts you in a fight-or-flight mode: this means that your body will show physical signs and put you in a state of heightened tension. Try to learn to recognize these signs. That way, you’ll be able to nip any defensiveness in the bud when it starts.Ask yourself: is your heart speeding up? Do you feel tense, anxious, or angry? Is your mind racing to come up with counter-arguments? Have you stopped listening to others? Look at your body language – what is it like? People who are feeling defensive often reflect that in their body language, crossing the arms, turning away, and closing off their body to others. Do you feel a strong urge to interrupt? Rest assured that one of the biggest giveaways that you’re being defensive is saying, “I am NOT being defensive!”; , Your body is less able to take in information when it’s in a heightened state of tension. To counteract the body’s fight-or-flight reaction, try to bring your nervous system down by slow, measure breathing. Calm yourself before you do or say anything.Inhale slowly to the count of five and exhale again to the count of five. Make sure to take a long, deep breath after your peers have stopped talking and you start. Give yourself space to breathe when you talk, as well. Slow down if you are talking too fast and racing through points.  Interrupting to dispute someone’s point or criticism is another big sign that you’re being defensive. This is not helpful and makes you seem insecure and pigheaded. What’s more, it’s an indication that you still haven’t gotten your emotions under control.Try counting to ten every time you have the urge to butt in. After ten seconds, there’s a good chance the conversation will have moved on and your rebuttal won’t be relevant. Increase the count to twenty or even thirty if you are still tempted. Catch yourself when you interrupt, as well. Stop speaking mid-sentence and apologize for your rudeness, in order to build up your discipline.  If your emotions are too heightened to have a reasonable exchange, consider excusing yourself and asking to pick up the conversation later. You won’t get much from a talk with co-workers or family members if you can’t listen to what they have to say. This doesn’t mean avoiding the conversation – it means postponing it.   Say something like, “I’m really sorry Cindy. We need to have this talk, but right now is not a good time for me. Can we do this later in the afternoon?” Make sure to affirm the importance of the conversation while excusing yourself, i.e. “I know this is an important topic to you and I want to talk about it calmly. But right now I don’t feel so calm. Can we try later?  , When you’re defensive, your body is under elevated levels of stress. To help yourself calm down, find ways to relax and release that tension. This will not only help you manage the extra stress but can also help you improve your wellbeing.Relaxation techniques can help you slow your breathing as well as focus your attention. Try yoga, meditation, or tai chi, for example. You can also try more active ways to relax. Working out through walking, running, sports, or other forms of exercise can have similar stress-reducing effects.  

recognize the physical signs of defensiveness.  take deep breaths.  don’t interrupt.  ask to have the conversation later.  find ways to beat stress. 

 Just like you, your toddler needs to brush twice a day; however, your toddler can't be trusted to brush their teeth alone, even if they're going through an independent streak.Most kids won't brush thoroughly. Rather, they'll stick to the front part of the mouth, ignoring the rest of the teeth, which is why you need to take over.If your child insists on brushing their own teeth, you can let them, then take a pass at it yourself to make sure you get all their teeth brushed.; , You can only use a small amount of toothpaste because kids have a tendency to swallow it, especially if it produces a lot of foam. Children two and under should have their teeth brushed only with a soft brush and water. Children between two and six should brush with a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste made specifically for kids. Make sure you're also using a toddler-sized toothbrush so it fits your child's mouth.Check to see that your toothpaste has fluoride in it, as that helps protect against cavities and tooth decay.If, for some reason, you don't have access to children's toothpaste, then use a dab of regular toothpaste only about the size of half of a pea. Your toddler's toothbrush should be replaced every three months., To make it easier, brush your toddler's teeth on your lap. You can reach the whole mouth better, making it likelier that all of your child's teeth will get brushed. Hold the brush at a 45-degree angle to the gum line, and brush all of your toddler's teeth equally, making sure you get the parts of teeth facing inward as well as the parts facing outward.Move the brush in tiny circles across the teeth, rather than back and forth, as that is better on your child's gums.As your child gets used to having you brush their teeth, try doing it with them in front of a mirror so that they can see proper technique. Hold your child's hand in yours and guide their brushing so they can also feel what the motions of proper brushing technique feel like. Make sure you get all the food out of your child's teeth as you brush. Singing a little song or telling a story while you brush can help pass the time more quickly.  When your child turns two (approximately), they should be able to start learning to spit after brushing. Instruct them to spit in the sink. You can even show them how to do the behavior. Don't let them rinse first, as that will increase the likelihood that they will swallow the toothpaste.You can have your child rinse after they spit.  Foods like crackers and cereals are high in carbohydrates. They turn into sugars, which can harm your child's teeth. Toddlers have a less mineralized enamel than adults, and the risk of cavities is higher. This is especially true if they eat a lot of sugary foods and don't have good oral hygiene. Try limiting how often you give your child these snacks to help cut down on tooth decay.Also, try to avoid sugary snacks like candy or ice cream. Keep those as a special treat.   Instead, pick snacks like cheese or avocado slices.When you do give your child sugary foods, try giving them to your child during a meal. That way, the sugar is mixed with other foods, causing less harm to your child's teeth. If your child does eat sugary snacks, ask them to wash their mouths afterwards to help get rid of the sugar. Brushing is even better., You may avoid giving your child candy because you know it can cause problems with their teeth. You may not know that juice can be just as bad, particularly if your child drinks it often. Water is a much better choice, as it keeps your child hydrated without soaking their teeth in sugar.Baby bottle tooth decay is a particular case which may also affect toddlers' front teeth if they used to drink a lot of milk or sweetened liquids. One way you can slow down sugar intake is to dilute juice with water.  Having a regular snack and meal schedule gives your child times when food is not working on their teeth. If your child snacks all day long, this causes their mouths to constantly be in an acidic state, which can damage enamel and lead to tooth decay. Try to space out eating, leaving as long as 90 minutes to two hours between eating., Letting your child have a bottle at night means that milk will sit on your child's teeth.As it sits on your child's teeth, it turns to sugar. Over time, that can lead to tooth decay, even in young children and babies. Therefore, it's best to avoid putting your child to bed with a bottle.In addition, giving your child a bottle at night can lead to choking issues. Never put sugary drinks in bottles, even during the day. That allows the drink to sit on your child's teeth., Switching to a regular cup prevents your child from walking around with a bottle in their mouth. Constantly having it in their mouth leads to sugar staying on their teeth if they're drinking a sugary drink. By about one year of age, your child should be using a normal cup if possible., Some parents like to add honey or sugar to their child's pacifier to make it more attractive for the child; however, doing so leaves sugar on your child's teeth, which can lead to tooth decay. It's best to skip this practice altogether and just give your child a regular pacifier., While some activists have questioned the importance of fluoride in water, fluoride is an important component in keeping your child's teeth healthy, and just brushing with it won't do it. Your child also needs to get it from other sources, such as from drinking tap water.In the past, most cities put fluoride in the tap water, but some have stopped adding it, so check with your public water system to find out. In addition, you will want to ask about the percentage of fluoride to make sure it is not too high — check with your dentist to learn what is an appropriate amount for your child. If your child doesn't get it from tap water, your dentist should have fluoride supplements that can be taken instead. Fluoride is beneficial only in certain quantities — it is possible for your child to get too much fluoride, which can cause dental fluorosis, harming developing permanent teeth.  Everyone has different germs in their mouths that cause tooth decay, and you can pass those germs to your kids; therefore, it's important that you don't share items with your kids that go in your mouth, such as spoons, toothbrushes, and forks., Just like adults, children should go to the dentist often, usually twice a year, though some kids may need to go every three months.Find a kid-friendly dentist who will work with your child even if they have fears about going to the dentist. Consider asking other parents with kids who they use.Your child's first dental visit should be at about six months, or when your child gets their first tooth, so you may be able to wait up to a year in some cases.One way to help calm a child's fears about the dentist is to let the child know you will stay in the exam room with them the whole time. Hold their hand to feel safe during the consultation and make their experience easier. If the dentist will not allow you to be in the room with your child, then choose a different dentist. If your child is afraid, talk to them about what exactly they're afraid of. Once you know what's causing their fears, you can help find a way for them to deal with them. Ask about sealants. Your child's dentist can put sealants on their teeth to help protect them from bacteria. Ask your dentist if they provide this service.  

brush your child's teeth twice a day.  put a small amount of toothpaste on the brush.  have the child lay their head on your lap.  teach your child to spit.  limit snacks that are high in carbohydrates.  skip sugary beverages.  discourage all-day snacking.  take the bottle away at bedtime.  have your child switch to a regular cup.  skip sugaring the pacifier.  have your child drink water with fluoride.  don't share utensils or toothbrushes.  take your toddler to the dentist frequently.

 Split the bun in half and toast lightly in the oven or toaster oven.; , This step is optional as you could just as easily consume this burger with egg by itself and you'll still be happy.   Create a cheeseburger. Find a nice slice of cheddar or Swiss to top the burger. Or use two types of cheese for a more tasty variation. Prepare any cold toppings such as lettuce, tomato, pickle or onions. Clean and dice toppings beforehand so you can swiftly put the burger together.  This small hole in the middle of the burger patty is needed for placement of the egg. To make the hole, push a drinking glass into the center of the burger patty and remove the cut middle portion.  Make sure you have enough meat to not only create the entire burger but also to make a hole in the middle for the egg.  Flatten the hamburger meat on top of a piece of parchment paper to avoid having it stick to the countertop.       Create a hole in the middle of the hamburger meat with the drinking glass. Spray the drinking glass rim with cooking spray (to stop it sticking to the meat) and press the rim down in the middle of the burger. Remove the glass and lift out the middle portion of the burger to create a hole.  Lightly add salt, pepper and any other desired seasonings.  Lift the burger from the parchment paper with a spatula in order to keep the burger shape intact.  Then crack the egg and deposit it gently into the hole in the middle of the burger. Keep the egg in the middle hole and avoid spilling it over the meat.  Flip the burger on the other side and cook. Be careful when flipping the burger so that you don’t disturb the egg, cracking the yolk.  If you're planning to add the cheese, make sure you do it while the meat is still in the pan. That way, it will melt and blend into the burger.  Consider adding a topping like ketchup, butter, mayonnaise or any other desired condiment.  Place the opened, prepared bun on a plate and carefully transfer the meat/egg combo from the skillet to the bun.  Now is the time to add lettuce, tomato or other cold ingredients. You can also re-top with ketchup or additional condiments.  This burger tastes best when transferred immediately from the pan to your mouth.  

toast the hamburger bun.  assemble toppings if needed.  find a drinking glass to create a hole in the middle of the hamburger.  flatten the hamburger meat.  season the patty with salt and pepper.  place the hamburger in a heated skillet coated with cooking oil.  allow the hamburger to cook for a minute.  cook the burger until it has browned on one end.  add a slice of cheese when the burger is almost completely cooked.  season the hamburger bun.  transfer the cooked patty to the toasted hamburger bun.  add burger toppings.  serve warm. 

 Gather parsley before the first flowers start to open, and gather it in the morning after the dew has dried. It will have maximum flavor at this time of day; the heat of the afternoon will diminish the parsley's flavor. Alternately, purchase fresh parsley at a grocery store. Choose bright green bunches of parsley that look nice and smell fresh. Don't pick parsley that is shriveled, brown, moldy, or is dried out. Carefully cut the parsley with stems still attached, and be careful to not bruise the leaves.  Use cold water to rinse, and then shake the parsley gently to remove excess water from the leaves. This will remove any residual dirt, as well as any bugs that crawled into your parsley.  Place a paper towel on a plate and place a single layer of parsley leaves on it. Then cover the leaves with another paper towel.  Watch them constantly to ensure that they do not burn. If the parsley is not fully dry, gently toss the parsley leaves to ensure it is drying evenly. Microwave the leaves for another 30 seconds.   Times may vary depending on the model of your microwave. Follow the instructions for your microwave. , 

harvest fresh parsley from your garden.  rinse the parsley.  cover the parsley with paper towels.  microwave the leaves for 30 seconds.  store the dried parsley in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.  finished.

 Many states require certification, which often includes training at a qualified auctioneer school.; , Find out who local competitors are. Visit their websites, and attend some auctions to find ways to compete. Local auctioneers may deal with specific geographic areas or items. Some ways to differentiate from the competition include targeting a specific town or specializing in certain items. Since many auctioneers only sell high-end items, holding auctions for vintage or used goods instead of antiques could be an opportunity.  This is one of the best ways to learn the business. Local competitors might be hesitant to give you tips, but auctioneers in other geographic areas may be more willing to share. Join groups and societies both online and offline to learn more.  This may be required to get an auction license for your state, and even if it isn't, it's a good way to learn how to start an auctioneer business. Schools usually offer short training periods of a week or so. You will learn about voice techniques and bid calling, as well as aspects like advertising and state laws.  This will be part of your job in evaluating items to sell. Books, journals, and comparing items on online sites like eBay will help develop your appraising skills so that you can quickly get an idea of how much items can sell for.  Some auctioneers travel and hold auctions on-site. Another option is starting an auction house, where you collect items to sell on commission or buy them outright. This type of auction business requires more overhead since you'll need space for storage and a budget for purchasing items.  Part of the appeal of auctions is that they are fun for participants. Write a few jokes and use humor to draw in the crowd's attention. Inflect the pitch of your voice for added excitement.  Aside from state licensing, you may need to get permits and licenses to run a local business. You'll also have to find out how to register your business with the state and the IRS.  Create a website with information about your auction business. List upcoming auctions, including items to be sold, on your website and in local newspapers. Offer services like free appraisals to prospective customers.  

find out about your state's auction license requirements.  evaluate the competition.  network with other auctioneers.  get training at an auctioneer school.  learn how to appraise items.  decide how to run your auction business.  learn to overcome stage fright and to provide an entertaining atmosphere for auction attendees.  seek assistance from local officials and a business adviser or attorney.  advertise your services. 

 You may have been able to maintain a healthy weight in your 20s with a brisk morning walk around the block. However, as you age, the same cardio routine will become less effective.Cardio can help you lose weight – especially around your middle – while at the same time slowing muscle loss and keeping you strong. To promote weight loss, don't walk or run with the same intensity the whole time. Intervals can step up the calorie-burning power of your cardio exercise. For example, if you're walking for exercise, walk at a brisk pace for five minutes, then break into a light jog for two minutes, then slow back down to brisk walking for another five minutes. If you listen to music in headphones while you walk, you can design a playlist with varying beats that corresponds to your intervals and pushes you forward.  In your 40s, you start losing muscle mass. Building stronger muscles means you burn more calories every day – even when you're sitting at your desk doing work.Many women avoid adding strength training to their workout routine because they are afraid of bulking up or looking like a body builder. However, strength training really isn't going to do this. Building bulk muscles involves a different type of weight lifting than the work you will do with strength training. Basically, you can strengthen your muscles simply by adding some resistance to the exercises you already do. Even if your exercise routine consists of little more than a walk around your neighborhood after dinner, you can add a strength training component by using wrist and ankle weights for short periods of one minute at a time. Wearing wrist and ankle weights for too long can injure your joints.  Doing little things to stay active, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator, can help you keep your body active and enable you to burn additional calories throughout the day.Look for opportunities to get a little exercise into your daily routine. For example, if you go to the grocery store or the mall, you might park further away instead of looking for the closest spot. When you're shopping, carrying things in a basket or bag instead of pushing a cart is another way to sneak in a little exercise. Even cleaning around the house can burn a few calories, while at the same time giving you a sense of satisfaction that you've made your home a neater and more comfortable place to live.  If you stick to the same exercises day in and day out, you'll get bored after a while – and your body will too. Changing your routine doesn't just keep you mentally engaged and motivated, it keeps your muscles alert and active.If you have the time and the ability to do so, you might consider taking a fitness or exercise class to add a little variety to your exercise regimen. Joining a community sports league is another way to add variety, and you don't need to be a skilled athlete to do so. Many areas have adult leagues for sports such as kickball in which everybody can participate. Your local YMCA or community center may offer inexpensive exercise classes if you don't want to join a gym just to take an exercise class.  As you get older, your risk of injury while exercising increases. Even if you can't afford a personal trainer every day, consult an expert at least once every few months to go over your exercise routine with you.When you explain your goals to a personal trainer, they can assess your exercise routine and let you know if the exercises you've chosen will help you fulfill your goals. A personal trainer also can suggest additional exercises or tweaks to your routine that will kick your fat-burning up a notch. If you're stuck in a workout rut, a personal trainer can help motivate you and push you over the next hurdle to keep your weight loss on track.  

increase the intensity of your cardio workout.  use strength training to increase muscle mass.  incorporate exercise into your daily routine.  switch up your exercise routine regularly.  work with a personal trainer.

 A great way to start a graduation speech is by greeting the members of the audience. This includes fellow classmates, teachers, parents and family members, administrators, and the principal.You could say something like “Good afternoon Principal Jacobs, teachers, staff, family, and most importantly my fellow graduating class.”; , Although your classmates and teachers will already know who you are, some parents and relatives in the audience may not. For example, you could say “My name is Melissa Smith and it is an honour to have the opportunity to speak at our graduation.”, Think back on the past school year and your time in middle school. You could talk about your first day of school together and how you have all changed over the years. For example, you could talk about lifelong friendships that were made, and lessons that were learned.   Encourage your classmates to always remember and cherish the good times you had together.  Did your class go on any big trips together? Were there any notable athletic or academic achievements? Did your class participate in a successful fundraising drive, or plan a major school event together? Try to think of a few memorable events that you could highlight. Tell a short story about one of these experiences.  Be sure to choose a story that brings the entire class together. For instance, you could say “During the fall charity drive, our class made history by raising over three thousand dollars.”  , After you have reflected on your time together in middle school, you could talk about how these experiences have prepared you and your classmates for the future. Mention your nervousness about entering high school and meeting new people.  Before ending your speech, you should take some time to thank those people who made your middle school experience possible. This includes peers, teachers, parents, administrators, and staff.Say something like: "I want to thank the teachers, staff, Principal Nolan, and, of course, my parents for a wonderful Lemon Valley experience. Without your support and guidance we would not be where we are today." You could add: “I would especially like to thank my classmates for making middle school one of the most fun and rewarding experiences of my life."  , The conclusion can be one of the hardest parts to write. You want to leave the audience with something meaningful. For example, you could end by wishing your classmates the best of luck in high school. Alternatively, you could choose to end with an inspirational quote.  As the valedictorian you are representing your entire class in the speech, not just your own experience. Avoid speaking in the first person as much as possible and try to share stories that are relevant to the entire graduating class.  For example, you should say “We will always remember when Mr. C. made a perfect dunk on the basketball court” instead of “I will always remember when Mr. C. made a perfect dunk of the basketball court.”  , You can elevate your graduation speech by adding in a few jokes to lighten the mood. For instance, you could poke fun at one of the teachers or tell a funny story that happened during class. Do not add too many jokes to your speech. You want to try and create a balance between funny and serious.  Avoid making insulting jokes that may offend someone in the audience. You could tell a quick story that highlights a funny moment from the last year. For example, "Mr. D was so eager to come to school and teach us that one day he wore his shirt inside out."  , Although it is important to thank your teachers and peers, you should avoid talking too much about individual people. For example, you may cause certain people to feel left out if you spend too much time talking about a few individuals.That being said, it is okay to give a tribute to someone if they deserve special recognition. For example, perhaps the entire graduating class had the same teacher. In this instance, you can mention that teacher individually.  People do not want to sit and listen to a thirty minute graduation speech. They will likely lose focus and only remember a few key stories anyways. The best graduation speeches are short and to the point. Keep your speech somewhere between ten and fifteen minutes., Motivational quotes can help to give extra meaning to your words. They can also be used to help inspire your classmates. Search online for motivational quotes and choose one that is relatable to some experience or theme that you are building your speech around.Alternatively, you could choose a quote that was hung on your classroom wall and talk about how you can apply this quote to future successes.  You can elevate your speech by adding a bit of wisdom or advice for your friends to take with them as they enter high school. The advice you give can be funny or serious, but it must be sincere.For example, you could quote a piece of advice from a celebrity commencement speech. Alternatively, you could say something serious like "The journey ahead may not be easy, and most of us will stumble at some point. The important thing is that we get back up and keep working towards our goals and dreams."  , Make sure that you say your speech out loud at least five to ten times. Practicing will help you remember the speech, make you comfortable saying the words, and ease some of your nerves. You can also try practicing in front of your family. This will get you comfortable talking in front of a group of people., On the day of your graduation you will likely be nervous and talk faster than in rehearsal. The slower you practice the easier it will be to control your speed while giving the speech. Time yourself when you practice so that you have a general idea of how long it should take when you are speaking at a slow pace., While you are delivering your speech, your mouth will likely become dry as a result of your nerves. Make sure to drink a glass of water before you deliver your speech. This will help you avoid getting dry mouth while you are talking., In order to connect with the audience, you want to avoid staring at a piece paper the entire time. Instead, you should make eye contact with the audience. This will make your speech more engaging and entertaining for members of the audience. Try to memorize parts of your speech so that you can look up from your notes., When you are delivering the speech, stand up tall and be confident in your words. Make sure that you genuinely believe the words that you are saying, this way people are more apt to pay attention and listen to the speech. If you stumble on a few words, that is okay. Just repeat what you said and keep going. 

greet the audience.  introduce yourself.  reflect on your time in middle school.  highlight a few important moments.  talk about the future.  thank those who made middle school a great experience.  create an impactful conclusion.  avoid using personal examples.  include a few jokes.  don’t talk too much about individuals.  keep your speech between 10 to 15 minutes in length.  add a motivational quote to the speech.  give a few words of advice.  practice the speech in advance.  concentrate on speaking slowly and clearly.  drink a glass of water before you deliver the speech.  make eye contact with the audience.  be confident and sincere. 

 Depending on the game, the locations and situations on finding an Eevee is different.  In Pokémon Diamond, Pearl and Platinum, the first Eevee is given as gift from Bebe in Hearthome City. The second is found by going to the Trophy Garden and talking to Mr.Backlot (only some days). Note that you may need the National Pokédex to get one. In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, Eevees can be found on Route 115 as hidden pokemon.  

before you start, you'll need to find an eevee. 

,,,,, Grind off the buckles from inside the bag and pull the buckles away from the bag.This will allow the stiffener to lie flatter against the leather. If you feel confident about pop riveting or bolting the buckles back on then go ahead and grind off the buckles. Otherwise it is not absolutely necessary to remove the buckles., You also can substitute luan, or 16ga-24 ga metal in place of the plastic. The purpose of the plastic is to keep the bags shape once the bag is dry. Apply one coat of contact cement to the inside front of the leather bag and one coat to the stiffener. Let dry. Apply another coat. Push the pieces together almost immediately after applying the cement. Do not let the cement dry before pushing the pieces together. Work fast. Drill 5/32" holes through the leather and stiffener to provide holes for pop rivets or small bolts(8-32 used with acorn nuts), use washers under the bolt or pop rivet head and washers on the other side as well to increase the holding strength. Use three across the top of the front and a couple lower down. Paint the rivets or bolts if desired to help disguise them . Also install two on the right side and two on the left side of the top. To reinforce the sides, cut plastic strips about 4-5" wide x12" long and cement from the top of the sides. Secure with pop rivets or small acorn nuts and bolts.  

soak the bags in hot water for 30 seconds in a laundry sink or bathtub.  ,  stuff the bags with newspaper.it will take at least one sunday edition.  ,  when wet, mold the top back into shape.  ,  leave to dry for at least one day.  ,  take out the newspaper.  ,  optional step.  if you want to maintain the shape longer you can put stiffeners in as follows:  cut out the shape(pattern) of the flat saddlebag top piece and the saddlebag front from the plastic sheet, making the pattern 1" smaller on the outer edge so the plastic piece fits onto the top and front. 

 Before you can learn to play the organ, you must have some experience on the piano. In fact, many organ teachers will not accept you without at least one year of piano training. Begin your journey by learning about the keyboard on the piano. You must first understand what the various keys do, and which notes they can produce.   The keyboard of a piano repeats its notes from top to bottom across several octaves. This means that the notes change from low (left side) to high (right side), but don't vary in pitch. There are twelve notes a piano can produce: seven white key notes (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) and five black key notes (C-sharp, D-sharp, F-sharp, A-flat, and B-flat).; , Playing scales (a series of notes) is the cornerstone of mastering piano technique. Learn some basic piano scales, starting with simple two-finger scales and then advancing to three-finger scales. Practice your piano scales every day.  As organ is considered an advanced instrument, most teachers will expect you to be able to read sheet music before you begin organ study. Learning to read music can be challenging at first, but it is a crucial skill for mastering any musical instrument, including piano and organ.   Learn about the treble clef. Move on to the bass clef. Learn about the parts of the note (the note head, the stem, the flag). Learn about meter and rhythm.  Once you have become comfortable with piano scales, and perhaps started playing some simple compositions, you must learn to use each of your hands independently. Eventually, you must be able to play two different movements (one with each hand) at the same time. This simultaneous playing must be mastered before you can advance to organ play.  

learn about the keyboard.  play scales.  learn to read music.  practice using your hands independently. 

 You should be able to see inside.  A phillips head works fine as well, but a flathead is easier to use. , If you are in the right spot, then you should be at the gear mentioned in the previous method.   To know if you are in the right spot, look at Furby's ears and eyelids. They should move slightly every time you spin the screwdriver.  Most likely he will start right up!  

push down the beak.  get a small flathead screwdriver.  insert the screwdriver to the left of the beak and push it down as far as it can go.  ,  spin your screwdriver to the left.  once you feel that you have spun it enough, put batteries into furby. 

 To obtain a satisfactory IELTS Band Score, it is necessary to be realistic. If the goal is to reach a certain level of English proficiency, success can only be achieved with much practice. It is important to know what an IELTS score in any of the Sub-tests means before you set yourself a goal.; , Set aside the maximum number of hours you can spare each day to practise English for all four Subtests. Do not concentrate only on your weakest areas. Be regular in your practice, and give yourself a rest between tasks. Take at least one day out of your week to rest and forget the test completely.The secret of success is to work towards your goal slowly, steadily and regularly.Take every opportunity to listen to English whenever and wherever you can. Watch TV programmes and films, listen to radio programmes and English language tapes - even songs in English on tape.Have as many conversations with native English speakers as you can, and practise in English as often as possible with your non-native English-speaking friends.Try to read texts in English at least once every day. You should always be in the process of reading a book in English - a page or two each night before bedtime is an excellent plan. Read newspapers,magazines, and novels written for your English level (available from good language bookshops). Academic Module candidates should obtain academic articles, if possible. Always carry English texts with you, so you can read when you have spare time that would otherwise be wasted.Do not worry about understanding every word. Read some articles in detail and some for speed.  In the IELTS test, time is your enemy. Candidates who have taken the test and did not perform as well as they had hoped often complain that they were unable to give all the answers in the Listening Test because the tape was too fast, and that they ran out of time in the Reading Test. To begin with, do not worry if you do not finish the tests. Remember, the test is designed to measure candidates over a range of scores from 0 to 9 (0 indicates the test was not attempted). Candidates whose English is near perfect can expect to score 9, but even native English-speaking people would be unlikely to complete every Listening Test answer perfectly or finish the Reading Test a long time before the examination ends. Remember, the test is meant to be challenging. The IELTS test measures many aspects of your English ability including the speed at which you listen, read, write, speak, and think in English. Your personal speed is not something which changes a great deal from day-to-day, but does change considerably over a longer period of time, as a direct result of practice in working with the English language.Your personal speed and ability in the 5 areas previously mentioned is pretty well fixed at any given time. The official IELTS Band Scores you receive are extremely accurate, since each test is trialled extensively to achieve standardised results for candidates at all English levels. Nonetheless, there are certainly many things you can do, before and on the day of the test, to help maximise the use of your time and give yourself the best chance of success. Consider the following situation: although a racing car cannot go faster than its maximum speed, the race can still be won, and its maximum speed maintained for longer, if an expert driver is at the wheel.The Listening, Reading, and Writing Tests are given in that order, and are usually held on a single morning. The combined length of those three tests is 2 hours and 30 minutes. (The Speaking Test is conducted at an appointed time in the afternoon.) Only one short break is given between the Reading and Writing Tests, so you need to be at your best for a long period of time, which is why you must sleep and eat well before the test. The hints and guidelines in this book should help you achieve your "maximum speed". The more effort you put in, the faster your personal speed will be on the day.  The faster and more accurately you read, the more questions you will be able to answer. In all the tests, the instructions, the example, and the questions themselves need to be read quickly, and must be well understood in order for you to have more time to find the answers. It pays to increase your overall reading speed  , In the Reading Test, it pays to remember as much as you can of what you have just read, but at least the words can be read again. However, in the Listening Test you cannot go back, and the tape is only played once. If the answer comes before the keyword/phrase, your memory of what you have just heard is even more important. Nevertheless, the answer usually follows the keywords/phrases that you hear, and is close in time to the main keyword/phrase you are listening for.  The tape is heard once only, and the questions are answered as you listen. Time is, therefore,managed for you, but you have a short period of time after each passage is heard to check your work.Do not use this time to transfer your answers to the Answer Sheet because you are given 10 minutes at the end of the test in which to do this. The Reading Sub-test. An advised period of time is usually given in which to complete each of the three sections of the test. Keep an eye on the time as you progress through the Reading Sub-test, and as you complete each question group. Make sure that you stop answering questions when the advised time is up. Move on to the next group of questions even if you have not finished those questions. If you do not, you will probably not complete as many questions as you could. Remember that you are in charge of managing your time in the Reading Sub-test.  If a monkey asks for a banana, you must give him a banana and not an apple. In other words,your answer to a question must be exactly what is required. You must be quite sure of the type of information you are asked to give as an answer, and what you must do with that information to give an accurate answer. You might think that this advice is too simple to be worth remembering. It might seem obvious that you have to do what the test asks you to do and give the answers the test asks you to give. Yet failure to remember and apply the Golden Rule is one of the main reasons why candidates do not score as well in the test as they believe they should. Read the questions very carefully. Know the type of information the test asks you to give: Is the answer a method of transport? ... a person? ... a place? ... a number?If you know, you have a better chance of giving the correct answer. Know what you have to do with the information:Do you have to complete a sentence, or fill in the missing words in a sentence? If so, your answers must, therefore, be grammatically correct within that sentence.Do you have to provide an answer with no more than a maximum number of words?If so, your answer must not contain more than that maximum number of words.Do you have to name two items that you must hear on the tape, or find in a reading passage? If so, your answer must contain two items only; three items would be incorrect. Always know exactly what type of information you need to give and what you have to do with it.  The instructions may contain information about the passage topic which helps to predict what you may hear or read. The instructions tell you what to do, what kind of answer to give, and, in the case of the Listening Test instructions, they tell you when to answer. It is important to read the instructions quickly and accurately. You might not have time to complete the test if you are too slow at reading the explanatory information.  It is important to read and/or listen to the example carefully. Some candidates believe they can save time by not looking at the example. This is a mistake. If you do not know how to give the answer, you are very likely to give an incorrect answer or a correct answer in the wrong form.The example tells us 3 very important pieces of information about the task:1. The example tells you how to give the answer to questions.2.The example gives you information about the listening or reading passage.3.The example tells you when to start listening, or where to start reading to find the answers.  This is true for both the Listening and Reading Sub-tests. First, you must choose which word or phrase to listen for on the tape, or search for in the reading passages. There may be more than one keyword or keyword phrase in a question, and they can be placed before or after the answer. , In the Listening Sub-test, you are given a minute of silence after each section has finished. Candidates who forget to give a logical guess to questions they cannot otherwise answer, do not give themselves any chance at all to get a mark!  , While it is true that not all words and phrases given as answers to questions in the Listening and Reading Tests need to be grammatically correct, it is often possible to work out the correct answer by using your knowledge of grammar. Always consider whether your choice of answer is grammatically acceptable before making your final decision. This is especially true of the following types of tasks: short-answer question tasks•all table/chart/diagram/note completion tasks• sentence completion tasks • gap fill tasks.Verb forms, plural forms and other grammatical forms can be important when you give Listening and Reading Test answers. A good rule is to always try to give the answer in correct grammatical form.  Even if one of the multiple answers you give is correct, you might score zero if too many of the other answers are incorrect. Surprisingly, candidates sometimes give more answers than necessary! If you are asked to name just three items that you hear or read about in a passage, it makes no sense to give four items as your answer. You will score zero, even if all four items are correct. Remember the Golden Rule.Note that with short-answer questions, especially in the Listening Test, there is sometimes a variety of words or phrases that can give the correct answer. However, you waste valuable time if you give more than one of the correct answers to short-answer questions. Alternative answers are given to various questions in the Answer Keys for the Listening and Reading Tests contained in this book.  It is only necessary in the Listening Test if a word answer is spelt out for you on the tape.Other correct answers in the Listening and Reading Tests can be incorrectly spelt and still count towards your Band Score, but they must be sufficiently well spelt to indicate the correct answer.Copy answers from the passages accurately in the Reading Test. In the Listening Test, if you are unsure of the spelling, write an approximation of the way the answer sounds.  Candidates may be unaware that their answers cannot be understood by the examiners who mark the tests. Be careful!Words: If you have trouble with English letters, you could write your Listening and Reading Test answers in BLOCK LETTERS.Your letters must be distinguishable from each other. Pay particular attention to: E and F I, J and L M, N and W U and V I and T(It is often hard to tell the difference between these letters when candidates write them quickly.)Numbers: Numbers can be even more difficult to read:Many candidates do not realise that their numbers cannot be recognised by the examiners. Practise so that your numbers look similar to those shown above.  

choose a realistic and achievable goal.  follow a regular study plan.  increase your personal speed.  increase your sentence-reading speed.  develop a memory for english.  manage your time carefully: the listening sub-test.  the golden rule of ielts: the golden rule is "always give the monkey exactly what he wants".  read the instructions carefully: candidates who do not read or listen to the instructions carefully may believe they are saving time,but the instructions contain vital information which must be understood in order to answer correctly.  always look at the example:the example is given to you for a number of very good reasons.  use question keywords to find the answer: the keywords or key phrases in the questions help you in your search for the answers.  check before the end of the test.  ,  do not forget to make logical guesses: in the reading sub-test, if you are having trouble completing the questions to a particular passage,you should leave a minute or so at the end of each advised time period for that passage (usually 20 minutes) to guess those questions that can be guessed.  are your answers grammatically correct?,  give one answer only: give just one answer to a question, unless you are specifically requested to give more than one answer.  check your spelling: in the listening and reading tests exact spelling is not always essential.  make sure your answers are easy to read: you cannot expect to do well if your answers cannot be read. 

 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, also called NSAIDs, are common pain relievers used to treat juvenile arthritis. If the pain from the arthritis is mild, these pain relievers may be the only treatment needed. Many NSAIDs can be purchased over-the-counter, including ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve).NSAIDs can help reduce the severity of pain and swelling. Your doctor may prescribe stronger NSAIDs if the over-the-counter ones do not help. Younger children may be given liquid doses. Side effects include gastrointestinal problems like upset stomachs.; , Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are prescribed when NSAIDs don’t work in the treatment of juvenile arthritis. DMARDs slow joint damage and the progression of the arthritis by targeting the immune system. A doctor may prescribe DMARDs along with NSAIDs to help reduce swelling and pain.Examples of DMARDs are methotrexate, leflunamide, infliximab, anakinra, cyclosporine, sulfasalazine, and tocilizumab. DMARDs may cause negative side effects. You should discuss the side effects with the doctor and monitor the child while they take the medication.  Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers can help if other medications can’t. These medications help relieve pain, reduce swollen joints, and lessen morning stiffness.These drugs can have significant side effects. For example, there may be an increased risk of infections and an increased risk of cancers like lymphoma. Examples of TNF blockers include etanercept (Enbrel) and adalimumbab (Humira).  In some cases, steroids can be used to treat juvenile arthritis. Corticosteroids can be given by mouth or injected. This can be used if a single joint is affected. This treatment can only be given for a limited amount of time at low doses.Steroids used for long periods of time on children can lead to weight gain, growth problems, bone problems, cataracts, hypertension, and increased risk of infection.  

take nsaids.  try disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.  use tumor necrosis factor blockers.  get an injection of steroids. 

 These are listed below under "Things You'll Need". ,   Gently spread out lengthened shapes to represent the ears at the top end. These are fairly long and slightly pointed, as shown. At the other end of the oval, gently spread out two pieces to form the legs. These aren't as long as the ears, nor are they pointed, so keep them rounded at the tips. For the little arms, press up two pimple shapes about a quarter way down from the top of the Pikachu (chest area). , Use a popsicle stick or a clay tool to mark claws onto the feet and arms of the model. Aim to make small indentations that will later be highlighted by paint.   Make a sausage-like roll shape from the clay that will be shaped into the tail.       Shape the tail. Flatten evenly and then cut it zigzag style, like a stylized lightning bolt shape. Be sure to leave plenty of clay at one end that isn't shaped, for attaching to the backside of the Pikachu model. Once made, attach to the clay model and smooth into place; adjust if needed to ensure that the tail is sticking out properly.  Place in an oven or let clay dry out at room temperature. Follow the manufacturer's instructions on the clay packaging for temperatures or air-drying times.  Once cooled, paint the entire model in yellow. Allow to dry before proceeding to the next step.    Paint or mark in black eyes, claws and tips on the end of ears.  Make two red dots on his cheeks. Allow the front paintwork to dry before proceeding to the next step.  Paint or draw on three brown lines on the model's back. Allow the paint to dry.  You could also give it as a gift.   If playing with the model, be gentle with it, as the clay will be easily chipped or broken.  

assemble the items needed to make this project.  make a small oval shape from the clay.  ,  start shaping the defining body features.  shape the arms into definite three dimensional forms, coming right out from the body.  ,  add claw details into the clay.  create pikachu's tail.  bake the clay.  once baked, allow pikachu to cool down.  add in the details to give pikachu distinctiveness.  create the cheek detail.  turn the model over.  display the dried model as wished.

 There is not a lot of leeway in when you might be able to schedule an appointment for a readjustment of your braces. But if you can, plan for a day when you do not have major deadlines or other activities that demand concentration and focus. Try to schedule an appointment towards the end of the day so you can go home immediately after the appointment and rest.  Your mouth will be sensitive again for a couple of days after you get your braces readjusted and/or tightened. You should plan to eat soft foods like mashed potatoes, pudding, soups and similar foods for a couple of days  , Take an acetaminophen tablet before your appointment so that it will go into effect when during your appointment. This way, the pain and discomfort will be lessened immediately. Take another pain reliever 4-6 hours after the first one to continue to manage your pain!  , Now is the time to tell your orthodontist if you are having any issues with your braces or if you are noticing problems such as headaches or mouth sores that are not healing. There may be other adjustments that can be made to help alleviate or address these problems.  

get your timing right.  stock up on soft foods.  take a pain reliever before the appointment.  talk with your orthodontist about your concerns. 

 In the Victorian era, pale people were considered beautiful.  These create the illusion that you are pale.  Dark colors like jet black, black-brown, or dark brown are very essential to this look. If you can't it is okay, you just need to emphasize the rest of the look. However, it was more fashionable at the time to have lighter coloured hair. , Victorian ladies were always paying attention.  During Victorian times it was considered very vulgar to 'paint' (as wearing makeup was called). It was usually a mark of a woman of ill repute.  

look as pale as possible.  use either a very light pink or very dark red lipstick.  if dying your hair is an option, do it.  do your hair up, but try to hide the pins or elastic.  ,  keep your eyes wide open.  avoid makeup as much as possible or make it as natural as possible. 

 While barks alone can tell you a lot, looking at body language in combination with barks can tell you a lot more. If you are able to, look at your dog's body while it barks in order to make a better assessment.For example, a dog that is barking repeatedly and loudly may be excited or it may be guarding against someone or something. However, if you see that the dog is in a defensive stance and showing its teeth as well, then you know that it is guarding.  If your dog is barking you should try to figure out what it is trying to communicate to you. If you understand the conditions that are prompting a specific bark, then you may be able to switch that around next time the dog does that bark and understand that it signals that condition.   For example, it may be telling you that someone is at the front door. If you can identify the specific bark your dog does when someone comes to the door, then the next time your dog does that bark you will know that someone is at your door.  Barks can be very connected to what your dog wants or expects at certain times of day. If you know that your dog is barking for a specific reason, take the time to identify exactly how that bark sounds to that you can identify it in different circumstances.For example, if your dog needs to be let out to go to the bathroom every morning, pay attention to what that bark sounds like so that you can identify that same bark later.  

watch how your dog moves while it barks.  look for conditions that might be influencing your dog's barks.  take note of barks that signal specific bodily needs. 

 You may think everyone is talking about you, that everyone hates your new haircut, or that your new boss is out to get you. However, it's highly possible that none of this is true. The next time you have a very pessimistic thought, stop and do the following:   Ask yourself how likely it is that the pessimistic thought you're having will come true. When you're expecting the worst, consider all of the possible outcomes of a situation, not just the most negative ones. Then, you'll see that there are many possibilities in virtually every situation. Try to combat each pessimistic thought you have with two realistic thoughts. For example, if you're worried that everyone is laughing about your shoes, consider that 1) it's unlikely that a pair of shoes will keep everyone laughing throughout the day, and 2) it's more likely that a new, hilarious cat meme is making its way around the office messaging system.; , Part of being paranoid means not just considering that everyone is against you or out to get you, but it also means thinking about this constantly. The more you think about the same negative thing, the more you indulge in your paranoid thoughts, and the more you become convinced that they are likely to be accurate. Though it's impossible to stop obsessing completely, there are a few tricks that can help you minimize your obsessive thoughts:   Give yourself a designated "worry time." Spend this time sitting down with your paranoid thoughts, evaluating them, and trying to minimize them. If a worry comes up during a different part of the day, just try to mentally move it to your "worry time."Keep a journal that tracks your paranoid thoughts. Reread it weekly. This can help you not only unload some of your paranoid feelings in a more healthy fashion, but it can also help you see that some of your paranoid fears were completely unfounded when you read back over what you've written. You may see that you worried about X happening on a certain date. Once the date passes, and X didn't happen, you may be able to accept that many of your paranoid beliefs are unwarranted., Having someone you can talk to about your paranoid feelings can help you get your worries out in the open and get a different perspective. Even the act of vocalizing some of your fears can help you see how they may be illogical. If you tell your friend that you think your group of friends really hates you, your friend will be able to provide rational and concrete examples that prove you wrong. Just make sure you pick one of your more rational and even-keeled friends. You don't want someone who might encourage your paranoid behavior and make you feel worse.  Though staying busy can't help you escape your problems, it can help you focus your energies on more productive outlets, such as pursuing your interests or attaining your personal goals.   If you spend even a few hours a week pursuing something that you really love, whether it's yoga or coin collecting, you're guaranteed to be less absorbed in your paranoid thoughts.  This exercise really helps. If you put yourself in the shoes of the people you're so worried about, it'll help you see that many of your fears are unfounded. For a simple example, let's say you head to a party and tell yourself, "Everyone will probably notice that I'm wearing the same outfit that I wore to that party three weeks ago." Ask yourself if you remember what anyone else was wearing at that other party; the chances that you remember what anyone was wearing are very slim.   Ask yourself what the chances are that all of the people you're worried about are thinking about you as much as you're worried about them thinking about you. Do you spend hours thinking about how much you don't like those other people? Probably not.  If you have anxiety, then you may be plagued by worry and a constant fear that something may go wrong. Anxiety may even trigger your paranoid thoughts, though these two conditions are different. Anxiety may cause you to worry that you're suffering from a fatal illness; on the contrary, paranoia may lead you to believe that your doctor purposefully made you sick.If anxiety is in fact the main cause of your problems, then you may want to seek medical help or take actions to stop anxiety., There's a difference between occasionally worrying that all of your friends are talking about you and letting this thought completely consume you. There's also a difference between knowing that your thoughts are irrational on some level and suffering from serious delusions that everyone is really out to hurt you. If you feel like your paranoid feelings are taking over your life and preventing you from enjoying your everyday interactions or socializing, then talk to a psychologist or other mental health professional to get help for your condition., Of course, this is easier said than done, but once you start believing in yourself and get comfortable around others, you'll see that every little thing you do, say, or wear doesn't really matter to anyone around you.   Work on being less self-conscious. Self-conscious people worry about the subjective experiences of others, which is something no one really has control over.Recognize that no matter what someone thinks of you, they have the power to think it. Sometimes, other people make comments about us that reflect what we think of ourselves. Even in these situations, it doesn't make the opinion a fact. Aim to shrug off these comments and stop questioning yourself every time someone states a subjective opinion of you. Work on accepting yourself unconditionally.No matter if you did just trip over a rug or if your hair is sticking up, you're still human. All human beings are flawed creatures. Embrace your natural quirks and quit thinking everyone else is perfect except for you. Need a reality check? Visit YouTube and watch a few klutzy videos to remind yourself that all humans make mistakes - and sometimes these mistakes are laughable.  Many paranoid people are so afraid that no one likes them or wants to hang out with them that they're more likely to spend time alone or at home instead of in a social setting. If you never put yourself out there, then you'll only expect the worst because you won't ever experience the positive aspects of social interaction. Make a goal of getting out of the house and hanging out with people fairly often, or at least once or twice a week.The more time you spend socializing, the more comfortable you'll be with the people around you and the less likely you'll be to imagine that they all hate you.  After hanging out with a group of friends or even just talking to a neighbor on your street or chatting with the check-out girl at your local grocery store, you should come away with at least a few positive impressions of your fellow citizens of the world. At the end of every day or week, write down all of the good things that happened when you interacted with other people, all of the positive ways they made you feel, and all of the reasons why these interactions benefited your life.When you're feeling paranoid, review this list. Reminding yourself of all the concrete reasons why you should have more faith in others' intentions can help you ease your paranoid thoughts.  You may think that a person hates you when he's just giving you constructive criticism and telling you how to improve. If your teacher gives you a poor grade on an essay, read the feedback and try to see if she has a valid point instead of assuming that you got the bad grade because your teacher just doesn't like you.   If you've been given some hurtful criticism, remember that it is entirely up to you how to receive it. You can cry or dwell on it for weeks, or you can think of it as an opportunity to refine yourself. Write down the critical comment and ponder its validity. If there is even the slightest chance that the critical remark is warranted, then you need to think hard about whether this is an aspect of yourself you want to change, or whether you are willing to stay the same.  Unfortunately, not everyone you meet or interact with is going to like you or be nice to you. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't put yourself out there! In fact, being aware of the fact that there are mean, careless, or bitter people out in the world will make you appreciate all of the good people in your life even more. If someone is just outright rude to you for no reason, then you need to learn to accept that this is a result of that person's insecurities and personal issues, and not because of something you did.   Remind yourself that it takes all kinds of people to make the world. Not everyone is going to be your best friend, but that also doesn't mean everyone wants to be your worst enemy.  If you're worried that your current partner is cheating on you - especially if you've had this concern about every person you've dated - then, chances are, your worries are rooted in paranoia. Ask yourself if you have any concrete evidence that this may be happening or if all of your concerns are in your head.Be open and talk to your partner about it. Tell him or her that you know your feelings are irrational and that you want help dealing with them. Don't accuse your partner of cheating or check in every two seconds when you're not together to make sure he or she is not cheating. This will only make your partner feel like there's a lack of trust in the relationship. Maintain your own identity. If you get too obsessed with the person you're dating or start depending on him or her too much, then you'll be even more likely to be paranoid because you'll feel completely dependent on that person's loyalty. Maintain other relationships outside of a romantic one.  Ask yourself what you and your group of friends talk about when one of you isn't around - do you spend all of your time gossiping and talking about how much you hate that person? Unless you're in a really gossipy or mean group of friends, then most likely not. Ask yourself how likely it is that people talk about you the second you leave.   Do your friends invite you to hang out? Send you text messages? Compliment you? Ask you for advice? If so, then why would you think that they completely hate you?  , If this is you, then ask yourself about what evidence you actually have that you're going to lose your job. Do you get to work on time? Put in your hours? Show improvement? If so, then why would you get fired? If you've had no warning signs and people around you aren't getting fired left and right, then it's very likely that your worries are all in your head.   Help yourself feel better by making a list of all the great contributions you've made in the workplace. Make a list of all of the compliments or positive feedback that your boss has given you. Now, write down anything negative you were told. You'll see that the positive far outweighs the negative, and, if they don't make an action plan to shift your work efforts in a positive direction.  Another form of paranoia is ego-driven.You may think that as soon as you step into the halls or into a party, that everyone is staring at you, laughing at you, or making fun of you behind your back. Ask yourself how often you stare at a random person who arrived on the scene; chances are, like most people, you are too concerned with how you look and how others perceive you to pay all that much attention to anyone else.  

overcome pessimism.one of the reasons you may be paranoid is that you tend to assume the worst in any situation instead of being realistic about possible outcomes.  stop obsessing over every little thing.  confide in a close friend.  stay busy.another way to avoid being paranoid is to not give yourself a lot of time to wallow or sit around thinking about what everyone else is thinking about you.  put yourself in someone else's shoes.  see if your paranoia is rooted in anxiety.  seek professional help if it's necessary.  stop caring what other people think.if you want to be able to socialize without constantly worrying about how others perceive you, then you have to slowly learn to stop caring about what people think.  put yourself out there.  take note of all the kindness around you.  learn to accept criticism.  accept that there are mean people in the world.  confront your partner if you think he or she is cheating on you.  question whether your friends are really talking about you.  combat paranoia on the job.a common paranoid worry that people tend to have at work is that they're always on the brink of being fired or that their boss hates him or her.  remember that not everyone is looking at you when you step out.

 The twelve bar blues are a chord progression -- a set structure of movement to build a blues song. Thus learning the form in one place completely makes it easy to transpose to any key. For example, you could memorize the chords in the key of E, then worry about getting other keys later on. For this tutorial, stick to E. The standard blues progression has only three chords -- the I, the IV, and the V, where the starting cord (the I) is an E. The fourth chord (IV) is an A, and the five chord (V) is a B.          If the Roman numerals are confusing you can just ignore them. They correspond to the number of the note in the major scale -- the first, fourth, and fifth note. The fourth note of the E-major scale is an A, the fifth a B. Make sure you know at least the major scale and the minor penatonic scale before continuing.; , The twelve bar blues is simply a set chord pattern played in 4/4 time, which is the most common time signature in music -- turn on any radio song and count "1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1..." if you need help getting a feel for it. One bar is this count from 1-4, so the twelve bar blues is a progression of 12 of these counts.          Metronomes are essential practice tools, as they help you time up your transitions where they should be and get used to the twelve bars, exactly. Bars are also called "measures." A good practice speed for beginners is 60 BPM or so.  For example, keeping the blues in E, you would start with four bars of an E. Simply strum it, keeping count, for four bars.          For a bigger, more bluesy sound you can play 7th chords, like an E7. For now, however, just focus on the progression.  Slide off your E and head to the A, which is the fourth chord in the key of E. Then return to the E for two more bars.  You hit the V chord, here a B, once after the first eight bars are done. This is the beginning of the "turnaround," or the end of the twelve bars.  The ending a twelve bar blues is called the turnaround. You run quickly through every chord, hit the V one last time, and then start over. In the case of E major, you want to play one measure of B, A, E, and then a final B.  Once you get through all twelve bars you're back at the beginning. Just keep repeating the same pattern to keep your song rolling. This is the twelve bar blues in E. As long as you can figure out the intervals between the I, IV, and V using the major scale (remember, the 4th note of the scale is the IV chord), you can now play the blues in every key.          For example, in the key of A you would play A(I), D(IV), E(V).  Most songs in 4/4 are "straight." This means that on every count (1, 2, 3, 4) you strum the guitar once. But the blues has a shuffle rhythm, or a swing step, that uses a quickly alternated up-down strumming pattern. Think of playing with the rhythm, "1 and, 2 and, 3 and, 4 and, 1 and..." You strum down on the "one" with a long stroke, then a quick upstroke on the "and." The final rhythm has a long-short, shuffling feel to it.          Listen to some old B.B. Kind or Muddy Waters, to hear the shuffle-strum in action. Not how it keeps the song moving forward, even on slower, sadder songs.  If you want to play something a little more unique than straight chords you can pick up a riff that follows the chord progression. To keep the classic twelve-bar melody alive, you want to start each bar on the appropriate chord. If the chord is the I chord, here an E, you want the first note played in the measure to be an E. From here you can then improvise or play around to get new sounds on the 12-bar blues.          The following riff will continue in the key of E, and is a good example of how to add new notes and riffs to the basic blues. That said, feel free to take these licks and improvise on them to make them unique.  You're going to kick things off exactly how you started the basic pattern. Turn the metronome on, and use the shuffle rhythm to count out a "1 and," on the E chord.  Simply stretch your ring finger down two frets and do the exact same pattern for "2 and." You want to keep your index finger down, so that whenever you pick the A up you're right back to your original E power chord. Putting it all together, you should end up with half a bar of alternating notes.  You'll play each note twice in each bar. If you were counting it out, it would sound like: "E and, A and, E and, A and..." Complete this for four bars.          This is exactly the same amount of time you'd play the I chord, or the E, in a normal twelve-bar chord progression.  Again, you want to change chords at the exact time as the original twelve-bar progression learned above. Use your index finger to create the A power chord just like you created the E.  Land your ring finger two frets down to the D. Play the quick up and down rhythm for "2 and," then release the ring finger back to the A on your index finger. Play this for another four bars.  Again, this is just like the original progression, which went E-E-E-E-A-A-E-E-B-A-E-B.  After your two bars of E, it's time to hit the V chord again, here a B. To get to a basic B power chord, simply add your ring finger two frets down, one string over. Like the rest of the measures, you'll strum this for a quick "1 and" before modifying it.          Use your second finger, when possible, to get to the 4th fret -- it will make the next step much easier.  For E and A, you had to stretch two frets down with a second finger. But, since you're already using two fingers for the B, you need to stretch your pinky way down to the sixth fret to get the same alternating effect as the other two chords.  Instead of hitting the next A chord, hit the A-D alternating chord. Then the pattern you started with for the E, followed by the A and a last run at the B. Basically you are using this riff in the place of the actual chords, simply using the first note (which always matches the twelve bar blues) to imply the basic structure and melody.  Palm muting is placing the fatty part of your strumming hand lightly on the strings at the bottom of the guitar, making them sound dull and percussive. The minor pentatonic scale, often known as the blues scale, is a collection of notes perfect for any blues song, and you can add them in the last half of each bar for some blazing licks. And, while the shuffle rhythm is classic blues, the turnaround often features harder, more dramatic strumming, or even softer, lighter strums, depending on the mood. Either way, it is a good place to change things up.         

focus on learning the progression in one key to get used to the sound and movement.  set a metronome to 4/4 time, at a speed you can comfortably play along with.  play the i chord for four bars to kick off the progression.  play the iv chord for two bars, then return to the i chord for two bars.  play one bar of the v chord.  play one bar of the iv, the i, and the v again to get back to the beginning.  return to four bars of the i chord and repeat.  use the "shuffle" or swing feel when strumming.  play the root note of each chord at the beginning of the measure to keep the progression alive.  start with two quick strums of the e power chord.  place your ring finger two frets down, on the a, and strum two more quick strums.  keep alternating the e and a for four full bars.  drop down one string to the a-chord after four bars.  again, place your ring finger two frets down and alternate every beat for two measures.  return to the e power chord pattern for two bars.  add your ring finger one string down and two frets over to go from the e to a b.  use your pinky to stretch all the way to the sixth fret on the g string.  use this alternating, two-note pattern through all three measures of the turnaround.  add in some palm muting, the pentatonic scale, and mixed up rhythms for the second half of each bar for a unique riffing and solo style. 

 Before boarding any boat (big or small) try to avoid consuming things that are likely to make your seasickness and nausea worse, such as alcohol, caffeine, fatty foods and spicy foods.Heavy, greasy meals contribute to the development of nausea, which will be worsened by the motion on the water. That being said, it's important not to travel/sail on an empty stomach either. Focus on drinking lots of purified water and eating small portions of low-fat, high-protein foods such as grilled turkey or chicken breast, lean fish, cottage cheese, or legumes.   Sea sickness most commonly affects young children, pregnant women, and migraine sufferers.; , When booking travel on a cruise ship or boarding any other decent sized boat, try to get a berth or seat as close to the center point of the vessel as possible, because that area will experience the least amount of motion.Also try to get as close to the water as possible because the further away you get from the surface (the top decks of cruise ships, for example), the more motion you'll experience. In addition, try to seat yourself facing the direction of travel because you'll feel better orientated.   Seasickness symptoms arise due to conflicting sensory information between the inner ear, eyes, and brain.In essence, your brain thinks it's moving more than it actually is. Sailing on large cruise ships doesn't pose as many problems for people because of their relative lack of bobbing motion and use of automated stabilizers. To acclimate yourself aboard a cruise ship it's best to spend some time out on a lower deck, using the horizon as a point to maintain your equilibrium. Having a window to look out will also give you a view of the horizon point.  Just like reading while riding in a car, reading on a boat can increase your risk of getting sea sick.The problem is that your eyes are focused on the words in the book, which aren't moving, but your vestibular senses in your inner ears are picking up on all the movements caused by the boat — this conflicting information for the brain leads to feelings of disorientation, mild dizziness and nausea. As such, don't read books or magazines while on a boat if you're sensitive to seasickness. Instead, keep your gaze fixed on the horizon or on a fixed point until your inner ears and brain better synchronize with each other in terms of movement.   If you're very sensitive to seasickness but enjoy cruising, then book only port-intensive cruises with lots of stops and fewer days on the rougher open seas. Consider reading prior to getting on a boat because it can make you drowsy and more prone to sleep. Sleeping on a boat, if that's appropriate, can negate the effects of seasickness.  A particularly interesting approach to negating the nausea and dizziness associated with repetitive motion is acupressure, particularly of the "P6 point" near the wrist.Acupressure is an ancient Chinese art of healing that stimulates various points around the body to reduce symptoms and encourage healing. The P6 point is about one inch above the crease of your wrist and associated with controlling or reducing nausea. Specially designed wrist bands are available for this purpose and sold online or at travel stores. Anecdotal reports suggest they are quite effective for all types of motion sickness.   A new FDA-approved device for motion sickness, called the ReliefBand, uses weak electrical current to stimulate the P6 point. Alternatively, consider simply stimulating the P6 point with your thumb when you begin to feel nauseous and see how it works. Clinical trials have yielded mixed results concerning the value of acupressure in general, so your results may differ significantly from others.  An old home remedy for the prevention of nausea involves taking the spice known as ginger. Ginger spice is made from the underground rhizome (similar to root) of the ginger plant — it has a pungent and zesty flavor. Ginger has a long history of being very effective in alleviating many types of gastrointestinal symptoms. Studies looking at sea sickness in naval cadets found that consuming ginger (before boarding) significantly reduces the symptoms of motion sickness, such as dizziness, nausea and vomiting.Medicinally, ginger is most commonly taken as a capsule (dried), but eating it fresh or pickled works also. You can also eat ginger chews or candies. Take between one to two grams of ginger at least 30 minutes before boarding a boat in order to avoid or minimize nausea. Numerous studies have confirmed that ginger is particularly effective in relieving nausea and vomiting during pregnancy., Drugs called antihistamines are the most frequently used and widely available medications for the symptoms of motion sickness.Antihistamines work by influencing the part of the brain that controls nausea and vomiting.The most common ones used for sea sickness include dimenhydrinate (Dramamine), cyclizine (Marezine), diphenhydramine (Benadryl), promethazine (Phenergan) and meclizine (Antivert).   Non-sedating antihistamines appear to be less effective, and besides, you may actually want to sleep your time away while on a boat. Promethazine causes the most sleepiness, whereas meclizine (also used to treat vertigo) is less sedating and can be taken as a single daily dose.Medications are most effective when taken prior to boarding a boat and less effective for symptom relief after the sea sickness has begun.  Anticholinergics are another class of drugs commonly used to combat motion sickness and they work by slowing down the messages related to the involuntary nervous system that go back and forth between the brain, inner ears, and eyes.Scopolamine (Transderm-Scop) is the most well-known anticholinergic and is available as a skin patch meant to be applied behind your ear at least eight hours before boarding a boat. It's effectiveness for nausea prevention can last for up to three days.   Common side effects of scopolamine are the same as those of antihistamines (drowsiness, blurred vision, dry mouth, and confusion). Scopolamine also has the ability to cause hallucinations and wipe out short-term memory, so extreme caution should be used with this drug. Pills tend to produce more side effects than the transdermal patch, but never use more than one patch at a time. Other prescription medications sometimes used to manage sea sickness include: antidopaminergics (promethazine and metoclopramide), amphetamines, and benzodiazepines (Xanax and Valium).  Some prescription drugs commonly cause nausea in sensitive users, so it's important to realize if yours are on that list. If they are and you're planning on a cruise or just going boating for the day, ask your doctor if you can discontinue or reduce the dose over the short-term. For example, some antidepressants, oral contraceptives, antibiotics (erythromycin), anti-parasitics and narcotics (codeine) are known to worsen the nausea of sea sickness.However, never change doses of prescription medication without your doctor's approval.   If you are taking prescription medications, avoid mixing them with alcohol, particularly while on a boat. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, can also worsen the effects of motion sickness.  

be careful what you eat and drink before going on a boat.  choose a seat associated with the least motion.  don't read while on a boat.  wear a specially designed wrist band.  consider taking some ginger.  try over-the-counter antihistamines.  ask your doctor about prescription anticholinergics.  ask your doctor what drugs may cause or worsen nausea. 

 If you are sleep deprived, you may feel tired all the time. You may yawn often during the day and find it hard to stay awake when you are doing tasks. You may feel groggy in the morning or throughout the day.You may find yourself dozing off at random times, especially during meetings, while watching television, or even when driving.  Another symptom of sleep deprivation is a lack of mental alertness. This means you may have trouble concentrating, you may not think as clearly, your memory may be weaker than usual, or you may have decreased reaction time.Many accidents occur due to lack of mental alertness due to sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation can cause all of your thought processes to work slower and not as efficiently as when you are fully rested.  Sleep deprivation can lead to a lowered immune system. This can cause you to get sick more often because your body is unable to fight off bacteria, viruses, and other diseases. Sleep deprivation can also cause you to get better more slowly that if you were rested.If you have been getting sick often, or if you are unable to kick a cold or other condition, you may be sleep deprived.  

decide if you are always tired.  determine if you are mentally alert.  figure out if you are getting sick more often. 

 As well as making improvements to your general lifestyle and cutting back on your commitments to secure some time for yourself, you can try some specific relaxation techniques to help you unwind. Meditation is an ancient practice that is aimed at calming your mind and helping you become at peace with yourself. Try just sitting quietly while being aware of your breathing.   As thoughts pop into you head, try to return your mind’s focus to your steady breathing. Alternatively, focus on an object you have placed in front of you, or you could try to visualise something calming, like a gentle sea.You might find it hard at first but you will improve the more you practice meditation.  If you find it hard to stick with the meditation you could practice some relaxed deep breathing. Sit in a comfortable chair which supports your head, or lie down flat with your palms up and your legs a little apart. Fill up your lungs without forcing them, breathing in through your nose. Count to five as you breathe in.   Breathe out through your mouth, slowly counting to five again. Repeat this with a regular and controlled rhythm. Breathe without pausing or holding your breathe, and keep doing this until you feel calm and relaxed. Try to do this for three to five minutes, two or three times daily., If you have some more time then you can try practicing a deep muscle relaxation session. This will take around twenty minutes and it stretches and relaxes different muscles which releases tension from your body and mind. Once you have a warm and quiet place, sit or lie down and concentrate on steady breathing. Going through each in turn you will release the tension from your face, neck, shoulders, chest, arms, legs, wrists and hands. Repeat each exercise a couple of times before moving on.   Begin by pushing together your eyebrows, as if you were frowning, hold for a few seconds and then release. Next move onto the neck by gently tilting the head forward, with your chin down towards your chest, holding for a few seconds, before lifting your head back up. Pull your shoulders up towards your ears, hold there, then relax them. For your chest, breathe slowly and deeply into your diaphragm then breathe out slowly. Allow your belly to deflate as the air is exhaled. Then stretch your arms away from your body, reaching forward and holding, before relaxing. With your legs stretched out, push your toes away from your body, pull them back towards your body, and then relax. Finally stretch your wrists by pulling your hand up towards you, stretching the fingers and thumbs and holding before relaxing. 

try out some meditation.  do some relaxed deep breathing.  attempt deep muscle relaxation. 

 Red, inflamed skin is the most obvious and common symptom of psoriasis. These patches may appear anywhere on the body and vary in size and shape. The red color can vary from a brighter red to a dull pinkish-white., The red patches caused by psoriasis are often covered by a rougher whitish or grayish layer of skin not unlike a scab. This second layer of raised skin is often referred to as a “silvery sheen” or “silvery scales.” This rough, scaly skin might flake off when rubbed or touched.If your psoriasis is on the scalp, this white, dead layer of skin might appear similar to dandruff.  If you have psoriasis, you might have vertically-oriented striping or discoloration of the nails. You’ll probably also experience pitting of the nails – small holes or indentations in the surface of the normally smooth nail. The nails could become thick and rough. In extreme cases, your nail might become detached from the nail bed.These nail deformities could occur with your fingernails or toenails.  As you might imagine, cracked, rough, scaly skin is also incredibly irritating. If your skin feels itchy and irritated as well as raised and inflamed, you almost definitely have psoriasis; however, no matter how irritated it is, do not pick or scrape your skin. This will only cause bleeding and further irritation. 

look for patches of red skin.  look for a silvery sheen.  check for deformities of the nails.  monitor for irritation. 

 In general, you will want a boot stretcher to stretch the foot of the boot and a calf stretcher to stretch the calf portion of the boot.   The difference between a boot stretcher and a shoe stretcher is that a boot stretcher has a long handle sticking up, allowing you to access the stretching mechanism in spite of the boot's tall sides. If your leather boots are ankle height, you can probably manage to stretch the foot with a shoe stretcher instead of a boot stretcher.  Carefully position the wooden wedge of the boot stretcher device into the foot of the boot.   Make sure that the long handle sticks up and out of the boot. You will need to be able to reach the handle and turn it without difficulty.  Turn the handle to open the wedge up. The screw device should push open the wedge, stretching out the toe area in the process.   Let the leather sit in this position for several minutes before returning the wedge to its original size and removing it from the boot.  Pull the boot over the calf stretcher so that the entire calf portion fits on.   Stop directly above the ankle of the boot to avoid damaging or distorting the foot of the boot.  Turn the crank at the top of the device to open up the wedge. Open the wedge as far as it will go to stretch the boots as much as possible.   Let the boots sit on the calf stretcher for several minutes to maximize the effect.  

choose the right footwear stretcher for you.  wedge a boot stretcher into the foot of the boot.  open the wedge once inside the boot.  slip the boot onto a calf stretcher to stretch the calf portion.  crank open the wedge. 

 Wooden star cut-outs are likely to be found in craft stores and home décor stores. Choose one that is a good size for fitting your name inside of it.; , You could paint it other colors, but these are more fitting colors for a Hollywood theme. Allow to dry, then paint another layer or two. Allow to dry before proceeding.   If you paint the star light red, consider painting a gold border all the way around the edges of the star.  If it helps you to keep neat, use stencil letters or cut out cardboard templates from printed letters and attach these, then trace around them.  Take care not to go over any lines; use a fine paintbrush for the edges. Allow to dry before proceeding.   If preferred, use a Sharpie marker to color in the letters.  This step is optional but can add some pizazz to the design. Either use glitter glue or spread glue on the star where you'd like the glitter to go, then sprinkle on the glitter. Allow to dry before hanging.  Simply brush over the whole design and allow to dry.   Be sure to follow any other instructions indicated by the packaging of the sealant chosen.  Thread a cord, wire or filament piece through this and tie in a strong knot, to form a hanging loop.  Depending on its size, either add a hook to the door for hanging from, or just hang it from the doorknob.  

purchase a wooden star.  paint the star yellow, gold or light red.  draw the letters of your first name onto the painted surface.  paint the letters in black.  decorate with glitter for a fun touch.  for a longer-enduring nameplate, consider sealing it with mod podge or a varnish.  drill a hole at the top of the star.  hang the hollywood star nameplate on your door. 

 You were your own unique and perfectly content person long before this guy’s opinion ever meant a thing to you; the more you remember and act on that, the stronger and more attractive you’ll feel. In fact, it may help to think back on all the other ways that this guy demonstrated his poor judgment. Are his actions idiotic? Was he a Geologist? Did he always wear socks with sandals? Maybe the signs were there all along…; , Not only will you be doing yourself a favor by emotionally disengaging, but, since nothing is more unpleasant than unwelcome attention, you might be able to recover a few shards of a friendship with him. If you simply cannot function around him, or you think you would start to like him more once near, find (inconspicuous) ways to avoid him until you feel more centered.  He could’ve pretended to like you in order to manipulate you more. Then where’d you be? You might feel heartbroken now, but at least be relieved that he didn’t actively deceive you, leading to more intense heartbreak.  Maybe he exploited your feelings for him and advised others to do the same. Maybe he constantly interrupted you and dreamed of being a pet taxidermist. Maybe you were in love with the fantasy of this guy and not the guy himself. Dredging all the ugly details will help you realize that, just maybe, he’s doing you a big favor by being such a jerk. That way, you didn’t realize these flaws until you were at the altar.  Following step 2 and becoming a full-time hermit is just going to make you feel like he’s the only person in the world. Go out with your pals, have a girls’ night, and socialize as much as possible. The more you meet your emotional needs elsewhere, the more you won’t pay that lost cause any attention.  

realize that just because he doesn't like you doesn't mean you're unlikable.  back off for a bit, don’t interact with him just for the sake of being around him.  be glad he didn’t lead you on.  think about all the things you didn't like about him.  spend more time with your friends. 

 We make a lot of assumptions about almost everything. It's how our brain processes certain pieces of information, and how we get along in everyday life. You could say they are the foundation of our critical framework. But what if those assumptions turned out to be wrong, or at least not entirely truthful? Then the whole foundation needs to be re-built, from the bottom up.   What does it mean to question assumptions? Einstein questioned the assumption that Newtonian laws of motion could accurately describe the world.He developed an entirely new framework for looking at the world by redescribing what he thought had happened, starting from scratch. We can question assumptions in a similar way. Why do we feel the need to eat in the morning, even when we're not hungry? Why do we assume that we'll fail when we haven't even tried? What other assumptions are we taking for granted that might crumble upon further examination?; , Like assumptions, taking information on authority can be useful. Instead of double-checking everything anyone says, we tend to label information as either coming from a trustworthy or not trustworthy source. This keeps us from double-checking every piece of information that comes our way, saving time and energy. But it also keeps us from getting to the bottom of things we perceive as coming from a trustworthy source, even when they don't. Just because it was published in a magazine or broadcast over TV doesn't mean it's necessarily true.   Get in the habit of using your instinct to investigate questionable pieces of information. If your gut isn't satisfied with an explanation, ask the person to elaborate. If you don't question a fact, read about it or test it yourself. Soon enough, you'll build up a pretty good sense of what deserves more research and what you've determined to be true in your own judgment.  You've already read about questioning assumptions and questioning authority figures. Now you're about to be told to question...everything? Asking questions is perhaps the quintessential act of critical thinking. If you don't know what questions to ask, or don't ask the questions in the first place, you may as well not get the answer. Finding the answer, and finding it elegantly, is what critical thinking is all about.   How does ball lightning work? How do fish fall from the sky in the middle of Australia?How can we take meaningful steps to fight global poverty? How do we dismantle production of nuclear weapons worldwide?  

question your assumptions.  don't take information on authority until you've investigated it yourself.  question things. 

 Write out the original matrix M, draw a vertical line to the right of it, and then write the identity matrix to the right of that. You should now have what appears to be a matrix with three rows of six columns each.Recall that the identity matrix is a special matrix with 1s in each position of the main diagonal from upper left to lower right, and 0s in all other positions. For a review of the identity matrix and its properties, see Understand the Basics of Matrices.  Your objective is to create the identity matrix on the left side of this newly augmented matrix. As you perform row reduction steps on the left, you must consistently perform the same operations on the right, which began as your identity matrix.Remember that row reductions are performed as a combination of scalar multiplication and row addition or subtraction, in order to isolate individual terms of the matrix. For a more complete review, see Row-Reduce Matrices.  Keep repeating linear row reduction operations until the left side of your augmented matrix displays the identity matrix (diagonal of 1s, with other terms 0). When you have reached this point, the right side of your vertical divider will be the inverse of your original matrix., Copy the elements now appearing on the right side of the vertical divider as the inverse matrix. 

adjoin the identity matrix to the original matrix.  perform linear row reduction operations.  continue until you form the identity matrix.  write out the inverse matrix. 

 To get in Hugel, take the Izlude airship (cost 1200z). Exit at Yuno then go downstairs to the terminal. Talk to the Airport Staff to take the airship to Hugel.  To begin this quest, you must be a level 40 or above Archer. You can also ask a Priest or Acolyte to warp you to Hugel.  Hugel is inside a house located at the northeastern corner of the town. Sherin will give you an interview consisting of 10 questions. In order to pass the test, you need have at least 90 points. The questions are quite easy and only required common sense:  You are an Archer, and you don't know where you should go to hunt. What do you do? (Quietly ask a person passing by, or Wander around alone and search for a place.) So you've decided on a place to hunt. You're going to hunt the monsters known as Hodes in the Sograt Desert. But you're in Payon! How do you get to the desert? (Use the Kafra service, or Walk with a friend.) There is no Priest to ask for a warp, and no friend is around to walk with you. You must use the Kafra service, but you have no Zeny! How would you go about to make the Zeny that you need? ( Sell items I do not need, or Hunt a nearby field.) So you finally arrive at the Sograt Desert. But you realize that Hodes are a bit too strong for you to hunt alone. What is your solution to this situation? (Go back to town.) Let's say you were having too much trouble hunting Hodes and returned to town. Now you are out of HP and a Priest happens to be around. How would you ask for a Heal? (Would it be possible to get a Heal, please?) This time, you found a rare item while you were going through your inventory. You go out to sell the item, and there are many people with stores and chatrooms open. What is the best way to sell your item? (Open a chat room and wait, or Look to see if anyone already wants it.) While you are waiting, someone is begging for items and Zeny. What should you do? (Give some of my items and Zeny.) By now, you decide to go to the Maze by yourself. But on your way, you run into someone that is lost. What should you do? (Tell them which way to go, or Guide them to their destination.) After meeting this lost person, you decide to get back to hunting. Just then, you find that someone is attacking a boss! What should you do? (Watch, then attack when asked for help.) You are now very exhausted after your day of hunting. It's time to go back to town. But what's this!? You find an expensive item lying on the floor! What should you do with it? (Try to find the owner, or Just walk by.)  , Demon Hunter is in the same room as Sherin. He will ask you to gather some items for him. There are at least 7 item sets, but you only need to finish one.  Item Set 1 - 3 Bill of Birds (from PecoPeco in Sograt Desert), 5 Skel-Bone (from Skeleton monsters in Payon Cave), and 3 Green Herb (from Green Plant or Poporing in Payon Field). Item Set 2 - 3 Venom Canine (from Boa or Anaconda in Sograt Desert), 3 Animal Skin (from Baby Desert Wolf in Sograt Desert), and 5 Red Herb (from Sohee and Eggyra in Payon Cave). Item Set 3 - 3 Dokebi Horn (from Dokebi in Payon Cave and Field), 3 Piece of Eggshell (from Eggyra in Payon Cave), and 10 Fluff (from Fabre in Prontera or Payon Field). Item Set 4 - 9 Yellow Herb (from Yellow Plant Sograt Desert), 9 Worm Peeling (from Andre in Ant Hell), and 9 Shell (from Andre and Ant Egg in Ant Hell). Item Set 5 - 3 Tooth of Bat (from Familiar in Payon Cave), 1 Sticky Mucus (from Zombie or Poporing in Payon Cave),and 1 Bear's Footskin (from Bigfoot in Payon Field). Item Set 6 - 1 Yoyo Tail (from Yoyo in Prontera Field), 2 Porcupine Quill (from Caramel in Prontera Field). and 1 Acron (from Coco in Prontera Field). Item Set 7 - 3 White Herb (from White Plant in Payon Cave), 5 Trunk (from Willow in Payon Field), and 5 Claw of Desert Wolf (from Desert World in Sograt Desert or Payon Field). After you have gathered the Items, give them to the Demon Hunter.  The Guild Master is in Payon Central Palace, and the Archer Guide is at the Payon Village. The two NPC can be found, but only one will give the test.  If you go to the wrong NPC, the other will refer you to the NPC at the other location. In this test, you will be warped into a room full of monsters. You will need to kill 4 of those monsters with the name Job Change Monster, so be careful while taking this test. You have to kill the 4 monsters within 3 minutes. Once you have successfully killed the 4 monsters, a switch will appear at the center of the room. Click the switch to have the exit appear in the room. You have to get in the exit within 30 seconds to pass the test. If you get knocked out, caught in a trap, or run out of time, you will fail the test and have to start over again.  After passing the quest, talk to the Guild Master again. She will give you a Necklace of Wisdom as proof of your success. Take the proof and show it to Hunter Sherin in Hugel, only then will she change you into a Hunter.  If you're at job level 50 when taking this quest, you will be rewarded with a Hunter Bow; otherwise, you will get a Crossbow. If you don't have the Necklace of Wisdom with you for any reason, you will have to start the quest all over again.  

head for hugel town.  talk to hunter sherin.  talk to demon hunter.  meet the hunter guild master or the archer guide.  change your job. 

 Fall and winter concerts are a great reason to break out your winter hats and beanies that have been stored away since the summer! Beanies look great for colder weather and will keep you warm throughout the concert. They will look good with your hair down, short hair, or styled into a long braid or two. Wearing a hat can also save you time styling your hair if you choose to use the hat as your main accessory. It can either accentuate or distract from your hair, depending on how you style it (or don’t).  If you have long hair, hot weather makes wearing your hair down uncomfortable and sweaty. Remedy this problem by styling it into a bun or ponytail. If you have short hair, you can style it as you normally would or tie or pin it back to keep it away from your face. By tying or styling your hair up and away from your face, you will be able to keep your hair getting sweaty or getting messed up during the concert.  For fall or winter outdoor concerts, you will want to dress in layers. You can pair a flannel shirt with a down vest or a bomber jacket with a long sleeve t-shirt. If you are opting for comfort as well as warmth, wear a sweatshirt with a pair of jeans and your favorite pair of sneakers.  Summer concerts great time to break out your cute summer clothes. Opt for a pair of high-waisted shorts with one of your favorite band shirts. For a trendier look, wear a crop top with your shorts. You could also choose to wear a tank top to keep you cool yet stylish, or perhaps a cute sundress you’ve been excited to wear somewhere.   Wear light-colored fabrics, which will reflect the sun, thereby keeping you a bit cooler., Unless you will be sitting the entire time, it won’t be comfortable or practical to wear a pair of high heels to an outdoor concert. You may have to walk up or down a hill in the grass if you will be in the lawn seating of an amphitheater. Most people will be using this time to relax and let loose with friends; you should let your shoe choice reflect this. Choose a pair of comfortable sandals, flats, or boots (depending on the temperature outside) to keep your feet comfortable and ready to dance at a moment’s notice!  

style your hair with a hat.  fix your hair in a bun or ponytail in hot weather.  pick an outfit that is stylish but will keep you warm.  choose an outfit that will keep you cool.  wear comfortable shoes. 

 Jack Russells specifically are happiest and most fulfilled when they have a job that they’re responsible for. Try to give your dog a job that fits the strengths of the breed. For instance, Jack Russells love to dig and hunt. If you give your dog the task of taking care of rodents in the yard and reward your dog when it does well with this job, then it probably won’t have as much hyper energy to exert.If you don’t have a yard for your Jack Russell to dig in, you can give it a cleaning job by commanding it to put away toys or give it a notification job by commanding it to bark when the mail truck or school bus drive by your home. Reward these actions with treats., Your Jack Russell may react to or reflect the energy that you put off. Do your best to have a calm and assertive presence. If you’re stressed about your job or frustrated about an argument you had, your dog will pick up on and be impacted by that nervous energy., Dogs sense the world first and foremost with their noses, so aromatherapy might have a powerful influence over your Jack Russell. Just like it has a calming effect on humans, lavender can relax dogs as well. Ask your veterinarian about other scents that may be specifically effective for calming your Jack Russell as well as safe application and dispersal methods.Sometimes essential oils are safe to apply directly to your dog’s skin, but you may want to consider purchasing a dog aromatherapy pre-mixed spray that’s already properly diluted and safe to spray throughout your home. 

give your dog a job.  remain calm and collected.  try aromatherapy. 

, You should hear your pen say 'Main menu', Then click on the right arrow to begin creating the keyboard., You may connect these with a top and bottom line if you wish. The pen will instruct you to add an 'I' and an 'R' to the drawing. Do this to indicate that these lines are a keyboard. Do not add any black keys, the pen will not register them., The seven notes you have created are the notes of the Major C scale on a standard piano or keyboard. If you wish to record your music, this tutorial can help you learn to record audio clips. 

turn on your livescribe pulse pen and get out a livescribe notebook.  ,  go to the main menu by tapping the point of the pen on the center of the arrow set.  click on the down arrow twice until your pen says the word piano.  draw nine straight lines, parallel to each other on the paper.  you may now tap on any key with the point of your pen to create sound. 

 Fill a pot with boiling water, then add the tea leaves. Cover the pot with a lid, and let the tea steep for 5 minutes   For a more traditional tea, use Thai black tea leaves.; , If you used a tea infuser, simply pull it out. If you used loose tea leaves, pour the tea into a separate pot through a fine, mesh sieve, and discard the loose leaves.  Add the sugar first, and stir it until it dissolves. Next, stir in the condensed milk.  If you are in a hurry, you can put the pot into an ice bath. Do this by filling a sink with ice, placing the pot into the sink, and then stirring the tea with a whisk while it cools down.  Fill 6 glasses with ice, then fill each glass ¾ of the way with tea.   If you need to make fewer servings, simply pour the rest of the tea into a pitcher, and store it in the fridge.  Evaporated milk is the most traditional, but you can also use whole milk, half-and-half, or coconut milk.  

steep the tea for 5 minutes.  strain the leaves out of the water.  stir in the sugar then the condensed milk.  let the tea cool to room temperature or colder.  pour the tea into ice-filled glasses.  top the glasses off with your choice of milk. 

 EBGames and other game stores are currently selling used Gamecubes for around $30-60, which is less than most next-gen GAMES cost nowadays.; , Thankfully, most used/new Gamecube games can be acquired very cheaply at most game stores. Below is a list of some Gamecube titles that shouldn't be overlooked:, It's an open-ended game, where you take the role of a human (I'm not sure what the character really is.....) in a village filled with anthropomorphic animals. Your goals are to buy a house, fill it with all sorts of furniture, pay off your debts, and generally just have fun, and there's lots to do, from fishing to contests to rare furniture, and much, much more. Think of it as a slightly different Sims game, except with talking animals. A must-buy for any Gamecube owner.  It's an unusual RPG with a great storyline and better-than-average graphics. It uses a turn-based battle system that revolves around "cards" called Magnus, which can be used for attack and defense. There are two games in this series- Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean and Baten Kaitos Origins. The original Baten Kaitos has a slower pace, in terms of battles, and the storyline is slightly better than Origins. Also, there are more party members to choose from in the original. In Origins, the battle pace is faster, providing an eclectic blend of turn-based and "real-time" strategy. The voice acting (yes, VOICE ACTING) is MUCH improved in this version, and the storyline and music is still top-notch.  It's a real-time RPG with a mildly interesting storyline and above-average graphics; although it may not be a must-buy, it's still worth a try.  It's sort of a "farming game" as far as genres go; you grow crops, sell them, explore the town, acquire various farming animals, fish, and much more. It may sound boring, but it is a very addictive and fun game once you've played it for a while.  For those of you unfamiliar with this franchise, it revolves around a young boy name Link who discovers that he is the true bearer of the mystical artifact known as the "Master Sword" and that he is destined to save the world from an evil being known as Ganon or Ganondorf. From the in-depth puzzles and dungeons to the innovative weapon selection and fast-paced action, the Legend of Zelda franchise is a pristine example of what a video game franchise SHOULD be. Another must-buy, although the large amounts of sailing in this game might be a turn-off to some.  Twilight Princess is a deep, multi-layered game, from the intriguing storyline to the solid gameplay. This game has a darker tone than most Zelda games, garnering the first T rating for a Zelda game in history. The enemy AI (artificial intelligence) is more advanced than Wind Waker's, and the human-to-wolf back-and-forth transformation within the game is an interesting novelty. This game has been called "the best Zelda game of all time," earning a 10 out of 10 in many reviews, and is an absolute must-buy for the Gamecube.  Lego Star Wars takes place in a Lego-like version of the Star Wars universe, and it relates the events of Star Wars Episodes I through III. Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy takes place during Star Wars Episodes IV through VI, so it's really a matter of taste and what Star Wars movies you prefer more. There are a few notable changes between the two titles; Lego Star Wars II has customizable characters, "bounty hunter mode", where you can play as several bounty hunters from the Star Wars franchise, and improved vehicles and bonus levels. Many reviews have called these two titles "fun, impressive..." and "The Best Gamecube Action Game of 2006." They have also won awards for "Best Gameplay", "Best Game Based On a Movie or TV Show," and "Best Children's Game."  , Hilarity ensues. This game puts an interesting spin on the series; a racing game instead of a platforming game. You can choose from a large cast of Nintendo characters and their distinctive cars, then it's off to the racetrack. This game features superb multiplayer modes, a large amount of courses, and the fact that a kart (car) can carry two drivers, one in the front and one in the back. This title has garnered many positive reviews, earning an average 9.5 out of 10. Definitely worth a look for racing fans and Mario fans alike.  These two games are no different. Metroid Prime's story revolves around a bounty hunter named Samus, who investigates a ship that sent out a distress signal.She finds out that it is owned by space pirates, only to discover that not everything is as it seems.........Echoes features a more "light-and-dark" storyline, and is quite different from the original Prime's storyline. These two games are sort of a combination between first-person shooters and action/adventure games. These two titles, especially Prime, have been critically acclaimed, garnering 10 out of 10s in many reviews and were chosen for the "Top 100 Games" list for GameFaqs, the "Top 100" list for IGN, and the original Prime is considered one of the best-selling games for the Gamecube, and stands as the third-highest-rated game of all time as of November 2007. A must-buy.  The storyline borrows quite a bit from the Cthulhu Mythos, and revolves around the female protagonist named Alexandria, who is investigating the mysterious murder of her grandfather. Eternal Darkness is notorious for its "sanity effects"; a green bar at the top of the screen measures how much "sanity" you have left. When it becomes low, very strange things happen in-game, including surreal events; a "blue screen of death"; when trying to save, instead of the usual "Do you wish to overwrite saved data" screen, there is a "Do you wish to delete all save files" with the options "Yes" and "Continue without saving." No matter what you do, all files appear to be deleted; insects swarming over the lens of the camera, game messages that claim that an "error" has occurred, and the inventory screen appearing to be empty. This game may not have achieved incredible commercial success, but it has been called the "#5 Scariest Game of All Time" by Game Informer and X-Play, and has earned a 92% average in most game reviews.  A turn-based battle system, based on the original Paper Mario, infuses this game, as well as the "audience" system; since most battles actually "take place" on a stage, the audience can boo or cheer you on, depending on how well you do, and you will be rewarded for how well you do by the audience. IGN has called this game "an absolute blast to play," and it was named "the 16th Best Gamecube Game of All Time" by IGN. It currently holds an average score of 88% on Game Rankings.  Unfortunately, it has gone down in popularity for game cube ever since the New Play Control! version came out. The basis of game play in Pikmin is to retrieve ship parts using strange plant-like creatures called "Pikmin"; there are different colors and types of Pikmin, each with their own unique powers. The story revolves around an odd creature named Captain Olimar, who, in order to save his company, must acquire a set amount of money to keep himself in business. He crash-lands on a bizarre planet along the way, and must use the native Pikmin to repair his ship and escape, all the while gathering valuable items, in 30 days, before his oxygen supply runs out. Most "game days" are 15 minutes in length, and Olimar must return to his ship along with his Pikmin squadron before the time limit is up, otherwise the native beasts will devour most of his Pikmin. The game also features a more difficult Challenge Mode, better-than-average graphics, and a unique style of gameplay. Pikmin has earned a 9.1 out of 10, an award for "Best Puzzle Game," an "outstanding" rating according to IGN, and is considered fun for gamers of all skill levels. Pikmin 2, Pikmin's sequel, was even more acclaimed than the original, mostly because the 30-day time limit was removed. There are also two more types of Pikmin in Pikmin 2, improved controls, easier multitasking, the addition of "sprays", a multiplayer feature, and the fact that a player can continue searching for treasure as long as he or she wishes, instead of only 30 days. Pikmin 2 has earned a 39/40 according to Famitsu, and IGN and Gamespot both gave the game a 9.3 out of 10. Another must-buy, especially Pikmin 2, seeing as it is the better of the two games.  But when he arrives at the village where Ashley is being held captive, he discovers that it has been taken over by horrific creatures known as Los Ganados, and a religious cult bent on world domination named Los Illuminados. Smarter and quicker than regular zombies, Los Ganados feature sophisticated AI. The game is well known for its solid gameplay, quick controls, item management, cinematic cutscenes and storyline, and fast-placed gun play. This game has earned several Game of the Year Awards, achieved Player's Choice Status, and has earned a 10 out of 10 in many reviews.  It has earned over 91% for all versions on Game Rankings.com, and has earned a 9.2 from IGN.  This game features many fun minigames, but the plot is very weak. It is an excellent multiplayer/party game, and has earned an E3 2002 Game Critic Award for Best Puzzle/Trivia/Parlor Game, and is a Player's Choice Game.  The game revolves around many popular Nintendo characters fighting it out on many different stages. The game features many diverse Nintendo characters, from Mario to Kirby to Fox, and much more, a ton of different items to use in battle, a rich and superb multiplayer mode, and dozens of trophies and various unlockables to acquire. Super Smash Bros. Melee is sixth on the Gamefaqs list of "Best...Game....Ever....", IGN's reader choice chose it as "Game of the Year," Electronic Gaming Monthly chose it as "Best Multiplayer Game" and "Best Gamecube Game," the 200th edition of Electronic Gaming Monthly selected Melee as #92 of the Most Influential Games of All Time on their "Top 200 Games of All Time" list, IGN named it the third "Best Gamecube Game of All Time" in 2007, and Gamespy chose it as fourth in a similar list. Melee has earned many, many 10 out of 10 reviews and is considered to be THE best Gamecube game ever. If you buy no other game for the Gamecube, buy Melee.

 Place the whole, uncut eggplant in a large paper bag and loosely wrap the excess paper around the side of the vegetable.   The paper bag absorbs moisture and, as a result, may reduce spoilage. Since paper is permeable, the eggplant can also receive adequate air flow. If you don't have paper bags, you could wrap the eggplant in paper towels and place it into an unsealed plastic bag or vented bowl. Do not place the eggplant in a sealed plastic bag since doing so can restrict air flow and increase decay.; , Keep the eggplant out of direct sunlight and in a relatively cool spot.   The ideal temperature for eggplant is 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius). Refrigerators are too cold, but standard room temperature is too warm. Dry, well-ventilated garages work well in cool weather seasons, but cellars and basements might be better during warmer weather., Do not store eggplants together or with other fruits and vegetables. Keep each eggplant separate while in storage.   Many fruits and vegetables produce ethylene gas as they ripen. When exposed to ethylene, eggplants tend to ripen and spoil faster.  When stored in this manner, most eggplants should remain edible for up to three days.   Ideally, however, you should use the eggplant within 24 hours for the best texture. Eggplants spoil quickly, even when stored correctly.  

wrap the eggplant in paper bags.  store the eggplant in a cool location.  keep the eggplant away from other produce.  use within three days. 

 It's been said before, but it's worth repeating. Poor form and more weight won't get you lifting more; proper form and less weight will. Here is a short list of several things you should pay attention to while you bench:   Squeeze the bar tightly to activate your triceps. Activating your triceps will ultimately help you lift more. Use your legs to create a solid base. Think of yourself as driving your back and traps into the bench, giving your chest and arms a foundation to push off against. Lift the bar up and down in a straight line. If lifting causes you to wobble back and forth when you bring the bar up and down, you are probably lifting too much weight. Switch to lower weight and practice proper form.  Muscles in the body are interconnected. That means that to fully tone your chest with the bench press, you need to pay attention to your triceps and back. One reason lifters often reach a plateau in weight is that they forget to work out their triceps, which help power the bench press.   To tone your triceps, make your grip smaller on the bench press. Also try to work out the triceps with dips, skull-crushers, and overhand cable extensions.To tone your upper back, try barbell rows, which happen to be the exact opposite of the bench press. With good form, this exercise should strengthen your back significantly.  The secret to gaining muscle mass is working out and eating right. Take your body weight in pounds and multiply that number by 18. This is the number of calories you should try to get into your body over the course of your day. Remember also to get a good balance of protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Shoot for 25-40% calories from protein; 15-40% calories from fat; and 35-45% calories from carbohydrates.  If you spend any amount of time watching others bench press, what you'll notice is that most people are a bit stronger with one arm — usually their dominant. What keeps many people at a plateau is their weak arm or side, as you can only lift as much as this arm will let you. To overcome this temporary limitation, work out your weak side more than normal. When either arms or sides are strong enough to work in tandem while bearing equal weight, watch your bench press skyrocket.  If the only chest exercise that you perform is the bench press, your body will adapt quickly. To take your bench press to the next level, you are going to have to find different exercises for your chest. Try them out to see what works for you. Even slight differences in exercises can yield drastic results. Here are some additional chest exercises that you can try to max out your bench press:   Dumbbell flyes Barbell incline/decline Pushups Chest press (incline or regular) Cable extensions  

hone your technique.  tone your back and triceps.  eat better and more to gain muscle.  make sure both arms are roughly equal in strength.  switch it up around the chest. 

 Hide the map somewhere that they can "discover it." Then encourage them to try to find the treasure! Try having them dress up or give the a "spyglass" made from a toilet paper roll to help them spy "landmarks."         

leave the map for your children. 

 Prior to steaming, always wash your spinach. You want to make sure you get off any contaminants prior to consuming the plant. Place the spinach in a colander and run it under tap water until it's slightly damp. If you don't have a colander, you can simply add the spinach to a bowl and swish it around as you run water over it.Afterwards, you can pat the spinach dry with a clean paper towel. You don't need to get the spinach completely dry, but you should make sure it's not dripping wet.; , Do not add more than two tablespoons, as there will still be droplets of water on the spinach. Make sure you choose a saucepan that can contain all your spinach. You should not have to cram the spinach into the saucepan. A saucepan that's too small will cause your spinach to not cook evenly throughout.Set the saucepan over medium heat to cook your spinach. If you can't find a big enough saucepan, you may have to cook your spinach in two batches.  You want to cook your spinach until it's just slightly wilted and soft. This generally takes around five minutes, but may take more or less depending on how much spinach you're cooking. Once your spinach is limp and bright green, you can remove the pan from the heat.You do not need to cover the spinach while it cooks. However, you should toss it with a pair of tongs to make sure it cooks evenly throughout. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the spinach to a colander.  Gently shake the colander over the sink. This should dry out any excess water. If you want, add seasonings to the spinach. Some herbs and lemon juice taste good with steamed spinach. Steamed spinach can work great as a side dish to most meals, and may pair well with something like meat if you need a vegetable.   Leftover spinach can be stored in the fridge.  

wash and dry the spinach.  pour two tablespoons of water into a medium saucepan.  add the spinach.  serve your spinach. 

 Solve T = 72 ÷ R. This is the same equation as above, just slightly rearranged. You simply enter a value for R. For example:   How long will it take for $100 to assume the purchasing power of $50, given an inflation rate of 5% per year?  Let 5 x T = 72, so that T = 72 ÷ 5, meaning T = 14.4. That's how many years it would take for money to lose half its buying power in a period of 5% inflation.   R x 10 = 72, where T = 10. Then R = 72 ÷ 10 = 7.2%.  If you detect general trends, don't worry about numbers that are wildly out of range. Drop them from consideration.  

estimate the time it would take to lose half of your money (or its purchasing power in the wake of inflation).  estimate the rate of decay (r) over a given time span: r = 72 ÷ t. enter a value for t, and solve for r. for example:  if the buying power of $100 becomes worth only $50 in ten years, what is the inflation rate during that time?,  ignore any unusual data. 

 The most important thing before you start castrating your cattle is to find out and think about what method you should use and/or are most comfortable with, according to what their stomach can handle and how sensitive they are to the animal's well being.   With these in mind, run through the pros and cons of each practice. Here's a list to consider.   Advantages to banding:  Bloodless (no blood is lost when banding or crushing the cords through the scrotal wall) Less chance of infection occurring because no open wounds are created More painless than cutting because the area quickly numbs after the band is put on: there is a little discomfort, but it goes away after a while. Quick and easy to do if done properly No risk of maggot infestation if done during the fly season Cutting off blood supply enables the testes and scrotum to gangrene and fall off on their own    Disadvantages to banding:  Mistakes can happen: put the rubber ring around the teste instead of the cord, one testicle is only banded because the other hasn't descended yet, ring is too brittle and comes off sooner than the scrotum starts to atrophy, etc. A little painful during the application, but the area goes numb very quickly soon after. Tetanus shot may be required as there is risk of infection as the scrotum atrophies and sloughs off.    Advantages to cutting:  Easy to see that two testes are present Quick and a highly common practice used among ranchers Great way to collect enough calf testes to make some Rocky Mountain or Prairie Oysters!    Disadvantages to cutting:  Risk of blood loss, infection and maggot infestation Cannot be performed during fly season Knife may not be sterilized, inducing infection Cutting the cord may not be done properly increasing the chance of blood loss for the animal More painful for the animal than banding, depending on the method of cutting used. Can cut oneself whilst castrating the animal: knives are sharp and must be handled properly and safely!    Advantages of using the Burdizzo pinchers:  Desirable for show steers because of the large and well-shaped cod that is formed in well-finished steers. Similar advantages as described above with banding. No tetanus shot required because there is no scrotal atrophy occurring    Disadvantages of using the Burdizzo pinchers:  Best done by an experienced operator or veterinarian One cord can only be cut at a time, and cannot slip from the clamps of the Burdizzo Mistakes are likely to occur if not done properly: the cord may be incompletely crushed and the animal may develop stagginess later.    ; , Depending on where you live, most castrating should be done during early spring or late fall. It can also be done in the wintertime, as the cold will constrict the blood vessels making it less likely for an animal to bleed out sooner.  One thing you should remember is that the younger the animal is done, the better. Bulls should be castrated no older than 8 months of age. Bulls can be castrated at any time, but you must remember that if you castrate a bull that is at least 12 months of age, you will notice a loss in productivity:   The older the animal is at castration, the greater the stress, risk of bleeding, and the slower the growth rate for that animal. On average, calves are castrated around 8 weeks of age or sooner. Some producers, depending on how busy they are and their willingness to go out to the pasture to find calves to tag and castrate, will steer a bull calf when it is a day to two days old. Other producers would rather run the calves through a chute when they're around two and a half months old when they can castrate, tag and vaccinate them all in one go.  

choose the best castrating method to use.  decide when to castrate your animals.  what age is best to castrate? 

 Salicylic acid helps reduce swelling and redness. It has the added bonus of helping to unclog pores. There are gels, wipes, creams, cleansers, moisturizers, and sprays that contain this drug. Try whichever one you think will best fit into your daily routine. Start with a 2% solution of the acid so your skin doesn't dry out., The salicylic acid in aspirin constricts the blood vessels and reduces facial inflammation quite well. To make a topical mask, break a tablet of aspirin in half. Mix a few drops of water with the white powder inside the tablet until a paste forms. Apply the paste directly to your acne. Cover with an adhesive bandage for about 30 minutes.   If you have a tablet form of aspirin, crush the pill and add water to it until it makes a paste. After 30 minutes pass, the blood vessels should have constricted. The acne and surrounding skin should be notably less red., If you suffer from chronic or severe adult acne, standard skin care products purchased at the store may not be enough to help clear your skin. This is usually when a dermatologist will prescribe a stronger topical cream or ointment to treat your acne with. A doctor can also prescribe oral antibiotics, laser or light treatments, chemical peels, and microdermabrasion.   A doctor might prescribe oral antibiotics to kill the bacteria causing your breakouts. Hormone-regulating medication, such as birth control pills and spironolactone, which was originally a hypertension drug, might be prescribed as well.Usually, topical creams and ointments include ingredients like topical antibiotics, retinoids, sulfur, benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid. It is not unusual for prescriptions to include a combination of these treatments.  

use salicylic acid.  apply aspirin topically.  get a prescription medication. 

 This is a matter of personal preference, but since you can choose between any photos you have taken with your phone camera and images you have downloaded, you may want to search online for an image you enjoy to use as your screen saver.

 If you own a business, you need a website. It doesn't need to be fancy, but it does need to present essential information to potential customers.Things like your business' contact information, product descriptions, an online store, etc.   Use search engine optimization (SEO) to ensure your website isn't buried on the last page of a search engine. To do this, you'll need to provide interesting, unique content on your website, use keywords, and get other websites to link back to yours.  This is also sometimes referred to as Search Engine Marketing (SEM) or pay-per-click (PPC) marketing.

But you have to be savvy and develop a successful strategy.LinkedIn, Google, Facebook and Twitter all offer paid channel advertising.  The most common forms of paid channel advertising are cost-per-mille (CPM) and cost-per-click (CPC). CPM ads are the banners you see across the tops of webpages. You are billed a flat rate based on the number of times the ad is displayed. CPC ads are the paid advertising results you see on a Google search results page or in the side margin on a Facebook page. You pay for every click on your ad.CPM is a cost per 1000 views and that it means that the ad is exposed, but not necessarily read or noticed. CPC is much more expensive since the reader has taken the time to "click through" to the website.  Use strategies that let you get the most from your ads.

 Mix together 1 Tbsp (15 ml) honey with 1/2 Tbsp (7.5 ml) organic, raw whole milk. Massage the cleanser into your skin, focusing on the areas polluted by wrinkles.   After 10 minutes, rinse the cleanser off with lukewarm water. Honey has humectant compounds, meaning that it is capable of absorbing and retaining moisture in the skin, thereby increasing the elasticity of skin and reducing the appearance of wrinkles. The lactic acid in milk is capable of cleaning the debris found deep inside of your skin's pores. As a result, more natural collagen is secreted.  Mix 1 tsp (5 ml) raw organic sugar with 2 Tbsp (30 ml) real lemon juice. Massage this over your skin but do not get it in your eyes.   Rinse the solution off with cool water after 10 minutes pass. The glycolic acid in sugar repairs skin damage. Lemon juice contains citric acid, which is abrasive enough to gently scrub away dead skin cells so that layers of soft skin can show through. The vitamin C in lemon juice also contributes to collagen production.  Whip the separated egg whites of two organic eggs using an electric mixer or whisk until soft peaks form. Apply the egg whites on your face, focusing on your wrinkles.   Rinse the egg whites away with cool water after 20 minutes. Egg whites provide a quick but temporary fix. The egg whites have astringent properties that temporarily cause the skin to become firmer.  Steep a handful of lemon balm in 2 cups (500 ml) of boiling water. Once cool, use the solution to rinse your face each morning.   Lemon balm is an herb in the mint family. This plant contains astringent properties that can quickly yet temporarily tighten your skin, thereby reducing the appearance of wrinkles.    Try a mix made with 2 tsp (10 ml) extra virgin olive oil and 2 drops of carrot seed oil. Massage the combination into your skin for 30 seconds before rinsing with warm water.  Certain foods have properties that can improve the quality of your skin.   Antioxidants can fight the free radicals responsible for worsening your skin condition, including those leading to the production of wrinkles. Consume foods high in antioxidants, like blueberries. Note that many vitamins also double as antioxidants. B-complex vitamins can be found in meat, eggs, and whole wheat. Vitamins A, C, and E are often found in fresh fruit and leafy green vegetables. Almonds also contain a high level of vitamin E. Eat more chocolate. Dark chocolate with at least 72 percent cacao contains antioxidants. It also contains epicatechin and catechin, both of which protect your skin from harmful UV sunlight.Look for foods containing omega-3 fatty acids, like salmon and other cold-water fish. These fatty acids keep your skin hydrated.  Focus on massaging your lymph nodes to drain away excess water-weight in your face.   Rub in a circular motion using your index and middle finger. Start below the ear and travel down the side of the neck and toward the collarbone. Afterward, move from beneath your chin, under your jawbone, and out toward your ears. Massage the skin from the inner corners of your eyes to the outer corners. Move to the temples and travel down both sides of your face. Repeat each step five times for maximum effect.  

create a milk and honey cleanser.  exfoliate with lemon juice and sugar.  apply an egg white mask.  use a lemon balm rinse.  wash your face with oil.oils that contain linoleic acid help the skin to stay hydrated, which also helps to reduce the effect of wrinkles.  monitor your diet.  massage your wrinkles away.a quick facial massage can create firmer skin within minutes. 

 Start with undergarments that are made from synthetic nylon, polyester or spandex blends and offer moisture wicking. That means less chafing and more comfort. Women might want to wear a sports bra, which are built for warm and sweaty conditions., Yes, it's hot, but protecting your skin from the elements is vital. Think loose, lightweight cotton pants in light colors, such as khakis or cargo pants. Looser pants keep air moving and help evaporate sweat. Long pants also help protect your legs from spiny plants.  Long-sleeved, slightly loose cotton shirts are your best bet. Make sure your collarbone and chest are covered too. Choose light colors that help reflect the sun's rays.Layering a t-shirt or tank top may be helpful under your long-sleeved shirt, so you can remove your top layer in shady spots and cool off a bit. Choose a close-fitting, wicking fabric.  Deserts can get surprisingly cold at night. A windproof shell will protect against gusts. For cooler months or nights, a fleece pullover is ideal. Fleece dries quickly and can be used as a pillow in a pinch. If you get lost or stuck, a jacket or space blanket can help prevent hypothermia., If your feet aren't happy, the rest of you won't be either. Make sure they're a snug-fitting blend that wicks moisture, and rise to crew length (mid-calf), so no sun or scorpions can sneak through.It may seem counterintuitive, but merino wool is a great bet for a natural wicking fabric on hot summer days. It also repels odors.Avoid all-cotton socks, which keep moisture close to your feet and can cause blisters.  This is the place to spend the most money. Boots are a vital part of your gear, and can protect you from injury, snakes, spines and heat. Wearing higher-cut hiking boots offers additional ankle support. You may need to go a size up from your normal shoes.   Choose a sturdy, slip-free sole that will work well on rocks and rough terrain. Depending on terrain, you'll probably want trail or rough-trail rated boots. Look for a pair that's got some ventilation for hot desert conditions.Look for adequate padding around your ankle, which is critical for long-wear comfort.When trying on boots, make sure you wear the same socks you'll be wearing to hike.  Wide-brimmed is best, but if you're attached to your baseball cap, add a bandana to cover your neck. Add a strap to make sure strong winds don't carry your hat away. , Make sure they offer complete UV protection. Look for a broad-spectrum sunscreen, at least SPF 30. Apply liberally to any exposed skin, including lips and hands. Bring a small tube for reapplying.  Pick one that fits comfortably and distributes weight evenly. Travel light. Your heaviest items should be water and food., Being dehydrated in the desert can be deadly. A good rule of thumb is to drink a liter per hour, more if you're hiking in temperatures above 85F/30C. , You'll need quick energy with all the calories hiking in the desert can burn. Sports bars, trail mix, sandwiches, dried fruit and jerky are popular options. Look for non-perishable options. , A first aid kit, signal mirror, flashlight and compass should be in your pack. You may not need them, but if you do, you'll be glad to have them on hand.  

wear wicking underwear.  wear long pants.  cover your arms.  dress for the weather.  wear moisture-wicking socks.  invest in good boots.  don't forget a hat.  remember sunglasses and sunscreen.  use a lightweight backpack.  bring plenty of water.  bring food.  pack vital survival supplies. 

 The ground must be made of dirt. Ideally, the ground should not be near anything that could block out the sunlight, such as trees.  Dig a row and leave two rows untouched. These rows will be filled with water to hydrate the crops.  Make a bucket using three iron ingots. Find a source of water and collect it in the bucket., Each block should have water to make an infinite water source.  Fences will protect your farm from animals and mobs, which could break your crops., The block will change texture. As the block sits, it will become more and more hydrated. Once the block is dark brown, move on to the next step.  Using gather seeds, plant crops onto the plowed dirt. You will see the plants begin to sprout.  Once your crop has fully grown, you can collect it by break the block., You will receive the crop as well as extra seeds to repeat the process. Replant the seeds to make a never-ending source of food and crops.  

find an area of flat land.  dig out rows of dirt.  fill a bucket with water.  pour water onto every block in the dugout rows.  surround the farm with fences.  use a hoe, plow out the higher part of the row.  plant desired seeds.  collect fully grown crops.  repeat the planting steps. 

 Sometimes, you have a large spreadsheet full of formulas, and you want to copy them exactly. Changing everything to absolute cell references (as described in the section on cell references) would be tedious, especially if you just want to change them back again afterward. Use this method to quickly move formulas with relative cell references elsewhere without changing the references.Here's our example spreadsheet, which needs to have column C duplicated to column D:    Example Spreadsheet   Column A Column B Column C Column D   row 1 944 Frogs =A1/2    row 2 636 Toads =A2/2    row 3 712 Newts =A3/2    row 4 690 Snakes =A4/2     If you're just trying to copy the formula in a single cell, skip to the last step ("Try alternate methods") in this section.  On most versions of Excel, you can find this by clicking the Home tab at the top of the Excel window, then clicking Find & Select in the "Editing" portion of the tab.You can also use the keyboard shortcut, CTRL F.  Enter "=", click "Find All," then enter another character into the "Replace with" box. This will automatically turn all formulas (which always begin with =) into text strings beginning with some other character. Always use a character that you have not used in your spreadsheet. For example, replace it with # or &, or a longer string of characters, such as ##&.    Example Spreadsheet   Column A Column B Column C Column D   row 1 944 Frogs ##&A1/2    row 2 636 Toads ##&A2/2    row 3 712 Newts ##&A3/2    row 4 690 Snakes ##&A4/2     Do not use the characters * or ?, since these will make later steps more difficult.  You may now select any cells you wish to copy, then paste them into another location. Since they are no longer interpreted as formulas, they will be copied exactly.    Example Spreadsheet   Column A Column B Column C Column D   row 1 944 Frogs ##&A1/2 ##&A1/2   row 2 636 Toads ##&A2/2 ##&A2/2   row 3 712 Newts ##&A3/2 ##&A3/2   row 4 690 Snakes ##&A4/2 ##&A4/2   , Now that you have the formulas where you want them, use the "Find all" and "Replace with" options to reverse your change. In our example, we'll look for the character string "##&" and replace it with "=" again, so those cells become formulas once again. You can now continue editing your spreadsheet as usual:    Example Spreadsheet   Column A Column B Column C Column D   row 1 944 Frogs =A1/2 =A1/2   row 2 636 Toads =A2/2 =A2/2   row 3 712 Newts =A3/2 =A3/2   row 4 690 Snakes =A4/2 =A4/2   , If the method described above does not work for any reason, or if you are worried about accidentally changing other cell contents with the "Replace all" option, there are a couple other methods you can try:   To copy a single cell's formula without changing references, select the cell, then copy the formula shown in the formula bar near the top of the window (not in the cell itself). Press esc to close the formula bar, then paste the formula wherever you need it.Press Ctrl` (usually on the same key as ~) to put the spreadsheet in formula view mode. Copy the formulas and paste them into a text editor such as Notepad or TextEdit. Copy them again, then paste them back into the spreadsheet at the desired location.Press Ctrl` again to switch back to regular viewing mode.  

use this method to quickly copy a formula without changing the cell references.  open the find window.  find and replace "=" with another character.  copy and paste the cells.  use find & replace again to reverse the change.  try alternate methods.

 Teach others the art of telling stories by first becoming an engaging storyteller.   Take a storytelling class. Sign up for a storytelling workshop at a college or community center. Practice telling stories. Strengthen your storytelling skills by taking the opportunity to tell relevant stories whenever possible to your colleagues, students, friends, relatives and neighbors.; , Attentiveness, laughter, an emotional response and/or sustained eye contact are indications that you are achieving your storytelling goal. A listener's attempts to change the subject, fidgety mannerisms and general inattentiveness may indicate a need to adjust the pace, tone, details or other elements of your storytelling technique.  If you are losing the attention of your listeners, make sure that your story is relevant to your audience and that it has a clear beginning, middle and an end. Identify your reason for telling the story and whether it will meet the needs of your listener.   Use props, sounds and visual tools. If teaching young children, a story about a cat with a strange meow will capture their attention more if accompanied by your enactment of the actual meow. To persuade adults to conform to your opinion or to sell a product, using pictures and presentation software may enhance the story and help you to achieve the storytelling goal.  You will know that you have mastered storytelling when children ask that you retell a story or adults ask you to share the story with others. Other indications that you are a storytelling master are sustained engagement on the part of your listeners and/or positive changes in behavior as a result of telling a story.  Your students may be young children in a school where you are already a teacher. Or they may be adults who report to you in a marketing firm where you are a manager.    Give explanations and structure to children. Young children need structured activities, continual guidance and verbal instructions. Provide a syllabus, handout and reading materials to adults. Teens and adults are more self-directed and benefit from materials that they can read on their own, such as an explanation of storytelling techniques and upcoming assignments.  Share the knowledge and skills that you gained in the process of becoming an effective storyteller.   Ask the class to think of an interesting story. Provide ideas related to the particular age group and goal of the class. A public speaking class intended to improve an adults social life will tell different types of stories than a group of salespeople trying to sell a product.  Observe your own engagement while listening to students' stories, as well as classmates' reactions. Pay particular attention to the storytelling speed, tone, details, gestures, props and graphics tools.   Encourage students by providing positive feedback. Public speaking is a prevalent fear, so comment on things that students did well to generate a desire to continue perfecting their storytelling skills. Provide constructive criticism. Instead of saying that a story was boring, draw the student's attention to areas of the story that can be enlivened by adding interesting details or voice inflections.  

learn effective storytelling techniques.  notice the reactions of others to your stories.  improve your storytelling skills.  determine if you are ready to teach storytelling to others.  identify the age group of your storytelling class.  assess the needs of the specific age group and plan accordingly.  teach storytelling techniques.  give feedback to students. 

 For the cake pops, you’ll need a prepared 15.25 ounce (432 g) box of cake mix. Read the package instructions to determine what other ingredients to add to it and how to mix the batter properly.In most cases, you’ll need to add water, some type of oil, and eggs to the box cake mix. You can use any flavor of cake mix that you like for the cake pops. Batters that are lighter in color, such as vanilla or lemon, may work better, though, because you’re covering them with light colored candy melts. If you prefer, you can use your favorite from-scratch cake recipe for the cake pops.; , After you’ve mixed the cake batter, pour it into a greased 9-inch by 13-inch (23-cm by 33-cm) cake pan. Next, place the cake in the oven and bake it according to the package instructions.You can use a nonstick cooking spray or coat it with shortening or butter and lightly dust it with flour to grease the cake pan. The packaging instructions will likely require preheating your oven to a certain temperature. Read the instructions carefully so you can start to preheat the oven before you mix the batter.  When the cake is finished baking, remove the pan from the oven. Let the cake sit in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes afterward, so it has time to cool., When the cake has cooled, use a knife to loosen it and remove it from the pan. Use clean hands to crumble the cake into a large bowl.If there are any hard or burnt bits in the cake, remove them as you break it up.  Once the cake is crumbled in the bowl, add 1 cup (256 g) of frosting and mix well. If the mixture is crumbly and dry, you can mix in up to another cup (256 g) of the frosting until there is no cake visible and no frosting lumps.You can use any flavor of frosting that you like for the cake pops. Both store-bought and homemade will work.. It’s usually easier to create a smooth cake pop mixture if you use clean hands to blend the crumbled cake and frosting together.  To make create the cake pops, you’ll need a 1 to 1 ½ tablespoon (37 to 56 g) cookie scoop. Use it to scoop out a small amount of the cake pop filling and place it in the palm of a clean hand.If you don’t have a cookie scoop, you can use a regular tablespoon measuring spoon. Fill it with a generous amount of the cake pop filling. You can adjust the size of the balls depending on your preference. However, be careful not to make them too large or they may not stay on the lollipop sticks.  When the cake pop filling in the palm of your hand, roll it into a ball. Make sure that it’s smooth and uniform in size, and place it on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.You can substitute wax paper or a silicone baking mat for the parchment paper if you prefer.  After you’ve rolled all of the filling into balls, cover the cookie sheet with plastic wrap. Place the balls in the refrigerator to chill for 1 to 2 hours, or until they are firm.If you are in a hurry, you can place the cake pop balls in the freezer for just 30 minutes to firm them up.  For the flower cake pops, you’ll need 24 ounces (680 g) of yellow candy melts. Place them in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave them on high for a minute. Stir the mixture, and microwave it for another 45 seconds on medium-high.Be careful not to overheat the candy melts. If they aren’t melted after a minute and 45 seconds, continue to heat them in 10 seconds intervals, stirring after each. You can use any color of candy melt that you like for the cake pops, but the coating will cover the outside of the flower’s center so yellow usually works best.  When the candy melts are ready, remove the cake pop balls from the refrigerator. Dip a lollipop stick into the melted candy melts and then insert it halfway into the cake pop balls.Make sure to cover a ¼ inch (6-mm) of the end of the lollipop stick before pressing it into the cake pop ball.  With the stick in place, carefully dip the cake pop into the melted candy melts. Move it up and down in a smooth motion to ensure that it’s completely coated. Gently Tap the pop against the side of the bowl to remove the excess and place it in a cake pop stand.Be careful not to move the pop around in the candy melts too much or you may loosen the stick. If you don’t have a cake pop stand, a piece of craft foam works well to hold the cake pops upright as they set.  While the candy melt coating is still soft, add a few white sprinkles to the top of the ball. Repeat the process of coating and adding sprinkles to all of the cake pops and allow them to dry for 30 to 60 minutes.You can substitute any color of sprinkles for the white.  For the flower cake pops, you’ll need 24 ounces (680 g) of premade, precolored fondant in your choice of color. Break off a small piece of the fondant and roll it with a rolling pin until it’s smooth and approximately ¼ inch (6-mm) thick.You can use any color of fondant that you’d like to form the cake pop flowers’ petals. To keep the fondant from sticking to the surface and rolling pin, grease them lightly with shortening.  When the fondant is rolled out, use a 2-inch (5-cm) flower-shaped cookie cut to cut out the cake pops’ petals. Repeat the process to make enough flowers for all of the cake pops, rolling out more fondant as necessary., After you’ve cut out all of the flower shapes, carefully lift the fondant flower off your work surface. Use a hole punch to create a small hole in the center of the flower.If you don’t have a hole punch, you can use a sturdy straw to create holes in the fondant.  Once the fondant flower has a hole it the center, place the lollipop stick from a cake pop through the hole. Press the foundation petals up around the cake pop to form the flower. Repeat the process with all of the cake pops.The fondant will remain soft, so be careful when you handle it. The fondant will be slightly tacky, which means it should adhere to the cake pop without any help.  When you’ve finished forming all of the cake pops into flowers, they are ready to serve. For a striking presentation, place the pops in a vase like real flowers and set out on your dessert table.If you like, you can hot glue green ribbon around the lollipop sticks to create decorative “stems” for the cake pop flowers.  

prepare the cake mix according to the package instructions.  bake the cake according to the package instructions.  allow the cake to cool.  crumble the cake.  mix in the frosting.  scoop out some of the filling.  roll the filling into balls.  chill the balls until they are firm.  melt the candy melts.  dip the lollipop sticks into the candy melts and press into the balls.  coat the balls with the candy melts.  add the sprinkles to the balls and let them set.  roll out the fondant in small sections.  use a cookie cut to create flower shapes.  punch a small hole in the center of the fondant flowers.  slide the flower over the lollipop stick and press around the cake pop.  arrange the cake pops in a vase to serve. 

 If your cabinet is a standalone piece, try to move it outside. If the cabinet is attached to the wall, cover your floors and counters with a painter's cloth or a cheap, plastic tablecloth. Move anything that might get stained by paint to a safer place.   This method is suitable for painted, varnished, and unpainted cabinets. It will be easier on an unpainted cabinet, however.; , Put them inside a box or a plastic, re-sealable bag so that they all stay together. Consider taping the screws to their corresponding hinges, knobs, and handles.  It roughs up the surface and gives the stain and paint something to stick to. Your weathering will last a lot longer as a result.If you are working on a painted or varnished cabinet, keep sanding the until the raw wood starts to show. These areas will eventually get the stain, so the more you sand, the more weathered your cabinet will look.  Get out your vacuum cleaner, and vacuum the floor. Wipe down the cabinets with a tack cloth. Follow up with a damp cloth. If your cabinets are in the kitchen, consider using an ammonia-based household cleaner or a degrease to get rid of any oil residue.   Make sure you get rid of all the sawdust. Any dust that remains will get into your stain and/or paint, and mar the surface.You'll get a messy finish instead of a weathered one.  This includes glass paneling and the edges of the walls around your cabinets. Not only will you be keeping these areas safe and clean, but you'll also get nice, crisp lines later on.  This is the color that will peek through your paint after you "weather" it:You may need two to three layers of stain. Be sure to let each layer dry before applying the next.   Consider going over the cabinet with a steel wire brush first. This will open up the wood grain and help the stain and/or paint to soak in better., It’s easiest to do this with a bristly paintbrush. This will protect the stain from the paint. The paint won't stick to these areas. When you are done painting, these areas will show through as "Weathering."Try to keep these areas random but keep in mind that most weathering will occur on corners and edges.  It is better to apply many thin coats than one thick coat; it will give you the smoothest finish and lessens the appearance of brushstrokes. Most paints will dry to the touch and be ready for another coat in 30 minutes to 2 hours. Check the label on your can.  Use 220 grit sandpaper this time. It will smooth down any brush strokes, and remove the excess wax or petroleum jelly. When you are done, vacuum your floor up and wipe the cabinet down with a tack cloth.   You can also use a steel wool pad to rub at the areas with the wax/petroleum jelly. This lets the stain show through.  If you really want to give your cabinets that old look, you'll need some antiquing glaze. Get out a clean rag and dip it into the glaze. You don't need a lot—a small amount will go a long way. Next, rub the glaze onto the cabinet using a small, circular motion. Let the glaze dry for the time specified by the manufacturer's directions.   If you want a crackly look, use a crackle glaze instead. For large, wide cracks, apply a thick coat. For finer, more spidery cracks, apply a thinner coat. Once the cabinet is covered in glaze, you can smooth out the circular marks with a clean rag. Wipe the glaze up and down or side-to-side to get a lined look. If you’d like to darken the edges or small corners, apply the glaze using a small brush.  With a rag wrapped around your finger, wipe away any glaze that’s inadvertently gotten in places you wish it weren’t. After this stage, allow your cabinets to dry before adding a topcoat.   It's best to wait 24 hours, or at the very least overnight. You don't want to the two coats meshing together and marring your artwork. All the rags you've used should be washed together but separate from your other linens in your washing machine in case the glaze stains.  If you can, try to find a sealer that is non-yellowing. A good sealer to use is a polycrylic sealer. Avoid using polyurethane, if you can, as those tend to yellow over time.How long the coats take to dry will depend on the sealer itself. Most sealers will dry within 2 to 3 hours, but you might want to refer to the label for more specific drying times. Check the label to make sure yours is non-yellowing. Some sealers need a curing period as well. This can take several hours to a few days. Do not get impatient or try to rush through. If you don't let your work cure properly, you'll get a sticky, tacky, gummy finish.  Check the label on the can that your sealer came in. Some sealers need a few days' curing time. This means that until they fully cure, the sealer will be sticky. During this time, you will want to leave the cabinets open so that they don't "glue shut. Once the sealer is fully dry and/or cured, you can replace the hinges, knobs, and handles.  

protect your work area.  remove knobs, handles, and any other hardware.  sand down the entire surface of the cabinet using a 60 to 80 grit sandpaper.this is necessary for painted, varnished, and even unpainted cabinets.  vacuum your work area and wash the cabinets down to get rid of any dust.  mask off the areas you do not want to be painted with painter's tape.  rub a stain or glaze into the surface of the wood using a piece of cloth.  apply wax or petroleum jelly to the areas you want to distress.  apply a few coats of acrylic or latex furniture-grade paint, letting each layer to dry in between.  lightly sand the cabinet again once the paint is fully dry, and be sure to remove all the dust.  consider applying some antiquing glaze for an aged look.  remove excess glaze, if necessary.  apply three coats of a clear sealer, allowing each coat dry before applying the next one.  make sure that the sealer has fully cured before you replace the hardware on the cabinets. 

 One of the best ways to minimize your chances of feeling anxious is through preparation. Symptoms of panic and anxiety often arise due to the unknowns of a situation, so mapping out an activity or event beforehand may help. Do as much as you can in advance to reduce panic later.For example, if you are on edge because of an upcoming job interview, figure out your route ahead of time to reduce your chances of arriving late. Practice questions with a friend or roommate. Ready your outfit the night before.; , Sometimes nervous jitters can be easily reduced or eliminated if you just change your inner dialogue to be more positive. Words hold a lot of power over how you feel, especially if the words have a negative undertone. As you feel the onset of increased nerves and jitters, do a check in with your words.   Ask yourself, “What words are flowing through my mind that scare me?” Perhaps they are things like, “I’m going to do terrible on that test,” “She'll never say yes if I ask her out,” or “If I try to parallel park here, I will mess up and everyone will see.” When you pay more attention to your internal dialogue, you can usually see that your thoughts are exaggerated, devastating, and down right destructive. Any time you catch yourself with negative thoughts, take a moment to change them. Replace each negative thought with two or three positive ones. For example, “I studied hard and will ace that test tomorrow,” or “Even if I got a B on that test, I will know I did my best and it is still a great grade.”  , The jitters often feel like pent-up energy inside your body. There’s no better way to release this energy than by moving your body. This can translate to intense physical activity like running or lifting weights. However, you can also simply take your dog for a walk around the block or turn on some music and dance.If you feel jittery before an event, try shaking your hands, stretching, or jumping up and down to alleviate the edgy feeling.  Typically, when you feel the jitters, you lock your attention on the situation that’s making you anxious. You can stop the jitters by distracting your mind from the panic-inducing event. Distraction techniques can include virtually anything.   Try striking up a conversation with someone sitting nearby. Grab a pen and paper and doodle. Or, write down a reassuring quote over and over again, such as “This too shall pass.” Read a book or listen to some music., Laughing is a great way to relax the body and mind in an anxiety-provoking situation. You might call up a buddy who has a strong sense of humor, tell a joke, or watch a funny YouTube video. A quick laugh may calm jitters and help you regain control of your nerves.  Calm breathing is an excellent technique for managing the jitters. This exercise involves taking slow, controlled breaths to decrease the heart rate and relax the body. Taking deep breaths and purposefully slowing your body movements increases oxygenated blood flow throughout your body as it courses through all of your organs, including your brain. This increase of oxygenated blood flowing to your brain improves your thinking and your ability to think logically. Spend a few minutes focusing completely on your breath and you’ll notice the jitters have faded.Purposely make your outflow of breath slower than your intake, as this mimics the breathing you have when you are sleeping, tricking our brain and body to become more relaxed. Breathe in through your mouth. Hold for a few counts. Then, release the air through your nose. Count as you go through each cycle. In and out, “one.” In and out, “two.” And, so on.  Trying hard to be perfect is one of the main reasons you may experience jitters. You fear failure, rejection, or embarrassment so your body gets shaky and wound up. Tackle your perfectionist tendencies and you can stop the jitters in their tracks.You can cope with perfectionism by getting some perspective. What is it that you are so worried about? Common causes of concern are someone laughing at you or making a fool of yourself. Think about how often that has happened in the past. Then, remind yourself “It’s very unlikely that they will laugh at me.”  

prepare in advance.  reframe your thinking.  move your body to release energy.  distract yourself.  count on humor.  try deep breathing.  kick perfectionism to the curb. 

 Most paints are not good news if you eat them.  This time it's a good idea to do a dry run on some paper or waste plastic when you're ready.  If you can't make one, print out a template from the internet. This saves time and more importantly, money. , For best results with a spray, cover as much of the room up as possible, or do it outside. Then go hell for leather. For best results with a brush, do things slowly, with care, and don't get distracted.  It usually says how long on the can, but if you aren't convinced, leave overnight in a dry place at room temperature and return in the morning.  The necessary equipment leaves marks, the stripper damages the electronics and the eBay value just skyrocketed on your one-of a-kind hand-painted 3DS. Not that you'd ever sell it.  

take precautions.  like with stickers, think about content before you apply.  make a template.  shield the other parts of your 3ds with some paper and masking tape, making sure that template is well stuck down if you made one.  ,  use appropriate brushes or spray cans.  leave an appropriate time for your work to dry.  don't try to remove the paint. 

 If you have dark hair, and you do not have much experience dying it yourself, seeking a professional stylist is the best way to dye it white blonde and ensure you safely achieve the desired shade.  The cost to dye your hair white blonde varies by how drastic the change will be. Expect to pay between $60 and $200.   The longer, darker and thicker the hair, the longer it will take to dye white blonde and the more a salon is likely to charge you.  Hair salons vary in price and quality, but paying a higher price doesn’t always ensure a higher quality service.   Be sure to read online reviews of hairstylists and talk to people whose hair color you admire. Ask them who they use. You’re better off finding a specific person than a general salon.  Good hair stylists usually book weeks or even months in advance, so call ahead of time to ensure an appointment.   Describe your hair as it is now and what you would like it to look like it to look like. Your hairstylist needs to be aware of how long the color treatment will take. Even if your stylist does not give you a time estimate, make sure that you leave ample time to dye your hair. The process can take anywhere from two to four hours, especially if your hairstylists is attending to other clients in between your processes. Agree on a price over the phone so that you have a clear understanding of how much the color treatment will cost before you walk into the salon.  It is very helpful for your hairstylist to see a picture of how you want your hair to look. Consider finding a photo in a magazine, printing one out or having one on your phone to show him or her.  

find a professional stylist to bleach your hair.  know your budget.  research salons.  book an appointment.  bring a visual to your appointment.

 This can be your boyfriend, a crush, even your husband or simply a good friend.; , Guys can (and often will) think and act differently depending on who they're talking to. If you see him with a bunch of guys talking about hot girls, sex, and performing seemingly stupid actions, then don't assume this is how he naturally thinks. Watch him when he's with a bunch of girls. If you see him being polite, complimentary, and inoffensive, he may just be trying to impress them. While this is most likely how he behaves, he may just be inflating things a little bit to show off.. Talk to him in mixed company, or even on the phone and he'll probably act more like his true self. Also, become good enough friends with him and talk to him in private, and he'll more than likely reveal his true self.  If all you see him as is some rowdy boy, then bring up a topic about social issues or something serious. You may find he's deeper than you gave him credit for. If all you see him as is some nerdy egghead, bring up music or popular culture, you may find that he's interested in more than just science and math.  If a guy keeps repeating something you asked him not to do, he most likely sees you as a nagging person even though he pretends to be listening. If you want to know if he is listening just ask him what he thinks of what you just said. This is also a great way to make him participate in the conversation.  if you think he doesn't like you, and want to see if he really likes you as a friend, don't be afraid to start the conversation. Most guys would actually prefer to participate in a conversation than to initiate it themselves. Being straightforward and confident works wonders!  , This will most likely end up with him unknowingly yet subtly telling you what opinions he has about different things and how he thinks about them. You may also find that you two share a lot more in common than meets the eye!  , A good chat a day works well. Long conversations should only be made with the guys that you know very well or who are close to you. Guys don't and won't really ask for space, but they definitely want it. Constantly asking about what he thinks or how he feels about stuff is only going to make him lash out eventually, at which point you will most likely form the wrong opinion about him.  

find a guy whom you're interested in, and would like to understand.  talk to him in various situations.  see how he responds to different conversation topics.  don't pester or consistently nag him.  take the initiative!,  share some of your own thoughts with him.  don't be clingy. 

 While some of the words used to describe web traffic may seem complex, they are actually simple to break down. Understanding how web traffic is tracked and computed will help you keep tabs on your site.    Visits: Simply when someone comes to your site. Each page they go to will register as a visit.  Unique Visitors: A unique IP address that visits the sites. For example, if you go to the same site 10 times in one day, you will get 10 visits but only 1 unique visit.  Time on Site per Page: The amount of time visitors spend on a site or a particular page, regardless of whether or not they do anything. You want this to be high.  Bounce Rate: The percentage of visitors who leave after only reading one page. The lower you can get this, the better.  Exit Rate: The percentage of visits who leave when they are "done." This is only for sites that lead you through a bunch of pages on one theme, like a multiple page article. If they leave after the 3rd page of a 3 page article, they count in your exit rate.; , This will tell you the Alexa traffic rank, traffic rank in the US, and the number of sites linking in. Write down all of these numbers and check back weekly to see how the numbers have changed. Press the "Get Details" button for more detailed information.   Alexa helps you determine which parts of the site get the most views and figure out where your traffic is coming from. Similar to Alexa, there is a program called SearchStatus that can easily track a website's whereabouts. Just install the program and it should begin to process immediately. QuarkBase also works well, but Alexa is the industry standard.  This will give you a very detailed dashboard of who is coming to your site, where they are coming from, how much time they are spending on the site, etc.  There are many available for free download if you search "website hit counter." This will show on your site how many time a particular page has been viewed. You may have to copy and paste the code into your site's HTML code, but this is usually given in step-by-step instructions.   Many website design sites, like Weebly, SquareSpace, and WordPress have built in "apps" in the page customization screen that let you install hit counters.  Tag managers track which articles get the most traction, but only if you tag them. Most blogging and website design sites allow you to add tags, which are relevant words connected to your post. This article, for example, might have the tags, how-to, web traffic, analytics, wiki, etc. A tag manager lets you see what topics get the most traffic.   You can download them for free online.  These numbers mean nothing if you don't have any context for them. Record the numbers regularly and compare them every month to see how the site is growing, where you are most popular, and where you are losing viewers frequently.  

understand how website growth and popularity is tracked.  check the website's stats on alexa.  install google analytics to get accurate information on your website.  install a hit counter.  use a tag manager to see what is most popular.  write down or save your numbers for constant comparison.

 If fiber is affecting your health or making you uncomfortable, it may be ideal to consume less fiber than what's recommended for an average, healthy person.   The total fiber intake recommended for women is: 25 g daily. The total fiber intake recommended for men is: 38 g daily.Keep track of how much fiber you eat throughout the day. You may find it easy to use a food journaling app to help you accurately calculate fiber each day.; , Fiber is found in a wide range of foods including grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes. Limiting the fiber in each meal or snack can help cut down on your overall consumption and may alleviate GI symptoms.Choose lower fiber fruits or remove fibrous parts of fruits. For example: eat applesauce instead of an apple, because the skin of the apple contains a large amount of fiber, or drink six ounces of 100% juice daily. Fruits that are lower in fiber include: canned fruit, cooked fruit, and fruit without the skin or peel. Choose lower fiber vegetables or remove fibrous parts. For example: take the skin off your potato or remove the seeds from your zucchini. Vegetables that are lower in fiber include: canned vegetables, well-cooked and very soft vegetables, vegetables without seeds, and 100% vegetable juice. Choose lower fiber grains. For example: avoid 100% whole grain foods since these are higher in fiber. Choose lower fiber grains like: white rice, white bread, cream of wheat or cream of rice, or plain pasta.  There are two types of fiber — soluble and insoluble. Insoluble fiber is sometimes called "roughage," as it's main function is speed the process of digestion.   Insoluble fiber may stimulate bowls more than desired causing diarrhea in those who are susceptible or have a chronic health condition.Insoluble fiber is found in the following foods: whole grains, vegetables and wheat bran.Soluble fiber absorbs water, makes stools easier to pass and may slow digestion slightly. This type of fiber is more gentle and may be more appropriate for some people.Although insoluble fiber may have negative side effects for some, in general, it's a healthy addition to your diet and can help prevent constipation.  Many food companies now add fiber into different foods to help increase fiber intake.Fiber may be added to foods that typically have little to no fiber and should be avoided by those minimizing fiber in their diets. Examples of foods to limit include:   Orange juice with pulp and added fiber. Artificial sweeteners with added fiber. Yogurts with added fiber. Soy milk with added fiber. Granola bars or bread that have additional added fiber (these may be lower in fiber prior to processing additional added fiber).  There are a variety of fiber supplements that are available to help people increase their fiber intake. However, these should be discontinued immediately if fiber is posing a problem for you or your health.   Discontinue the use of any stool softeners or laxatives that contain added fiber. Do not take oral gummies or fiber capsules. Do not add extra powdered fiber or psyllium husk to foods or beverages.  Writing up a meal plan can help you plan out all the meals and snacks you eat in a day and provide a framework for you to follow throughout the week.   Calculate how much fiber is in each meal or snack and what your total daily intake will be. A meal plan will allow you to change things up, make substitutions or swaps so that you don't go over your target fiber goal each day. Take some of your free time to plan your meals and snacks for one week. Include all meals and snacks you typically eat everyday. Repeat this exercise every week or as needed.  

consume less than the recommended amounts of fiber daily.  minimize fiber in meals and snacks.  limit insoluble fiber.  minimize fiber-fortified foods.  discontinue fiber supplements.  write up a meal plan.

 This could come from either outside your relationship (work, family, financial issues) or from within. If the source of stress is not the relationship itself, don't let stress spoil your private life. Learn how to manage so that it doesn't seep into conversations with your partner.When stress comes from outside the relationship, the best solution is to nip the problem in the bud. For example, if your dissatisfaction with a job is putting strain on your relationship, consider getting a new job instead of letting it affect your well-being.; , If your relationship matters more to you than the source of stress or the fact that you're stressed, then you should focus on your own and your partner's well-being.   Make it clear to your partner that your relationship is still more important than anything else. For example, you can say: "I'm sorry I'm going through a difficult time at work, and that this is putting a strain on us. You know you're what matters the most to me."  , See you and your partner as a team facing a difficult time and looking for a solution together. Put your ego in a corner and think through problems by asking yourself "What can we do?" rather than "What can I do?"If the stress is due to your partner's dealing with a hard situation, sympathize and show your active encouragement. As part of a team, you're called to play the role of helper and comforter.Make it clear that you are committed to the relationship no matter what problem you and your partner are dealing with. Stress tests the strength of any relationship. If you want to stay together despite the hardships, state it clearly., Most relationship problems have their origin in the partners' failure to express their concerns and emotions straightforwardly. The first skill a couple needs as a team is to speak clearly, honestly and respectfully.Don't hold back your feelings. Silence is another source of strain in itself, and will only build up tensions. Express all your concerns and emotions, but do it in a way that is sincere and not judgmental. Go for positive statements like "I'm feeling..." or "I think that...", rather than questions ("Why did you...?") or negative sentences ("I didn't like...").Humor is a great for relieving tension. Making a joke about a difficult situation, or seeing its funny side, will give both of you a positive outlet for your stress and help you put things into perspective. However, make the joke on you or the difficult situation, not on your partner., Money is one of the first causes of stress in a relationship. If debt, unemployment or related issues are putting a strain on your life as a couple, you should be open about it and look for a solution together.   Look for professional financial advise without feeling ashamed. It is an adviser's job to help people through difficult times: you situation is just one of many they've dealt with. Don't blame each other for being in dire straits. Accusing your partner of spending money on a night out instead of saving it for more important stuff will only increase tension. Don't hide anything from your partner and make sure he or she is just as transparent. Discuss honestly how money loss has changed your life and how this is making you feel.  Jobs take up a large part of everyone's life and energy. However, work-related stress can often affect a couple's well-being. This doesn't mean you have to keep it all to yourself. Share it with your partner and find stress-relieving activities together.   Don't ever use your job as a term of comparison with your partner. You might have similar or completely different occupations, but it's never a good idea to measure your professional success or failures against your partner's. Allow yourself and your partner some quality time off work. You can actually cheat on your job, every once in a while, as a sign that what you truly care about is not in your office., Chronic pain or an unexpected disease can put a lot of strain on a relationship. If this happens, remember that illness can change your habits but you're still the same people as before. Deal with the change together, and don't forget that partners are there to help each other especially in this case.   If you're in pain, don't hold back. Let your partner know how this is affecting your life and making you feel. You can't expect your partner to read your mind: express yourself clearly and don't be afraid to ask for help. Keep having sex, if your own or your partner's condition still makes it possible. Being ill doesn't mean you should give up on life as a whole. Make the most of what you can still enjoy!, In stressful times, you might tend to focus on your own problems and feelings. This can make you forget that your partner can help you only if you let him or her speak.   Don't dismiss what they say: think their advice through and show gratitude for the effort. 

isolate the source of stress.  make a priority check.  deal with stress together, not as individuals.  work on your communication skills.  face financial problems together.  remember that work shouldn't take over your relationship.  learn to cope with illness as a couple.  listen. 

 How do you think another person would perceive you right now? Are you slouching and trying to hide away or are you standing up tall and proud? A good time to check out yourself is when you are waiting somewhere, or you are in a meeting. Use this time to "step outside of yourself" and to view how others would be viewing you. Simply imagine what others might be seeing when they're looking at you. Is it a good picture?; , Get a good friend or a family member whom you trust to be objective. Have them tell you how they feel your body posture, facial expressions, and overall demeanor comes across to them. Tell them they are at total liberty to be honest; after all, they see you all the time when you are busy seeing them and others. Most of the time you will find that they do have an opinion; and be sure to take this as constructive criticism, not destructive or mean.  Ask them for advice on how they think that you could better project your image. Try a different way of standing (stand up tall!), or try different facial expressions. Get them to give you feedback on these practice changes as you do them. Remember those that work best so that you can continue working on them.  People often make short remarks about us that we either deflect or resist really taking in because we don't want to change and we don't like thinking that we're being criticized. But some of what people say about improving ourselves is very useful information. If you overhear someone criticizing you, or something gets back to you through someone else, assess this information critically rather than emotionally. If there is a grain of truth to what is being said, you have a ready-made answer to what has to be changed. For example, you might learn that people find you morose, grumpy, irritable, bad-tempered, lazy, etc. and a lot of that will definitely be showing through in your body language. Time to shape up and not react emotionally to these tidbits of feedback!  , Many people now have the ability to film themselves with a camera or a computer. Try it out. Find a passage to read or think of a situation to act out. Film it (or get a trusted friend to film it). Play it back. Consider:   What are your initial reactions? What things about your performance bother you? Please you? Are you cringing at anything? Write a list of the things you'd like to change. For example, muttering, saying "um" a lot, looking defensive, clenching your fists, etc.  It's not a case of trying to be perfect; it's a case of trying to be the best that we can and to bring out the best of our personalities so that other people can see the real us and don't have to dig through the layers of self-defensiveness and poor habits. You are capable of being the real you with just a little extra effort. Once you are aware of your own body language and the signals that it is sending out, you'll be totally amazed with how effective changing the negative body language will be for boosting your self-esteem and attracting people to you. Good luck!  

take a look at yourself in a mirror, a window reflection etc.  find a trusted feedback adviser.  tell your trusted feedback adviser how you wish to come across.  listen to the things people say.  use the resources at hand.  keep practicing and reviewing. 

 After it's installed, it'll most-likely be called SimCity 4 (or SimCity 4 Deluxe) inside the Maxis folder on your Start menu.; , You'll need to get past about four different advertisement title screens to get to begin the game, each time you load the program on your computer. It may take about 30 seconds to load.  At first, you'll see several pre-designed areas; these can be used as a tutorial that you may click through to test out the features of SimCity 4. If you want to select a different region, this may be done from the options at the top of the screen.  Build your city away from the center of the map. Never start your city in the middle of the map as this may lead to complications with boundaries later on in game. Try starting with Industrial Zones in one of the corners of the building zones. One major power conductor and the rest can be for production.  Although Timbuktu - the default region loaded onto SimCity 4 - has some worthwhile areas and can be helpful for training/tutorials, it's not for everyone, so you may wish to pick a new area.  This area looks like part of a globe centered near Europe.  From this menu, you can also delete areas with the "Delete Region" option (but be careful as deleting regions should only be done on personal regions you created to keep to continuity across all platforms from computer-to-computer).  Along with Timbuktu, you also have 5 other regions to load, including a close-to real-life representation of Berlin, Fairview, London, New York and San Francisco - devoid of all buildings though. , Although the region change isn't instantaneous, you'll know that the change has occurred when the area focuses on the center of the new region, and the new region name appears at the bottom left corner of the screen in the region name box, which could take up to a minute later after you select the different region.,,, Click the corresponding radio checkbox. ,, Not all cities need to be terraformed any further to be started. You can still play your city in Mayor mode without terraforming the terrain.   By terraforming, you are essential beginning each game in God mode and won't start real city-building until entering Mayor mode. However, this is a great way to remove unneeded trees (as you'll see later), without paying a single cent out of your Sim-money.  The terraform tool has a tree on it. You can raise, lower or level the terrain here by clicking, holding down and dragging your mouse across the area that needs these actions performed after you select the exact tool you require.   With raising the terrain, you can form mountains, hills, mesas, steep hills and cliffs. Raising it above sea level will create this hills, valleys, mountains and the like.       With lowering the terrain, you can form valleys, steep valleys, canyons, shallow valleys, craters and shallow canyons. Lower it too far, and you'll reach ground water, which will cause a new river or body of water to form.       Leveling will clear away the unneeded trees in the area, but the tool provides large amounts of land space, so don't ask for only a small area to fix. When leveling off the terrain, you can choose between such effects called creating plateaus, softened terrains, quick level brush, create plains and erosions - most of which remove unneeded trees without paying a single penny out of the city coffers.  All these can become impediments to building, so avoid overuse of these two tools; once you start building your city, you won't be able to remove the flora and fauna you've added without spending money.   For fauna, you can set horses, woodland animals and wild animals free in your city.  This Terrain tool which looks like an imaginary cloud blowing into the air. It includes an erode tool, smoothen tool, raise terrain and lower terrain level tool. Clicking the tool then clicking an releasing on map will terraform the area without much pressure applied.  Click the icon that looks like a picture-frame border and click the Accept button to accept the dialog box that results. Reconcile edges when the terrain elevation changes and need to be reset.  You have the power to create disasters as well as to control the day/night cycle of your game (covered later in this article).  Click the icon that looks like a top hat with mayor wand to begin. This button can be found near the bottom left corner of the game screen.  You can either choose to use your real name or a fake mayor name or use the default values for the names of "New City" and "Defacto".  Easy, at first, will be understandable for most, but as you climb through Medium, the difficulty level will get harder (mostly because you'll start off earning less money). With Hard you'll get more money but through Sim-bonds that need to be paid back over time. , Although trees help in real world cases, in SimCity, trees and rubbish are a nuisance and must be bulldozed/demolished. The bulldozer icon is your demolish tool; and much like building click and drag roads or click the icon that represents the building and watch it implode and fade away into oblivion. If it has no trees or rubbish, get used to the placement, as you might need this tool later to demolish a building of some sort when needed.  Although each land is different, you can set up shop next to a river, or on dry land near the cities border, or on the top of a mountain peak; as long as the size is big enough, you can place your first power plant directly there.   Some areas come with their drawbacks, such as having to run a power line down to the areas underneath (such as from the top of a mountain) or near a river (making sure that you aren't touching a river as the game will say that this procedure can't be completed by the red zoned tiles as you move the item around on the waterfront).  Choose the power option from the left siderail of options to begin, and click "Build Power Options." Then select one of the power plant choices. No zones will begin to construct until they have been powered. At first, you'll only have four choices including: wind, natural gas, coal and oil plants. Each have their own pros and cons in terms of pollution and price and amount of power output.   Later, as your population grows, you will get other power plant choices such as solar, nuclear and hydrogen plants. Also, you'll receive other power plant types as you level-up and receive them in your Rewards list too, so watch out for these as well. Later, if you don't have zones sitting next to each other, you'll need to build power lines for these zones. Zones (which will be discussed later) have their own underground imaginary power lines, but must be connected to the power grid via power lines if they are not touching the power plant directly within a one block-zoning distance.  RCI stands for residential, commercial and industrial. It designates how much of each type of the three zones your Sims are requiring you to build (or dezone when the line goes below the neutral zone). Green stands for residential, blue stands for commercial and yellow stands for industrial. This meter will always be displayed, no matter what options you have selected, and can be found to the left of the charts at the bottom of the screen.   As your city wants more of the zone, you'll see the meter's column rise. If your city has too much of a certain zone type, you'll see the zone dip below the center; at this point, just hold off, since your Sims will need them later on (just don't build more if the line dips south). Be careful that you don't have the speed set to pause; otherwise once you've zoned some land and your RCI meter doesn't move, when you unpause it your Sims will be unhappy because you've zoned way, way too much or you will be out of your Sim mayorship job early. This meter is an integral part of your gameplay and should be monitored very often.  You'll find this near the bottom center of your screen. It will give you a general idea how much money you have available to be able to purchase items for zoning (RCI) and placing (such as police, fire, etc.) later.  Once you place a power plant, your zones tool will open. You can also open the zoning tool manually by clicking the tool that looks like a bunch of colored boxes inside an oval. Select the green tool, select the density level (discussed later), click and drag to place the item, and release to begin the build of these zones. Residential zones are where your Sims will live.  Your commercial zones are where your Sims will shop, and are colored blue when they are unbuilt but are zoned.  These zones are where your Sims have jobs (SimCity doesn't call these places by the generic term "work" but if you want on the outside, you can call it that), and are colored yellow when they are unbuilt but are zoned.   As you'll learn later, there are three main densities of industrial zone. However, with industrial, Maxis/EA Games replaced the term "low-density industrial" with the term "agricultural industrial," which has its own zone limitations in terms of maximum block zoning sizes. Generally, this kind of zone requires several blocks next to each other to begin.  There are three densities including low, medium and high density. Although each will bring in more money and population, as the density gets higher, your cost to build them will also increase and thereby decrease more of your Sim-spending cash per tile.  If you accidentally zoned a piece of land that shouldn't have been zoned, you can dezone the area using the dezone tool that is specifically set for that type of zone.   You can't use the industrial dezone tool to dezone a commercial zone, you can't dezone a commercial zone using a residential dezone, but you can use a industrial dezone to dezone a industrial zone, etc. (It's a 1-to-1 relationship of types of zones to their dezone tool.) In SimCity 4,the fees to dezone these zoning tiles costs a lot less than in real life. However, if construction has already started on the zone, you can't use a dezone tool; it has to be bulldozed instead (which can cost Sim money). If you dezone or bulldoze a zone later in the game, you'll need to know what direction your zones are heading to ensure your Sims don't complain that they aren't being blocked off from the different transportation routes.  Your transportation tool is set into several subtypes which have several selections to choose from. On top of streets and roads, you also have highways, and avenues, bus stations, rail stations, subways and lots of other transportation elements that will get your Sims from place-to-place, all while trying to avoid traffic congestion.   Sometimes when zoning an area, zones will create the lowest level of transportation from the transportation options given to you: the street. While you may build roads where streets were once used (you can build right on top of the existing street without bulldozing) and add other transportation elements, you'll need to spend more money to replace and keep up with your roads. Roads (which look like a two-lane roadway) have several selections you can choose from, including roads, one-way roads, avenues (toll booths can be placed later on these road types thereby increasing your funds available by a little), and streets (road-type placed within RCI zones occasionally).       Highways and ramps (cloverleaf onramp icon) can consist of ground level highways, elevated highways, ground highway cloverleaves, elevated highway cloverleaves, ground highway t-intersection, elevated highway t-intersection, ground highway overpass-onramp, elevated highway overpass onramp, ground highway side onramp, and elevated highway side onramp.       Due to this list being so diverse, there are more icons that exist off the initial page of icons. To get to these, you'll need to click the down arrow to get to the remainder of the icons, one icon at a time.   Rails and depots (which have an icon that looks like the front of a steam locomotive) include rails, passenger train stations, freight train stations, grand railroad stations, monorail and monorail stations.       The miscellaneous transportation options consist of bus stops, elevated rail, elevated rail station, subway-to-elevated transition, subway, subway station, public parking garage and toll booths.       Airports (which look like a jet-airline icon) can consist of small landing strips, small municipal airports and small international airports. In SimCity 4, these are no longer their own zonable areas consisting of red zones but are now their own bulldozable areas. Both airports and seaports reflect the industrial line of your RCI meter when they have been built.       Water transportation methods (ferry boat at a dock icon) include passenger ferry terminals, car and passenger ferry terminals, seaports and a marina. Both airports and seaports reflect the industrial line of your RCI meter when they have been built. Though seaport zones are trickier to initially place, they can built.       Although once easy to construct, bridges over water can be built, but only using the Roads tool (unlike the common Streets your zones will initially put out.  Watch your maps for crime, fire and health care. Your civic tools tool looks like a mayor house/capitol building and has several options and sub-options of these including options of: police, fire, education, hospitals and health, landmarks, rewards and parks.   Police (which look like a police badge icon) consist of police kiosks, small police stations, large police station, deluxe police stations and city jails.       Fire (fireman's hat icon) consist of small fire station, large fire station, and fire department landing strips.       Educational systems (which look like a graduation cap and diploma icon) include elementary school, large elementary school, local branch library, high school, large high school, city museums, city college, university, major art museum and a main library.       Due to this list being so diverse, there are more icons that exist off the initial page of icons. To get to these, you'll need to click the down arrow to get to the remainder of the icons, one icon at a time.   Hospitals and clinics (which look like a body helix icon) include medical clinic, large medical center, and a disease research center.       Landmarks are so diverse, they can't all be displayed here. Look through the pages-upon-pages of icons to display what choices are available to you. Landmarks are only decorative pieces that can increase tourism - and thereby some population - but can bring a mixed bag of results as to your residential and commercial zones in the RCI meter.       Due to this list being so diverse, there are more icons that exist off the initial page of icons. To get to these, you'll need to click the down arrow to get to the remainder of the icons, one icon at a time.   Rewards will sometimes be displayed in the Rewards menu as you level up. But to ensure you don't look to quantity over quality, these won't be discussed here. It will start with a Mayor's House as the first reward earned, but will escalate from there.       Due to this list being so diverse, there are more icons that exist off the initial page of icons. To get to these, you'll need to click the down arrow to get to the remainder of the icons, one icon at a time.   Parks (which look like trees and bench icon) include open paved areas, open grass areas, small park greens, community gardens (4 different designs each costing the same price), beach, small flower gardens, basketball court, playground, gazebo, ranger station, small plaza, tennis court, medium park green, medium flower garden, medium playground, skateboard park, medium plaza, large flower garden, large park green, soccer field, softball field, large plaza, marina (different than the marina in water transport), farmers market (city needs to include some agricultural population and agricultural zones, minor league stadium, opera house, tourist trap, city zoo and a major league stadium.       Due to this list being so diverse, there are more icons that exist off the initial page of icons. To get to these, you'll need to click the down arrow to get to the remainder of the icons, one icon at a time.  Your choices can be found within the Utilities tool with an icon that looks like the top of a water tower. You'll have to hook up the pipes into a water tower and water pump. You can also include a water treatment plant and (when your population grows large enough) into a large water pump.   Always start with a small water tower, which should be enough to fill your city with water to all the tiles on the map. However, split this water line out to all other areas of the map, by clicking the Water Pipes and draw pipes (using a click and drag), out from the water tower out so the area in question can be full of a bluish color water icon. Return to the above-ground map, by clicking another icon from any of the other services in Mayor mode from the left hand side of the screen.  You can include landfill zones (zoned in brown though it doesn't make the RCI meter), recycling centers, and waste-to-energy plants. For this, you'll have it's own dezone tool.  The feedback bar will help give you a general idea of how well your mayorship is performing for you. This gives you a general idea of how well you are managing their needs.To include this image to your article, simply copy and paste the following wikitext:, You'll also be able to see what other things you can obtain as they come on the market.  You should be able to see your City Opinion Poll area-chart open before you even begin looking at building your city.   Understand that just to the right of most of these charts, you'll find a upward pointing arrow. This arrow will allow you to customize your city even more than the initial view. This arrow is especially useful when it comes to needing to customize the look of your buildings as well as reading and customizing your budget (as you'll learn about later).  You'll need to expand this area of your charts after selecting the icon that looks like a power line and a line chart; this setting will allow the game to automatically change the look of your buildings (within your Residential, Commercial and Industrial zones) every 5 SimYears or so, or keep it on one single style upon the build year. You have these choices:   Chicago 1890 New York 1940 Houston 1990 Euro-Contemporary (not checked by default upon first load).  Once you check an item, a colored overlay on the map will show (the hue and color of colors will differ dependent on which view you pick). You can choose one of sixteen views to see how your Sims feel you are doing. There are many you can choose from including: fire hazards, crime, education, water, power and lots of great data among the many others. This sheet has an icon that looks like a scattered plot chart.  You can choose to view your outlook with your city planner, finance advisor, utilities advisor, public safety advisor, health and education advisor, transportation advisor or environmental advisor. These advisors might sometimes tell you nothing more than what's already been said in the scrolling news-bar headlines (which can be clicked to grab slightly extended stories). Look for the icon that looks like a person's face-to-chest profile.  Although these graphs have more extended amounts of data than Data View (as you learned above), this graph doesn't help as much to show you how each individual citizen thinks you stack up on potential issues. You can find this icon that looks like a line chart to begin.  Click the swirly icon near the center of the screen and click the "up" arrow to view. Click the item's options and adjust by moving sliders as you see fit.  All cities open with this chart open as a default option, but if they were changed to view the budget info, you may have to change this info back. If you find this info never changing and you are expecting an imminent reward or level change, you may want to see what's holding things up.  Select the "..." to open your list of menu options. Another bar will float onto the screen to the right of this "..." button.   Save your game progress every few hours of creating the city or until you need to take a break. Open the menu and click the "floppy disc icon" - Click OK to the box that displays saying your city has been saved.  Although exiting the simulation is triggered to know just how far you want to leave, you don't have too many options. The next two options you'll have in the list is to "Exit to Region" or to "Quit" the program entirely.  

install and launch an official copy of simcity 4.  watch the videos and advertisement or click past them.  click an area from the region map.  decide on whether or not the region you are given has any worthwhile areas to start building your city.  click on the "region view options" button from the top area.  decide whether you want to load a different region, or to create a region.  find a region to load from the list.  click the "load region" button to change the region.  ,  wait a few seconds for the new region to load.  pick the create region button to begin.  ,  type a new region name into the box.  ,  determine the type of terrain your region will mostly be - plains or very watery.  click the create region button to begin the new region.  ,  click on an area of the region to begin.  ,  determine whether or not you need to terraform the landscape of your "city to-be".  research and try each of the effects in the terraform bar on the left side of the screen.  seed forests (add trees/looks like a duplicate tree icon) with the terraform tool or place some fauna (looks like a sheep's side-view profile icon) on the terrain.  look into using some of the one-click global terrain effects.  reconcile edges when the terrain needs it or changes have been made to the very edges of the map.  learn about other things that can happen when you are terraforming in god mode.  begin the game in mayor mode now.  give your city its own name, and pick your name as mayor, too.  choose a difficulty level.  click the establish city button to begin.  ,  demolish trees and rubbish as you see fit.  locate a suitable place to set up your city.  build a power plant from the utilities tool.  watch your city's rci meter.  watch your sim money in the game.  build residential zones away from industrial zones, but close to commercial zones.  build commercial zones close to residential zones, but also make them be built away from industrial zones by several blocks.  build industrial zones near polluter power plants and away from residential areas as best as possible.  recognize that zones have three different densities when you click either of the three main zone types.  recognize how to fix any mistakes in zoning.  build roads and infrastructure elements (transportation elements) with the transportation tool.  build some civic tools only as your population requests them.  give your sims some chances of being able to drink water.  look into zoning for landfill areas from the utilities menu (which looks like a filled garbage can icon).  watch your feedback from your sims grow.  watch the scrolling news-bar to find out what is happening in your town.  find the charts area directly to the right of your rci meter.  control your city's building styles in the building style control center.  read about charts and certain data in your city in the data views sheet.  consult with your simadvisors with the advisor charts button.  read the graphs about your city.  adjust your budget levels to raise income for your city or decrease the income and tax percents to obtain more population to your city.  read the city opinion polls about the status of your citizens when it comes to environment, health, safety, traffic, education and land value.  save your game if you'd like to.  exit the simulation. 

 Individuals with a history of being physically or emotionally abused, especially as children, are more prone to suffer from IED, as are those suffering from a personality disorder or other serious mental illnesses. IED may also be linked with repeated traumatic experiences of violence or stress, such as the traumas experienced by active-duty military personnel.Other mental illnesses are sometimes linked to IED include personality disorders, such as antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and disorders associated with disruptive behavior, such as attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder. Just because an individual displays one or more of these risk factors does not mean they suffer from IED. However, the presence of risk factors in addition to the characteristic symptoms of IED, explosive episodes of rage, should be cause for concern.  Everyone finds themselves feeling or expressing anger from time to time, and it's perfectly healthy to do so. Rage, on the other hand, is a destructive emotion that can cause us to act in ways we normally would never think to. While anger may influence the way we behave while experiencing it, rage seems to utterly command our behavior and thought, leaving no room for anything else., Explosive episodes seem to come out of nowhere. An IED sufferer may find themselves in a steady, or even pleasant mood, conducting their daily business when, without warning, they find themselves overwhelmingly angry, displaying uncontrollable, violent behavior.While explosive episodes are most likely to occur in private, often after dark, their unpredictable nature means that they may sometimes occur in places where loud or highly visible expressions of anger are inappropriate, such as at work or in public places.  Sufferers of IED often become extremely violent, or even abusive, during their explosive episodes. Seemingly tiny arguments or frustrations can lead, in the blink of an eye, to extraordinary and uncharacteristic displays of physical and emotional cruelty. These displays are usually very sudden in their onset, making them unpredictable and dangerous for everyone involved.Common examples of violent behaviors linked to IED include:   Shouting or screaming, even though the person being spoken to is not raising their voice. Invading personal space, often by stepping close and getting "in the face" of those nearby. Throwing, hitting, or breaking objects. Shoving, grabbing, or hitting others. Intentionally hurting oneself, such as by slapping or punching, beating one's head against a wall, etc. Name-calling, or use of language intended to hurt or insult others. Threatening others with violence. While the specific behaviors displayed by an IED sufferer during an explosive episode may vary, they are always characterized by being disproportionate, or "way over the top", relative to the circumstances or events triggering the episode.  A true explosive episode can last for several hours before it dissipates naturally. After an extended episode of rage, the sufferer is likely to feel exhausted, and relieved that the episode has ended. Later, the sufferer may feel intense remorse, shame, and unease while thinking about the things they said and did while experiencing their explosive episode. These feelings can lead the sufferer to become depressed, irritable and removedAn IED sufferer will also often experience much shorter episodes, during which they might momentarily "snap" at someone in conversation, becoming suddenly verbally or physically hostile before returning to normal. Episodes occur irregularly, with gaps of days, weeks or even months in between.  Only a medical expert can diagnose someone with IED, or any other mental illness. Your first step, if you suspect that you or someone you know is suffering from IED, should be to consult with a psychiatrist, councilor or medical doctor about the symptoms and risk factors which are bothering you. Once any anger issues have been diagnosed, you and your doctor can begin exploring options for treatment.  

identify ied risk factors.  learn to differentiate rage from normal anger.  recognize episodes of abrupt, unexpected anger.  judge the extremity and violence of any anger-related behavior.  determine the length and after effects of episodes of anger.  seek the assistance of a mental health professional. 

 Using an emulator is the easiest way to use cheats in Pokémon LeafGreen. If you want to cheat using your actual Game Boy, you'll need to purchase a Gameshark or Action Replay.; , This Rare Candy code will replace the first slot in your PC item storage with 999 Rare Candies.

 One foot (about 30.5 cm)is recommended for beginners. ; ,, This will be the length of your stilt poles.  Be cautious to cut the ends so at least one end on each pole (the bottom) is flat, as this will be the surface on which you will be walking.  A good size is usually 4”-6”. Again, insure that at least one side on each piece is flat, as this side will line up with the long stilt poles. , You will want to measure to make sure you are nailing these pieces in at the right height. From the bottom of the stilt poles, measure the height you want to gain (from #1) and subtract 2”. This will be where you nail in the top of the triangle, so that one of the 4” surfaces is perpendicular to the stilt pole and the other is parallel to the stilt pole. Two nails should be used to secure each triangle. Hammer one nail in through the bottom of the triangle (1” from the bottom) through the stilt pole first. Hammer the other about 1” above that through the triangle first.  The foothold should fit nicely on top of the triangle. Make sure the flat side of the foothold is next to the stilt pole. To fix the foothold into place, nail the footholds into both the 2”x2” stilt pole and the foothold supports. Three nails should be hammered in through the top of the foothold, at a 45 degree angle to the foothold, through the support and stilt pole. ,, You can now try to walk on your stilts! Happy walking!  

determine how much height you would like to gain on your stilts.  in the standing position, have someone measure the distance from the bottom of your foot to your elbow.  ,  add the measurements from #1 and #2 together.  make the stilt poles: cut the 2”x2” board into two pieces which are each the length determined in #3.  make the footholds: cut another 2”x2” piece to a length that exceeds the width of your foot by 1”.  make the foothold supports: cut the 2”x4”x4” board into triangles such that two sides of each triangle are 4” long (the hypotenuse is therefore longer than 4”).  ,  nail these triangle footholds into the 2”x2” stilt poles.  take the footholds and place each perpendicular to the stilt pole on top of the triangle foothold support for each stilt.  if any of the nails are too long, hammer them so that the point faces downward, so as to avoid injury if you fall off the stilts.  ,  sand down any rough spots on the top of the boards or on the hand holds to make the stilts more comfortable to grip.  ,  voila! 

 It's easier said than done, but it's the prerequisite to gain any sort of spiritual enlightenment. Until your environment has lies, you aren't heading anywhere near to God. Begin by identifying all previous lies/half lies/half truths you have said or displayed, and rectify them quickly since they might lead to lie further lies and half-truths. Become fearless to the consequences of telling plain, bitter, truths in an untwisted manner. Once speaking the truth becomes a habit, it is much easier.; , Your knowledge, your wisdom, your intelligence, your wit, your body, your education, your nationality, your wealth are all gifts of God to you. You don't own it, and inevitably, will lose it one day or the next (you'll die, won't you?).  It makes all the difference between good and bad people. Care for little things of whether people around you are comfortable, or hungry, or whether your friends have done the homework, etc. Don't ever be happy at someone's failure or misfortune, even if (s)he is your adversary.  Ever since we were born, we have been indebted to many people. Our parents took care of us when we were capable of nothing. you can read this article because your teacher taught you abecedary. It's time to pay them back with your love, care and generosity.  Deals and promises aren't cheap terms. They rest on the prime foundation on which human civilization rests: trust. The character of a just man is that always is true to his word.  Use the kindest and the most understanding words you know. Pay attention on the tone and volume and keep the voice level even and controlled. Though situations can be annoying, maintain restraint. It is a true that a raised temper hasn't solved many problems.  Religious talk tends to have a reverse effect on ones spirituality. One might practice a religion personally, but discussing it surely creates ill-will and distance from God.  Generosity is one of the great attributes of God we all identify well with. We like generous people. Generous people are admired for their spirit of self-sacrifice. God loves generous people. Keep in mind that everything with you belongs to God, and your generosity is a result of your indebtedness and thanks., It helps keep the mind clear of the things that take you away from God. Being clean will remove laziness and procrastination of any thing you must do. It is said "an idle mind is the devil's workshop"!  , These are the people through whom God shapes your life.  After all that God has done for you in the past, and for all you have become, reciprocate and offer sincere thanks. Remember: You have no closer relationship, no relationship more intimate, than the relationship between you and God.  

stick to the truth.  eliminate your ego.  care for and about all things.  clear your debts.  keep your word.  speak and act with kindness.  don't speak about religion.  be overly generous.  maintain hygiene.  love your family, friends, colleagues and everyone else.  pray daily. 

 You can use any mix of deliciousness that may appeal to you. Red potatoes, carrots, rutabaga, onions, and beef hamburger make a great mix.   Other options may be; the breakfast pasty with scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon, and hamburger; the pizza pasty with pepperoni, sausage, cheese, and pizza sauce.; , The rutabaga will be difficult to cut if you don't use a heavy knife with a sturdy blade. You may peel the potatoes if you prefer, but it doesn't hurt to leave them unpeeled.  You may prefer your pasties unseasoned, but salt, pepper, hot sauce, garlic, or almost any other seasoning is an option.   Quantities kind of matter at this point, but everything depends on what you have available, and what you like. Generally, this recipe will make more than enough filling for 6 medium pasties.  Mix it with your hands, kind of like playing with play-dough. Only it is meat. And vegetables. , You will need 3 cups of white flour, 1 cup of lard or shortening, and water. Mix the lard with the flour until it reaches a crumbly consistency. Add water until the dough is workable, but doesn't stick to your hands. Add flour as necessary to achieve this state.  It's time to put these puppies together!  , You'll want to have a relatively circular formation about 10 inches (25.4 cm) across, and about the thickness of a thin pizza crust, or the fabric of a standard t-shirt.  Place it in the middle of your dough, more or less in the shape of a ball.  Squeeze/crimp them together at the top and along the sides.   If you have excess dough, be sure to cut it off and reuse it. If you didn't use enough to enclose your filling...well that's ok, just use a little more next time.  This will prevent even distribution of your precious pasties on the inner surface of your oven. ,, Keep your eye on them, and when they are golden brown, select one to slice in half to check the doneness of the meat. 

select filling ingredients.  dice the vegetables to about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm), or about the size of the nail on your pinky finger.  add seasonings at your discretion.  place all the filling ingredients, including the thawed hamburger, in a bowl.  place your amalgamated filling in the refrigerator while you perform this next step of crust creation.  ,  make the dough.  spread a thin layer of flour on a clean surface, to prevent a mildly frustrating adhesive effect.  roll the dough out.  grab a fistful of your filling (about a cup).  fold the edges of the crust up and over the ball.  poke holes on top of each one with a fork, or score with a knife.  keep churning those pasties out until you run out of ingredients or oven space!  ,  place your pasties of perfection on your cookie sheet.  ,  put them in the preheated oven for about 1 hour.  eat this sampler with care, because it is hot and you are a ravenous pasty eater.  

 Keep your dog on the same feeding schedule for the first few days. He probably ate once or twice a day at the shelter. Maintaining the schedule will keep your dog from getting diarrhea due to a new regimen. If he was only eating once a day, you can begin to transition him to eating twice a day. Divide his meal into two and give him the majority of his food during his first meal. Gradually increase the amount of food he gets at the second meal until he is eating twice a day.Allow your dog 10 minutes to eat and then get rid of any leftovers. This will keep you from overfeeding him. If possible, feed him the same food he was given at the shelter and slowly transition into the food of your choice. If your dog was living in shelter, he may have had to fight to make sure he got something to eat. This can result in him being territorial about food. If you notice that your dog is barking or lunging when you get too close to his food, feed him in a crate or a bathroom. Eventually your dog will learn that he does not need to guard his food., Take your dog outside to use the bathroom first thing in the morning, one hour after a meal, as soon as you get home from work, and right before bedtime. Praise your dog when he uses the bathroom. If your dog has an accidents or pees in the wrong place, do not punish him. This will only teach him to fear you.If you will not be around to take your dog to the bathroom, keep him in his crate. Dogs will usually not use the bathroom in their home. Try to take your dog to the bathroom at the same times each day. This will help him develop a routine and feel secure.  Your dog will need to have at least one exercise session each day, but the amount and duration of exercise will depend on his individual needs. Pay attention to your dog’s preferences as well. Some dogs may be happy with a walk while other dogs may want more intense activities like running or playing fetch.If your dog is breathing heavily and no longer wants to participate in the activity you are doing, it is time to end the exercise session. For example, if you were playing with a stick and he no longer wants to bring the stick back, take a break.  Your dog should visit a veterinarian within the first week that you bring him home. Your vet will do a general checkup, discuss preventive health care, and determine any special needs that your dog may have. Try to have the visit scheduled before you bring your dog home. Consider buying pet insurance to help with the costs of care.  

feed him twice a day.  potty train your dog.  exercise regularly.  establish care with a veterinarian. 

 When you choose not to include a subject line, you’re not taking advantage of the opportunity it provides to draw in your reader. Having a blank subject line will also make you look lazy. Most importantly, it certainly won’t make your reader feel like they need to open or respond to your email quickly., Your subject line may feel like an afterthought that’s not as important as the actual content of your email. Since it’s the first thing your reader sees, however, it’s just as critical - if not more so! - as what’s inside. To make sure you dedicate enough time and attention to your subject line, write it before you write anything else., Unless you’re sending off a quick note to someone you know well, you should treat your emails like formal communications. Capitalize your subject lines in the same way you would capitalize the titles of your presentations.Remember a few basic rules to help you capitalize correctly. For example, always capitalize the first and last words of your subject lines. You should also always capitalize nouns (Mountain, Presentation, Building), pronouns (He, She, They), verbs (Go, Change), adverbs (Quickly, Slowly), and adjectives (Sloppy, Excellent). You should not capitalize articles (a, an, the), prepositions (in, out), or coordinating conjunctions (and, but)., While your subject lines should be grammatically correct, view them as titles rather than sentences that always need punctuation. Your subject lines don’t need to be capped with a period, question mark, or exclamation mark.   Be aware that some spam filters will automatically slate emails with punctuated subject lines to the junk mail filter. You may occasionally want to use a question mark to grab your reader’s attention. Don’t overuse this strategy. Connect multiple phrases in subject lines with dashes. For example, the subject line: “Scheduled Meeting for Tuesday - Your Attendance Required,” contains two distinct phrases connected with a dash.  Your subject lines should be as brief as possible. This may occasionally require you to leave out some details in favor of others. It’s most important that your reader know what they need to do by when as soon as they read your subject line.It may not always be possible to keep your subject lines at or under 50 characters. Sometimes, you’ll go ten or so characters over. If you start to shoot for the 50-character rule, however, you’ll automatically begin writing shorter subject lines.  What these words are will differ depending on the purpose of your email. Your name and title might need to come first in some emails, while the action required by you or the reader may be up front in others. Think about what will make your reader most likely to open your email, and put the words that correspond to that topic at the very beginning of the subject line.Generally, you should start your subject line off with a word that indicates why you’re contacting your reader. If you’ve recently changed office regulations, for example, write: “Changed Company Regulations - Needs Your Review Today.”  , Don’t include vague or unclear nouns and verbs in your subject line. Instead, use words that specifically indicate exactly what you want from your reader. This will cut down on the length of your subject line while still providing the details you need in your subject line.Instead of: “Contacting you to check out new info,” write: “Revised HR Rules - Needs Approval by Wed.” In the second version of the subject line, you’ve clarified exactly what the “new info” is, and why you’re contacting the reader. You’ve corrected any confusion as to whether the recipient needs to read the email and what they need to do once they open it.  Tell the reader why you’re contacting them. Be as specific as possible. This will help the reader know right away whether they should open your message.A subject line asking for a letter of recommendation or reference could look like: “Requesting Reference for Tamara G. by Friday 6/2.” If you’re offering your reader a benefit, try something like: “Change Your Oil at Jim’s 50% Off This Week Only.”, As soon as they see your email, your reader will want to know what they need to do. Having this knowledge immediately will prepare your reader to look for further details within the content of your note.Instead of writing, “Reaching Out for a Favor,” make your subject line: “Need Your Help Writing Project Proposal Next Week.” This lets the reader know not only that you’re asking for help, but also explains exactly what you hope the reader will do for you.  If you don’t let the reader know when you need them to take action or respond, they may not open your email until tomorrow, next week, or even next month. This isn’t because your reader doesn’t want to help you. Most people receive tens or even hundreds of emails per day, so emails without clear deadlines are easily lost in the herd.If your email is especially important and needs immediate reply, you can use the words “Urgent,” “Critical,” or “Immediate Response Needed” to let your reader know that they should pay particular attention to this note.  Sometimes, you’ll email people you’ve never met before. In these cases, it may be important for you to provide your reader with your title, company, or name so they have a reason to open your note. Otherwise, you may appear to be just a random person whose email can go straight to the trash!Maybe you’re a student getting in touch with a local politician for a school project. Write: “High School Senior Requesting Interview for Project, Due 6/24.”  , You may be getting in touch with this person because you’ve just met and are hoping to develop a closer relationship with them. Jog their memory in the subject line so they remember meeting you. They’ll be more likely to set up a follow-up if they recall your previous encounter.Perhaps you had a brief discussion at a conference or dinner about some of your mutual interests. Make your subject line: “Following Up on our Chat at Writers’ Conf, 4/30.”  , If someone else put you in touch with your recipient, it’s important that you clarify that fact. Your reader will be much more likely to open an email with a subject line that includes the name of someone they know, rather than an anonymous person they’ve never met. Your reader may also choose to reach out to your mutual contact to confirm the introduction.For example, write, “Dr. Smith’s Student @ Hopkins, Requesting Meeting Next Month.”  , You don’t want your reader to have trouble understanding your subject line. Avoid using overly long words and complex vocabulary. Pretend you’re sending your email to a middle schooler, and ask yourself whether they could understand each word in the subject line.Avoid using obscure vocabulary when a simpler word will do. Choose: “New Office Rules - Review and Respond Quickly,” instead of “New Office Rules - Review and Respond with Alacrity.” “Quickly” and “with alacrity” mean the same thing, but the first option is less off-putting and confusing.  Many words can be shortened without leaving the reader confused. Use only common abbreviations and symbols, and read over your subject line to ensure there won’t be any confusion about your email’s purpose.   For example, days of the week can all be shortened. “@” is a common symbol for “at.” You can also use “RE:” to mean “about.” “EOM” may be used for “end of message,” and “EOD” may stand in for “end of day.”  , Just like any other part of your email, your subject line needs to be free of errors. This will ensure that you don’t look unprofessional or lazy right off the bat, before your reader even has a chance to open your note.   Email spell-checkers may not cover the subject lines, so be especially careful with spelling mistakes. If you’re worried, copy and paste the subject line into a Word or Google doc and run spellcheck there. Your subject line may not need to be a complete sentence. However, avoid common grammatical errors such as confusing “they’re,” “their,” and “there” or “you’re” and “your.”  , The best way to ensure that your subject lines are simple, concise, and correctly written is to read them out loud to yourself. When you hear your words spoken, you’ll catch mistakes you wouldn’t if you had just checked them over on the screen.   If you’re in a public place, read the words softly under your breath.  

avoid leaving the subject line blank.  write your subject line before you write your email.  follow standard capitalization rules to avoid sloppiness.  avoid treating your subject lines like complete sentences.  keep your subject lines under about 50 characters.  put important words first to grab the reader’s attention.  choose specific nouns and verbs to communicate the email’s purpose.  specify the purpose of your email.  write what action you want your reader to take.  provide a deadline so the reader knows when to respond.  state who you are if the reader doesn’t already know you.  mention meeting the reader if they’re a recent acquaintance.  name your mutual contact if you’re being introduced to the reader.  use simple language to avoid confusion.  use symbols and abbreviations to shorten subject lines.  check for spelling and grammatical mistakes.  read your subject lines out loud to check for clarity. 

 Get pricing for the metals you have and ask how long each scrap yard will honor the prices. Be specific about the amount of each type of metal you have so you can accurately shop around.iScrap is an app and online directory where you can find the nearest scrap yards and their information. Some scrap yards offer pick-up service at a cost. Ask ahead of time how much it will cost to have the materials collected as well as how much the materials are worth.  Start by separating out ferrous from non-ferrous metals. Depending on the amount of metal you have, you can also sort out stainless steel, copper, aluminum, lead, brass and bronze.You cannot have other recyclable materials with your metals if you’re going to a scrap yard. Having paper, cardboard, wood, plastic or glass in your pile may result in the entire pile being rejected.  Copper or aluminum insulated wiring doesn’t have to be stripped, but doing so will make you double or triple the amount of money if you’re taking it to a scrap yard. Purchase a wire stripper to get the job done.Wire strippers can cost anywhere from $10 to more than $100. If you have a small bundle of wire to strip, a less expensive tool should suffice, but if you have a large load a more sophisticated tool will help.  

call multiple nearby scrap yards.  sort out your metals.  recycle wiring.

 Millet seeds or "sprays" containing seeds are often sold as bird food, but these come in many varieties and may not be reliably labeled. While bird owners have reported success planting these seeds, or even growing them accidentally by dropping them in the garden, seeds or young plants purchased from a plant nursery will most likely be labeled with an exact species. This gives you a better idea of what to expect, and may help you find more specific answers to problems you encounter while growing.   "Ornamental millet" varieties such as Purple Majesty or Foxtail Millet Highlander are recommended for small garden plots due to their attractive appearance. They still produce edible seeds that will attract birds and other wildlife.Some millet varieties, such as Golden Millet, grow to 18–24 inches (46–61 cm) in height, while other common varieties require more space and reach 5 feet (1.5 m) or more in height.Your millet plant may not reach its maximum height in cool climates.If you plan on eating the millet or feeding it to birds, use organic millet seeds and do not treat the plant with pesticides.; , For best results, especially with ornamental millet, start the seeds indoors approximately 6–8 weeks before the last frost of the year.Alternatively start the seeds directly outdoors as long as the frost is over and soil temperatures are above 50ºF (10ºC), but be aware that this may not give the plant time to mature and produce seeds by the end of the growing season., You can purchase seed starting soil, or mix ordinary potting soil with an equal amount of compost.Using soil from your garden may not be as effective, but you can attempt to grow millet in any soil that drains quickly. Mix perlite or sand into the soil if the soil clumps together or tends to stay soggy after watering.  Seeds should not be buried deep, but instead placed no more than 1/4 inch (6mm) below the surface.Ideally, plant the seeds 2–3 inches (5–7.5 cm) apart. If you don't have enough space, you may plant them closer together and thin out the smallest seedlings once the seeds have sprouted.  The seedlings should sprout within a few days. Many millet varieties are adapted to warm climates, and grow best if exposed to bright, indirect sunlight for most of the day and temperatures around 78ºF (25ºC).If the millet you purchased came with other instructions, follow them instead.  Water the seeds immediately after planting to help them sprout and grow.Subsequently, water whenever the soil is dry or nearly dry, but not if it still feels damp. Make sure the water drains well. Millet will not grow well if the seeds are soaking in water.  After the last frost has passed and the soil temperatures are above 50ºF (10ºC), dig the seedlings out individually, taking care to keep their roots intact. Transplant them into outdoor pots or directly into the garden, using the same soil they were in before. Try to plant the seedlings to the same depth they were before, not burying stem that was previously above the soil level. Keep the millet in full sun unless it shows signs of withering or burning.   The recommended size of the pot or spacing of the plants varies greatly with the type of millet. If the weather is hot or the seedlings are still small, consider keeping them in an outdoor area with partial shade and wind protection for one or two weeks before moving them to an area of full sun. This allows them to gradually adjust to outdoor conditions.  Because there are thousands of millet species and varieties, it is impractical to give specific instructions for each. Generally speaking, millet plants enjoy good-draining soil and do best if the soil is not allowed to dry out completely.Millet is unlikely to survive freezing temperatures either as seeds or adult plants, and most types thrive in warm weather.If your millet appears unhealthy or some of the plants die, have a botanist or garden nursery employee identify your species of millet and suggest specific care.   If your millet rots or looks slimy at the base or roots, reduce watering. If your millet dries out or falls over, it may be a short-root variety. Add compost to the soil to help trap moisture and provide a sturdier support for the plants.  If you wish to collect seeds to feed to house pets, or to plant again next year, you'll need to get to them before birds and other wildlife. The time it takes for millet to mature varies greatly with variety and climate, so once the plants flower, keep an eye out for seed pods. These pods grow among the fluffy ends of the plant, and eventually open up to release seeds. Periodically break open a pod to see if the seeds inside are brown or black. If they are, the pods are ready for collecting. Gather them individually, or simply cut off the whole stalk.Note that millet is an annual crop, meaning the plant will die after producing seeds.  Seed pods can be left in a paper bag to dry for one or two weeks. Shake the bag to separate seeds from the other material (chaff), then store in a dark, dry place to plant next year. Alternatively, feed fresh or dry seeds to pet birds in small quantities as treats. If you have enough millet seeds, you can boil them into a porridge.   Together, millets and other treats should not make up more than 10% of your bird's diet. 

choose a millet variety.  plant seeds indoors in early spring, or outdoors in late spring.  prepare the soil.  place seeds below a thin layer of soil.  keep the seeds in a warm space with indirect light.  know when to water the seeds.  transplant the seedlings to areas of full sun once the weather warms.  adjust care as needed.  harvest seeds just before they ripen.  learn how to use the seeds. 

 What are the popular games? What are the current trends in new games? What ideas and concepts have been used before? Exploring the market of existing games will help you become familiar with the style codes your game should conform to, and it can also help you identify holes in the market - holes that your game can fill.; , Be open to new experiences and ideas. Be original and creative, and avoid making your game too much like any existing ones. You can use ideas from other games, but make sure to introduce new concepts and ideas into your own.  To come up with an idea, think about what you want in an adventure, what kind of adventure you would like to have. It could be under the sea with marine animals, or up in the space with aliens - the possibilities are endless. Come up with a storyline for the game, have a few goals the player is trying to accomplish. Add details that will help develop your fantasy world, like currency, language, and other characters.  Puzzle games depend mainly on logic and strategies. The player solves a puzzle to finish a level. These games should start pretty easy to let the player get the hang of the puzzle, but it should become harder and harder as they progress to win. Still, every level should be solvable. If the game is either too easy or too hard, people will get bored with it. Remember, different players use different strategies to solve a puzzle, so make a puzzle with some possibilities. For the player, the fun in a puzzle game is in finding the best strategy; for the designer, the challenge is in finding the sweet spot for that strategy, somewhere between trivial and merciless.  An action game requires players to use speed, accuracy, and timing to overcome obstacles. Action games need to be full of life and energy, and they should require the player's full attention. The game should depend on speed, navigation, and avoiding obstacles, all of which become more difficult as the game gets faster and faster, bringing more excitement to the player. In that way you take gamers attention. Also add achievements and a ranking system to attract more people and encourage them to play your game for longer.  These include taking care of virtual people or pets, developing cities of societies, and building amusement parks or zoos. Some of these games take hours to play, and maybe incredibly complex. Some simulation games aren’t even played to be won. In stimulation games you can use things from real life. Anything from daily life that you find interesting can become a simulation game, and you can use simulation games to explore areas of life - different jobs, parts of the world, people and animals - that you normally don't get to participate in. For this reason these games can be attractive and endlessly interesting.  Racing games involve speed and challenge. You'll need to choose a vehicle - car, motorcycle, pterodactyl, anything that moves. Design different tracks or race courses where the races will take place. Also include different weapons, power-ups, or anything else you can think of to change the flow of the game and keep it from getting boring.  Assemble a group of people with complementary skills and ideas. Having a team will help you come up with and develop more creative ideas, and it will make the process of building the game much less stressful and more fun. Find friends to help you or find teams online, or else find an existing team to join.  After you finish the game with your teammates, review it, test every part of it in every situation you can think of to try to find bugs, and fix every bug you find. Then before publishing, find an awesome name and description for your game, one that will attract people and make them play.  

review current games in the platform you're interested in.  be original and inventive.  consider creating an adventure game.  brainstorm puzzle games.  think about action games.  consider simulation games, games that are concerned with playing out realistic situations in game settings.  think about creating a racing game.  find the perfect team to help you build your game.  extensively test your game before publishing. 

 If you have a lot of files that need to be converted from JPG to PNG (or any other image format), downloading a conversion program will save you the most time and busywork. These programs also have the benefit of keeping your files local, so that you don't have to upload them to another server for conversion.   One of the most popular batch conversion programs is Bulk Image Converter, an open-source program available for free from SourceForge. Another popular program is Imagicon, but it is ad-supported.  Bulk Image Converter loads entire directories for the conversion process. Place the directory somewhere easy to navigate to, such as on the root of your hard drive.  Load your directory of images into the program. Choose what the original format is. The program will scan for all images of that file type in the directory you selected. Select the format that you want to convert them to (PNG in this case).   You can choose to delete the originals automatically, but this is usually not recommended as errors may occur during the conversion process. Click the Start button to start the converter. You can watch the progress of the conversion process. in the "Progress" section.  After the conversion process has been completed, review your images to ensure that the conversion went smoothly. When doing a batch conversion, there is a small chance that errors may occur with certain images. If this is the case, try converting the problem images individually using the first method of this article.  

download a batch conversion program.  place all the images you want converted in one directory.  start the batch converter.  review your converted images. 

 A reel-spinning slot machine typically features three or five reels or cylinders on which there are imprinted symbols as well as spaces left blank. There are 22 symbols/blanks or "stops" on each reel. Matching these symbols in certain combinations lead to a winning payout. Video slots may have up to seven reels, each representing three rows of five symbols. Video slots have 32 to hundreds of virtual stops on their reels.  Video slot machines may use some of these traditional images but are likely to feature characters or symbols from popular TV shows, cartoons or movies or images of popular actors, singers or sports figures. , Both are controlled by a program called a random number generator (RNG) that determines the outcome of each spin and makes it impossible to determine the outcome of future spins.  There are two main categories for progressive slots machines: “top payout” and “progressive”. With top payouts, that’s how much you could stand to win for “regular” best machine combinations. Some slot machines are known as "flat-top" machines; they have a fixed, maximum payout. Progressive machines feature a meter that indicates a jackpot that gets progressively higher. These machines are linked together and the amount of the jackpot is determined by how much they're being used. The more people play them, the higher the jackpot amount.   Among flat-top machines, the overall odds are generally similar no matter how high the jackpot is. Sometimes a bank of progressive machines in a single casino are linked together. In other cases, the machines are linked throughout the entire state, which explains why they feature such a high jackpot amount. Because of the number of people all vying for that jackpot, your odds of winning at a progressive machines are lower. That goes not only for the jackpot amount, but the odds of winning smaller amounts are lower as well.  To play a slot machine, you must first insert bills or coins. When you insert your money, the equivalent amount of credits is displayed. Your next move depends on the type of machine you've chosen.   On reel-spinning slots, push a button marked "play one credit" until you've reached the number of coins you wish to play. Then hit the "spin reels" button or pull the handle. If you want to bet big, you can hit a button marked "play max credits," which will play the maximum coins allowed on that machine. On video slots, you must push two buttons to complete your bet. First, push one button for the number of paylines you want to activate and then push a second button to chose how many credits you want to bet per line. Video slots generally have five reels spinning on the screen.  Your payout is determined by a winning combination of symbols that appear on what's called the payline. On classic reel spin machines, only one payline is displayed on the face of the machine, but video machines offer more paylines.   Modern multi-line slots may offer 9, 15, 25, 50 and even more paylines. Paylines can be represented horizontally, vertically, diagonally and even in zigzags. Look closely to see what lines you have bet and check carefully as it can be difficult to tell if you have a winning payline.  If you don't understand them, ask an attendant or call customer service if you are playing online. You need to understand what combinations will win you money, especially the jackpot.  

pick a reel-spinning slot or a video slot.  the symbols on a reel-spinning slot machine include brightly colored images of fruits such as lemons and cherries, numerals or shapes such as diamonds, hearts and bells.  some players like the reel-spinning slots with the pull handle because of their retro feel, but they can be difficult to find as more casinos modernize their slot selection.  ,  despite the difference in style, there is no difference in the payout between reel-spinning and video machines of the same denomination.  choose a machine with a fixed or a progressive jackpot.  place your bet.  pick your paylines.  familiarize yourself with the rules for the machine before you sit down. 

 It is important that nursing school is a top priority in your life. Nursing programs are intensive and you will need to prioritize class and study time over non-essential activities.   Try making a list of priorities like school, family, friends, exercise, etc. If nursing school isn’t within the top few priorities on your list, you may need to do some rearranging in order to achieve your goals as a nursing student.  For many nursing programs, you will be required to complete general education courses like English before entering the program. At other schools, you will complete these courses while you are a student in the program. Prioritize these courses as they will help you learn how to communicate effectively, understand diverse human behaviors and experiences, and think critically., As a nursing student you will take courses that are foundational to the field of nursing. Courses in anatomy and physiology, pharmacology, health assessment and promotion, and informatics are part of most nursing programs. Mastering this curriculum is crucial to your success as nurse.Try studying in one hour blocks. Study for the first 50 minutes and then take a 10 minute break before beginning the next study block. Find a study buddy or study group. Your fellow students likely come from a wide variety of backgrounds, and can be a great source of support., Patient-centered revolves around the patient and centers on assessment and treatment of the patient’s problems and disease processes. Person-focused care is based on accumulated knowledge of the patient, helping nurses and doctors assess the patient’s medical needs over time and within context of other needs the patient might have., You should begin building your nursing resume with clinicals, internships, and professional experience as soon as possible. These experiences will help you land a job once you finish school, and help you further develop your understanding of nursing and healthcare.   For example, if you want to work as an emergency room RN and the local hospital announces an internship, apply for it! If you set a goal of learning how to effectively communicate with diverse patient populations, attend a local conference on the subject.  Once you have passed all the clinical and curriculum requirements for your program and graduated with your nursing degree, you will need to begin study for upcoming exams. Nurses are required to pass licensure exams, which vary depending on your nursing education level. These exams include the NCLEX-RN and NCLEX-PN.Talk to your nursing professors about how you can utilize the nursing curriculum from your program to study for licensure and certification exams. Consider taking a NCLEX preparation course to help you achieve the passing standard for the exam.  

prioritize your education.  complete your general education courses.  master foundational science and nursing courses.  learn about patient centered and person-focused care.  take advantage of professional development opportunities.  pass nurse licensure and certification examinations. 

 The most common staple of a hamster’s diet should be the food pellets that you can buy at pet stores specifically intended for hamsters. These pellets contain a variety of seeds and grains that will help give your hamster most of the protein and nutrients it needs on a daily basis.You should provide approximately one tablespoon of pellet or seed mixture food to your hamster each day, supplemented with treats for variety.; , For your hamster to achieve maximum health, it is important that you give it a diverse selection of food. In addition to the food pellets/seed mixtures, you can also feed your hamster various fruits, vegetables, dog biscuits, or a small branch from a fruit-bearing tree.Harder treats like dog biscuits and fruit branches should be offered only once a week. But they will also help wear down your hamster’s teeth, which will be good for your pet as it ages. Don’t feed your hamster citrus fruits or onions. These food items will give your hamster an upset stomach., Giving your hamster fruits and vegetables occasionally (even small daily amounts) is a good idea to help them maintain a balanced diet.However, too many fruits and vegetables can lead to diarrhea and other physical problems, so be sure to limit the amount that you give them. Think of it as more of a treat, rather than a main part of their diet.Some good fruits/vegetables to try out with your hamster are peas, carrots, banana, broccoli, grapes, cucumber, apple, and celery., Hamsters are more likely to grow accustomed to new foods if you start introducing them to new things when they are very young (even just a few weeks old). The older you let your hamster get before trying new foods, the more likely it will be to prefer what it is used to and refuse the new items., The best way to see if your hamster will accept a new kind of food is to give them a small portion and see how they react. Give your hamster access to the new food type by placing a tiny piece of it in your hamster’s food bowl alongside its regular food. , Give your hamster the food you normally would, but add a tiny bit of a new food gradually for several days. This will allow your pet to become accustomed to the new food while still having access to the food you already know it will eat.Introducing the new food slowly will also give your hamster time to adjust to the new food and avoid any potential negative side effects like an upset stomach.  If your hamster seems resistant to trying new foods, start feeding it several times a day in smaller portions. But don’t refill your pet’s food bowl until it has eaten most of the contents from the previous feeding., While it is important to provide a healthy, balanced diet for your hamster, don’t get too caught up in the extras. Your hamster’s diet should consist mostly of pellet/seed mixture food with smaller amounts of additional items (as discussed above)., If your hamster seems to like broccoli, but you’re always throwing away the bits of celery you offer it, then take that as a sign that your hamster doesn’t like celery. Pay attention to what is left over in the hamster’s cage when you clean it every week. If you see the same foods end up as waste repeatedly, it might be time to try a different food. , Hamsters are notorious for filling their cheeks with food and continuing to beg for more. However, hamsters won’t eat everything you give them, so be mindful. They will hoard the extra food in their bedding, which may begin to rot and become unhealthy for the hamster to be around. Only feed your hamster as much food as it needs to live comfortably. 

give your hamster pellet food.  feed your hamster a variety of foods.  keep the fruits and vegetables to a minimum.  start young.  place a new food item in their food dish.  introduce the food gradually over a period of days.  feed your hamster smaller portions.  stick with the staples.  cater to your pet’s preferences.  don’t overfeed your hamster. 

 When you purchase a nonstick pan, it will come with some basic instructions regarding how to use, clean, and store the pan. Before you begin cooking with your pan, read all of the instructions carefully. Many people will accidentally damage their pan by failing to follow basic instructions., Before using your pan, season it in order to lengthen the lifespan of the pan and to actually help improve the way food cooks in the pan. You should also re-season your pan periodically throughout its lifespan.To season a pan, simply rinse and dry the pan using water. Then put a dollop of oil (any type) in the pan and coat the entire surface using a paper towel.  When you are cooking with a nonstick pan, you should always use plastic, nylon, or wooden utensils. Metal utensils will scratch the surface of the pan and will lead to chips and scrapes in the nonstick coating. This can drastically decrease the lifespan of your pan., You should always add some lubricant to your pan prior to heating, even when using nonstick pans. For instance, you could coat the pan using butter or oil prior to heating. If you add oil or butter after the pan has been heated, it will likely get soaked up by the food you are cooking and not actually aid in preventing food from sticking to the pan., When using a nonstick pan, do not use cooking sprays as lubricant. Over time, the grease from the spray that doesn’t get burned off during the cooking process will build up and create a sticky layer. This layer will often develop around the sides of the pan and is extremely difficult to remove through cleaning.As a result, lubricate your pan with butter or oil instead.  Another common mistake that people make while cooking with a nonstick pan is placing it on high heat. This can actually damage the pan, causing the nonstick coating to crack. Instead, cook your food over low or medium heat. Cooking using high heat can also burn or dry out your food, so simmering at a lower temperature for a longer period is recommended. 

read all instructions carefully.  season the pan.  avoid using metal utensils.  coat the pan with butter or oil prior to heating.  avoid using cooking sprays.  cook using low or medium heat. 

 Pressing flowers preserves the color and shape of the petals, but the shape of the hydrangea blossom itself will be flattened.   Cut the hydrangea blossoms in half to preserve and flatten their round shape. Cut individual flowers and plan to arrange them in the shape of a hydrangea blossom after they're dried.  A press is made with two pieces of plywood that are tightened with screws and wing nuts. Remove the top piece of plywood and lay a piece of cardboard followed by two sheets of parchment or pressing paper on the bottom piece of plywood.   The cardboard and parchment paper should be cut a few inches smaller than the bottom of the press. The bottom sheet of parchment paper is called the "blotter." It absorbs moisture from the drying flower and is switched out every few days. The top sheet of parchment paper anchors the flowers during the drying process.  Arrange them so that no petals or folded or crushed, unless you are trying to create a windblown effect.   A little layering is fine, but don't build too many layers of petals, or they won't dry out correctly. If you wish, add other foliage like leaves, ferns and other flowers.  Cover the flowers with a sheet of parchment paper, a second "blotter" sheet, a piece of cardboard, and the top piece of the flower press. Screw the plywood pieces together and tighten them with the wing nuts.  Set the press in a dry place in your home and let the drying process begin.   Open the press and change out the blotter sheets every few days. Discard the old sheets and replace them with fresh ones. After a week or two, the flowers should be completely dry. Remove them from the press.  They are now ready to use in craft projects such as cards or jewelry. Pressed flowers also look beautiful mounted on a card and framed.  

prepare the flowers for pressing.  prepare the press.  lay the flowers on the top sheet of parchment paper.  finish assembling the flower press.  allow the flowers to dry.  lift the pressed flowers from the parchment paper. 

 Leading a healthy lifestyle is all about balance and moderation. To enjoy chocolate without derailing your weight-loss goals, increase the amount of fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins in your diet.If you focus on eating nutritious foods, counting calories won’t be necessary.Try to fill up half of your plate with vegetables and fruits. One quarter of your plate should be filled with lean proteins, like baked chicken or fish, and the remaining quarter can be reserved for whole grains like whole wheat pasta, quinoa, or brown rice.Cut back on your intake of processed foods, fried foods, saturated fats, and sugar as much as possible., Each week, aim to exercise for about 150 minutes, or for about 30 minutes for 5 days each week.On days when you plan to have a chocolate treat, increase activities like walking, swimming, or dancing to help burn extra calories.

); , These ports can frequently be found on USB extension cords.  Strip the wires Find the black (-) and red (+) wires. Make sure these are separate from the green and white data wires.  Be careful not to add too much as it may not fit in the Altoids tin. About 9 inches (22.9 cm) branching off of the female USB should suffice.  For now, they do not need to be charged. (Hint: rechargeable AAA batteries can cheaply be bought on eBay or similar auction site. These batteries are rated by the amount of power they can store not the power that they output. The units used are milli-Amp hours (mAh), which can be explained as the current (in milli-Amps) needed to fully discharge the battery in an hour. A 1000 mAh battery will last twice as long on one charge as a 500 mAh battery. AAA battery holders can cheaply be bought from Radio Shack, make sure it will fit in the Altoids tin--this usually means to buy the thinner square looking one--see picture in Things You'll Need.)  , Remember red to red and black to black. Soldering is usually the way to go. Other methods are twisting the wires together, but this is unreliable. Remember to cover the exposed connected wire in insulated material (like PVC or electrical tape) to avoid letting the positive and negative wires touch.  If using a Dremel, beware of sparks that can ignite flammable materials. Make sure it is one of the shorter sides--not the sides above or below the text--to the left or right only.  Make the ON/OFF switch (if your battery holder has one) to the battery holder is up so that when you open the tin you see it the female USB port not stick out of the USB port, but have it line up so it doesn't stick out.  You can also put double sided tape or hot glue on the battery holder so it doesn't move.  Your charger is now complete. If your batteries are uncharged, follow the last step to charge.  Cut the ends off 2 USB cables, leaving as much wire possible after the USB connector. Strip the wire exposing the colored wires. You may cut the white and green wires. Strip the red and black wires. Connect the wires together (red to red and black to black) by soldering or wire twisting (unreliable.) Cover the individual wire connections together with electrical tape, having 2 separate pieces (cover the black to black separately and red to red separately.) Then after the reds and the blacks are separately covered in tape, you can cover these connections with electrical tape so you are left with a single wire.  Your charging. After a few hours, charging is complete.

 To remove lumps, sift the powdered sugar into a medium mixing bowl. Then add the orange zest and whisk the two ingredients together.To change the flavor of the icing slightly, you can also add or substitute different citrus zests, such as lemon, grapefruit, or lime.  Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of juice and whisk to combine. Whisk in more juice as needed if the icing is too thick. The ideal glaze consistency depends on what you're looking for:For a thinner glaze that you can drizzle over cookies and cakes, add more orange juice to make the glaze a little runny. For a thicker glaze that you can dip cupcakes into without it running, add less juice.  There are several ways that you can apply a glaze icing to different desserts. Check the recipe you're working with to see if it calls for special instructions.   For cakes and Bundt cakes, run a whisk or spoon through the glaze and then drizzle it over the cake, letting the glaze run down the sides. For cupcakes, dip the top of each cupcake into the glaze. Let the excess drip off over the bowl, then flip the cupcake over (right-side up) and let the glaze set for about 15 minutes. For cookies, use a pastry brush to brush the glaze onto the top of each cookie. 

whisk together the sugar and zest.  whisk in the orange juice.  apply the glaze. 

 There are three basic types of questions you will be asked: relevant, irrelevant and control. Irrelevant questions are those that are obvious, such as “What is your name?” or “Are the lights on in this room?” Relevant questions are the important ones, such as “Did you leak that memo to the media,” “Have you ever stolen money from an employer?” or “Have you ever sold drugs?” Control questions are those against which your reactions to relevant questions will be compared. These are usually questions to which (just about) everybody can answer “yes,” but which everybody is uncomfortable honestly answering. Examples might include, “Have you ever lied to get out of trouble?” or “Have you ever taken anything of value from an employer?”  , The polygrapher may ask you, before the test if you’ve done any research on polygraph tests or what you know about them. Do not disclose that you’ve done extensive research. Act as though you don’t know much about polygraph examinations, but that you do believe polygraphy to be a science and polygraphs to be reliable (or at least do not exhibit any doubt as to their reliability). The polygrapher may try to trick you by mentioning certain technical terms and acronyms such as, “Your test came back NDI.” While you will know that “NDI” means “no deception indicated,” you need to act as though you have no idea what it means. Too much knowledge of the process may make the polygrapher think you’ve got something to hide, even if you don’t.  

identify the types of questions you are being asked.  conceal your knowledge of polygraphy.

 There are a number of thought patterns that are often present among those who attempt suicide.If someone tells you they are experiencing one or more of these issues, this may be a matter for concern. For example:   Suicidal individuals frequently dwell on a thought obsessively, unable to stop thinking about it. Suicidal individuals often believe there is no hope for them, and no way to end the pain other than killing themselves. Suicidal individuals often see life as meaningless, or believe they have no control over their lives. Suicidal individuals often describe the sensation that their brain is in a fog, or have difficulty concentrating.; , Similarly, suicidal individuals frequently experience troubled emotional states that can lead them to drastic actions. For example:   Suicidal people often suffer from extreme mood swings.Suicidal individuals often experience extreme anger, rage, or vengeful feelings.Suicidal people often suffer from high levels of anxiety.They are also frequently irritable.Suicidal people often experience strong feelings of guilt or shame, or the sense that they are a burden to others.Suicidal people often experience a sense of loneliness or isolation, even when among other people,and may also exhibit signs of shame or humiliation., There are many verbal cues that might signify that someone may be experiencing these types of distress and may be planning to take their own life. For example, if someone talks a lot about dying, this may be a warning sign if it's not something that person normally would do.There are also many other verbal cues to look out for, such as a person making any of the statements below.“It’s just not worth it,” “Life isn’t worth living,” or “It doesn’t matter anymore.” “They won't have me around to hurt anymore.” “They’ll miss me when I’m gone,” or “You’ll be sorry when I’m gone.” “I just can’t stand the pain,” or “I just can’t deal with everything — life’s too hard.” “I’m so lonely I wish I could die.” “You/my family/my friends/my girlfriend or boyfriend would be better off without me.” “Next time I’ll take enough pills to do the job right.” “Don’t worry, I won’t be around to deal with that.” “I won’t be in your way much longer.” “Nobody understands me — nobody feels the way I do.” “I feel like there is no way out,” or “There’s nothing I can do to make it better.” “I’d be better off dead,” or “I wish I was never born.”  , Keep in mind that the highest potential for suicide is not necessarily when a person appears to have hit rock bottom, but may instead be when they appear to be getting better.   A sudden improvement in mood may indicate that the individual has made peace with the decision to end their life, and perhaps even has a plan in place for doing so.As such, if someone has been showing signs of depression or suicidal feelings and suddenly seems much happier, you should take preventative steps without delay.  People planning suicide may take measures to settle their affairs before proceeding.This is a major warning sign, since someone tying up loose ends probably has a suicide plan in place. Someone who is suicidal may do one or more of these to get ready:   Give away their prized possessions.Make financial arrangements, such as suddenly writing a will.Say goodbye to loved ones. A person that is considering suicide may suddenly make a point of saying a heartfelt goodbye at odd times., Since suicidal people feel no reason to live, they may take risks that could lead to death, like driving recklessly or while impaired. Here are few potential signs to look out for:   Excessive use of drugs (legal or illegal) and alcohol.Reckless driving, such as driving too fast or under the influence.Unprotected sex, often with multiple partners., It's a good idea to investigate whether the person has recently purchased a gun,or might be stockpiling legal or illegal pills.If someone seems to be collecting medication or purchasing new weapons out of the blue, it's important to act quickly. Once their plan is in place the person could commit suicide at any time.  Avoiding friends, family, or coworkers is common among suicidal individuals, who often quietly withdraw from normal social interactions.Take action, rather than just listening to someone who says "I just want to be left alone."  , If someone suddenly stops going to their weekly pick up basketball games or their favorite game nights this could be a warning sign.   Skipping out on going out or taking part in activities they normally enjoy could indicate that someone is feeling unhappy, depressed, or possibly suicidal., Suicidal, depressed individuals often have little energy for basic mental and physical tasks. In particular, be on the lookout for:   Unusual difficulty making ordinary decisions.Loss of interest in sex.General lack of energy, behaviors like staying in bed all day., If the person in question is a teenager, watch for additional common warning signs and possible triggers for teens.For example:   The teen is in trouble with their family or the law. Life circumstances like a recent breakup with a boyfriend or girlfriend, not getting into their college of choice, or the loss of a close friend. Lack of friends, trouble in social situations, or withdrawal from close friends. Self-care issues, like insufficient eating or overeating, hygiene issues like infrequent showering, or lack of concern about appearance (e.g., a teenager who who suddenly stops using makeup or dressing well). Drawing or painting scenes of death. Sudden shifts in their normal behavior like a drastic drop in grades, drastic personality changes, or rebellious actions may also be warning signs. Conditions like an eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia can also lead to feelings of depression, anxiety, and possibly suicide. A child or teen being bullied or bullying others may also be at a higher risk for suicide.  An individual's experiences, both recent and distant, can also make one more likely to attempt suicide.   The death of a loved one, the loss of a job, a serious illness (especially involving chronic pain), bullying, and other highly stressful life events can act as triggers for suicide and put someone at greater risk.Of particular concern is whether a person has tried to commit suicide before. Someone who has previously attempted suicide is likely to try again. In fact, one fifth of the people who die by suicide have made a previous attempt.A history of physical or sexual abuse also puts one at a higher risk of suicide., The presence of an underlying mental health disorder, such as bipolar disorder, major depression, or schizophrenia, or a history of such disorders, is a major risk factor. In fact, 90 percent of suicide cases are linked to depression or another mental illness, and 66 percent of people who think seriously about suicide have a mental disorder of some kind.   Disorders characterized by anxiety or agitation (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder) and poor impulse-control (e.g., bipolar disorder, conduct disorders, substance disorders) are the most likely risk factors for making a suicide plan and a suicide attempt. The symptoms of mental illnesses that raise the risk of suicide include intense anxiety, panic attacks, desperation, hopelessness, feeling that one is a burden, loss of interest and pleasure, and delusional thinking.While the statistical relationship between suicide and depression is a complicated one, the majority of people who die from a suicide attempt have major depression.People with more than one mental health problem are at especially high risk of suicide. Having two mental disorders nearly doubles the risk of suicide, and three nearly triples the risk of suicide when compared to people who endure one mental disorder.  Scientists aren't certain yet whether the central cause is environment, heredity, or a combination of both, but suicide does seem to run in families.   At least some research suggests there is a genetic cause for this relationship, so even if someone was not raised by their biological parents, this may be a risk factor.Environmental influences in one's family life also may play a role.  While anyone can become suicidal, statistically speaking, some social groups have higher rates of suicide than others. If someone you know may be at risk, consider the following:   Males are more likely to commit suicide. For every age group and ethnicity, the rate of suicide for males is quadruple the rate for females. In fact, men account for 79% of all suicides.Regardless of gender, LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) individuals are four times more likely to commit suicide.Older people are more likely to commit suicide than young people. People between the ages of 45 and 59 have the highest suicide rate, and people older than 74 years have the second highest rate of suicide.Native Americans and Caucasians (whites) are also statistically more likely to commit suicide than other ethnic groups. These trends don't mean you shouldn't be worried about someone who is not in one of these high risk groups. If the person you are concerned about displays signs of being suicidal, regardless of their gender or age, take their situation seriously. However, if someone is part of one of these groups, their risk may be higher.  If someone you know is exhibiting signs of being suicidal, one of the most important things you can do is talk to that person about what you've noticed in a loving and non-judgmental way.   Be a good listener. Maintain eye-contact, pay close attention, and respond in a gentle tone.  A good starting point is to say: “I've noticed you’ve been feeling really down lately, and I have been very concerned. Are you having thoughts of suicide?”   If the person says yes, the next step is to ask: “Do you have a plan for suicide?” If they answer in the affirmative, call 911 immediately! A person who has a plan needs to get help right away. Stay with the person until help arrives., There are some things that may seem helpful to say, but actually may increase a suicidal person's guilt or shame.For example, avoid the following types of comments:   “Tomorrow is another day. Everything will look better then.” “It can always be worse. You should feel lucky for everything you have.” “You have so much to look forward to/You have everything going for you.” “Don’t worry. Everything/you will be fine.”  , Some types of comments can convey the idea that you don't take the person's feelings seriously.Avoid the following types of remarks:   "Things aren’t that bad." “You wouldn’t hurt yourself.” “I’ve felt overwhelmed too, and I made it through.”  , If someone confides in you that they are suicidal, do not agree to keep the matter a secret.This person needs help as soon as possible. Keeping the matter secret will only delay needed assistance.  If you believe someone is an immediate suicide risk, call 911 without delay.  Suicide hotlines aren't just for people who are suicidal. They also provide help for people trying to prevent another person's suicide.   Even if you just need to know what to do, a suicide hotline can help. They can talk you through the immediate situation or direct you to take further, more serious actions. They are also connected to doctors and counselors across the nation.In the US, you can call 800-SUICIDE (800-784-2433) or 800-273-TALK (800-273-8255).In the UK, call 08457 90 90 90., Make sure the person sees a mental health professional as soon as possible.The suicide hotline numbers provided above can refer you to a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist, or you can find one online who specializes in this area.   By being there for this person and leading him or her to qualified professional help, you can prevent a suicide and save a life. Don't waste time. Sometimes preventing a suicide comes down to a matter of days or even hours, so the sooner this person can get the help they need, the better.  It may be helpful to contact the suicidal person's parents, guardians, or other loved ones.This can take some of the pressure off you, since they can be involved in the effort to stop this person from committing suicide. Getting these individuals involved may also help the suicidal person see that others care about them.  If possible, remove any lethal items from the person's home.This includes firearms, drugs, or any other weapons or poisons.   Be thorough. People can kill themselves with many items you wouldn't necessarily think of. Items like rat poison, cleaning products, and even ordinary cutlery can be used in a suicide attempt. About 25 percent of all suicides are carried out by suffocation. Usually, this means hanging. So make sure to remove items like ties, belts, ropes, and sheets.Let the individual know you will hold onto these items until he or she is feeling better.  Even after immediate danger has passed, stay engaged with the person. Someone who is depressed or feeling isolated is not likely to ask for help, so you'll need to make yourself present. Call, visit, and generally follow up with the person frequently to see how he or she is doing. Here are other ways you can provide ongoing support:Make sure the person goes to their therapy appointments. Offer to drive the person there so you can be sure that he or she follows through on the appointment. Make sure the person takes any prescribed medication. Don't be an enabler when it comes to drinking or using recreational drugs. Someone who is suicidal should not be drinking or doing drugs. Help the person make a safety plan in case he or she keeps having suicidal thoughts. This should be a list of things the person can do to avoid committing suicide, such as calling loved ones, staying with a friend or even checking into a hospital.  If you are experiencing the suicidal feelings described above and believe you are imminently at risk of committing suicide (i.e. you have a plan and the means to carry it out), call 911 immediately. You are in need of emergency help., While you are waiting for first-responders to arrive, call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-TALK.This will help pass the time and decrease the risk until help comes.  If you are having suicidal thoughts and feelings but do not have a plan, make an appointment with a therapist or counselor.If your situation worsens while you await your appointment and you develop a suicide plan, call 911.  

recognize suicidal thought patterns.  recognize suicidal emotions.  recognize verbal warnings.  beware of sudden improvement.  look for signs of "tying up loose ends.",  look out for reckless, dangerous behavior.  look for the means to commit suicide.  be aware of social withdrawal.  note any extreme changes in routine.  be aware of unusually lethargic behavior.  watch for warning signs in teens.  consider life history and current circumstances.  consider the individual's mental health.  investigate any family history of suicide.  consider the demographics of suicide.  set the right tone.  raise the issue directly.  avoid making the situation worse.  avoid making statements that seem dismissive.  don't keep secrets.  call 911.  call a suicide hotline.  refer the suicidal person to professional help.  notify family members.  remove the tools of suicide.  continue to offer support.  call 911.  call a suicide hotline.  see a mental health professional. 

 Physical activity can help release tension and re-energize your brain.In fact, some studies suggest that exercise is one of the most recommended stress-relief techniques.Stretch, do a few yoga poses, or tai chi. Slow, steady movements can release tension in your back, neck, and shoulders and help you calm yourself. Take a walk, jog in place, do a few jumping jacks. Studies indicate that even a few minutes of aerobic activity can decrease stress.Roll your neck and shoulders. Wiggle your fingers and toes. Even small movements can help you calm down when you are stressed.  When you have the opportunity, do something small, but enjoyable to give yourself a dose of happiness.When you are happy, even for an instant, your body releases chemicals that decrease your level of stress.Play one round of your favorite games (e.g., Candy Crush, Angry Birds, etc.). Don’t get caught up in the game, though! This is only a small treat to improve your mood. Look at a short, funny video or a humorous meme. Laughing or even just internally chuckling can reduce tension and relieve stress instantly., Having some fruit or another small, nutritious snack is a great way to boost your mood.  While you shouldn’t make unhealthy snacking a regular part of your stress-reduction routine, having a healthy snack as a pick me up every now and then can be beneficial.  Blueberries, for example, have been found to reduce stress by increasing white blood cells. While other fruit can help balance blood sugar levels that may fluctuate due to stress.Try some broccoli which is a natural stress reducer.Have a small piece of dark chocolate. Many recent studies have shown the positive impact dark chocolate can have an reducing stress and anxiety.

Eating cinnamon either in its natural form or in supplement form has been shown to improve symptoms of PCOS. This is especially true for those experiencing insulin resistance.The typical recommended dosage is 500-1000 mg capsules or 2 tsp of the ground spice, taken daily. Although not all studies showed significant benefits of using cinnamon to help reduce insulin resistance, some show that cinnamon is especially effective for insulin resistance combined with PCOS., Another supplement that may help manage insulin resistance associated with PCOS is chromium.Chromium supplements may help reduce insulin resistance, help regulate blood glucose levels, and reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.Those who have insulin resistance and PCOS may choose to take chromium picolinate daily.The recommended dosage is 200 mcg daily.  This herbal supplement may regulate menstrual cycles, decrease breast tenderness and help improve fertility.The recommended dosage is 20 mg to 40 mg daily for up to 3 months.It’s not clear whether or not chaste tree berry works to improve symptoms of PCOS, since studies have had contradictory results.

 If you suspect that a loved one has Alzheimer’s disease, learn about signs, symptoms, early detection, and your role as a potential caregiver. The more you learn about this brain disease, the better prepared you will be to handle impending changes in your loved one.Check with your local health department for resources, such as support groups and classes dealing with Alzheimer’s education. Your local hospital may have printed resources in their library for your use. Several websites offer accessible, easy to read information about Alzheimer’s disease. These include http://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_what_is_alzheimers.asp and http://www.alzfdn.org/AboutAlzheimers/definition.html ; , You’ll need to assess safety risks in the home in which the person with Alzheimer’s disease lives. If you find potential safety risks, make every effort to remedy them right away. Even if the person is in the early stages of the disease, it’s best not to leave them alone until safety risks are resolved.When looking for safety issues, evaluate every part of the home for the patient’s potential to harm themselves, another person, or damage property. For example, they may have a gas stove, which poses a few safety risks (gas poisoning, unattended open flame, potential burns). Purchase knob covers so that the patient won’t be able to turn the gas or the stove on. For larger safety risks that aren’t easily resolved, such as steep stairs, you may find yourself in a position of having to decide if it is in the patient’s best interest to remain in the home.  Encouraging Alzheimer’s patients to maintain independence and carry on with daily responsibilities helps foster their independence. It also helps them focus, remember, and maintain organization, which are important exercises in the beginning stages of dementia. How active you must be in these activities may fluctuate and depends entirely on the person whom you’re helping.You may need to take initiative and oversee areas of their life, but can foster independence at the same time. The tasks that they will need assistance with may deal primarily with management and organization: managing their money, transportation, keeping appointments, keeping track of medications, and even remember words, people, and places.  Living with an Alzheimer’s diagnosis can be intensely difficult for some people, and will elicit a variety of emotional responses from most patients. You can be helpful by facilitating those emotions, allowing the person to feel them without explanation, but also helping them move from frustration to proactively helping themselves.Typical responses include fear, denial, anger, anxiety, and depression. Encourage them to write their feelings and thoughts down, such as in a journal. This is a safe way for them to work through what they’re feeling, and also helps them practice writing and organizing their thoughts.  Talk with the person that you’re helping about the future, especially while they’re in the beginning stages of the disease. Find out how they’d like to be cared for, where they would like to stay, what sort of medical interventions they approve of, how this care will be financed, and update documents such as their will and power of attorney designation.Having the conversations now and planning ahead now will not only be easier on you both, but will help ensure that you’re giving the person the sort of care that they want.  Routines are helpful for anyone, whether they have Alzheimer’s or not, because they remove uncertainty. With a routine, you already know what your tasks are and how you need to accomplish them. Develop routines for yourself and the person with Alzheimer’s disease, which will help foster their independence, alleviate some potential anxiety on their part, and also help you see any changes in their physical or cognitive abilities., To be an effective caregiver, you must prioritize how you care for yourself. If you do not take care of yourself, you won’t have the physical, mental, or emotional resources to care for anyone else. Alzheimer’s is a progressive disease, meaning it is increasingly demanding. Every month or so, honestly evaluate your needs and abilities, to ensure that you’re providing the best care for yourself and the Alzheimer’s patient.Caregivers often report feeling guilty for needing assistance with an Alzheimer’s patient, or even a day or week off. It’s important that you understand that you have to recharge if you’re going to be helpful. You’re not less of a loved one or caregiver if you ask for help. In fact, you’re demonstrating that you’ve considered what’s best for your loved one and your abilities to meet their needs. Asking for help shows that you are doing what you can to make sure those needs are met. Find support — through local groups, through doctors, online, and with family. Your loved one needs assistance, and you need support. Sharing experiences with others will help you work through your emotions, and may even point you toward good resources or tips that help you in your care giving.  

educate yourself about alzheimer’s disease.  assess safety risks in the home.  foster their independence.  allow their emotional responses.  plan ahead.  develop routines.  prioritize self-care. 

 When you enjoy soft serve at a restaurant, it's usually served in a cone or a bowl in a tidy-looking spiraling arrangement, rather than as a rough-looking "clump." To get this presentation, transfer the soft serve to a piping bag (which are often used to apply frosting to baked goods) and squeeze the ice cream through the hole or nozzle, piling it in a spiraling circle.  Stop squeezing and use a "dipping" motion to break the stream of ice cream and get a "curled over" look when you're done.  The recipes above are for vanilla ice cream, but it's not hard to get other flavors. Simply keep the non-vanilla ingredients (milk, cream, sugar, etc.) the same and replace the vanilla ingredients with your preferred flavorings. There's practically no limit to what you can add, but things like syrups, blended fruits, and powdered ingredients all work well because they can blend uniformly through the mixture.  For example, if you want to make chocolate ice cream, try adding 1/2 cup of cocoa powder to either recipe in place of the vanilla flavoring.  Nothing goes with ice cream like a crunchy, flavorful cone. You can buy these from the store, but you can also make better-tasting cones at home from a few simple ingredients. See ] to get started — note that you will need a waffle cone or pizzelle press, both of which look like shallow waffle makers., One easy way to customize your ice cream is to add "fillings" to it. These are chunks of your favorite ingredients that you simply fold into the soft serve ice cream once it's nearly finished churning. Below are just a few ideas:  Chocolate chips Sliced strawberries Chunks of cookie or cookie dough Corn flakes or breakfast cereal Caramel Chocolate fudge  

use a piping bag for a classic soft serve look.  add new ingredients to get different flavors.  make your own cone.  add fillings to the ice cream. 

 First decide why you want to volunteer in South Africa. Do you want to contribute in a project, club traveling with volunteering or hone your professional skills? Set your priorities straight and prepare yourself for your project.; , It's important to gather information about the country. Weather, population, lifestyle, challenges that the country is facing, cultural sensitivities and other such relevant details are important to know before deciding to volunteer in South Africa.  One can volunteer in different locations in South Africa, such as Port Elizabeth and Cape Town, among others. Keep the information regarding these places handy and decide as to where you want to volunteer. You can keep the activity and sightseeing options as a deciding factor when zeroing down on the location.  Be it volunteering in an orphanage or teaching kids, working in a wildlife conservation project  or any other project that interests you. Keep your skills and interests in mind before deciding on your volunteering project.  Depending on the weather, health and socio-political conditions in mind, decide which is the best time to volunteer in South Africa and make your travel plan accordingly.  It is always good to contact an international volunteering placement organization to volunteer abroad since they have the expertise of providing the volunteering project that is relevant to both the volunteers and the recipients of volunteering. It is also always safer to volunteer through such organizations. Cross Cultural Solutions, Volunteering Solutions, and UN Volunteering are some of the organizations that you can contact for good volunteering placements.  It is always advisable to prepare for your trip beforehand. Pack the necessities, read about your location, inquire about your volunteering project, make a list of the places that you want to visit, get your vaccinations done and buy your travel insurance. With preparation, you will make the most of your volunteering stint.  Volunteering can be a very demanding and challenging exercise, as you’re expected to make a difference in the lives of people who are devoid of the basic facilities in life and are living under abject poverty. You are expected to be committed and dedicated towards your project and must give your best to the project you are volunteering for. Volunteering requires you to be patient, committed and hard working.  Apart from the volunteering work, you should not forget to explore the location where you are headed, as it will give you a lasting experience. Living in a volunteer house or with a host family will give you a taste of the local culture and an authentic travel experience.  Volunteering abroad lets you create memories for life as you make new friends while doing so. Going to a new destination, spending time with the locals, sightseeing in the region, and above all, volunteering towards a noble cause are all experiences that will stay with you for years to come.  

decide why you want to volunteer there.  gather information about the place.  decide on the location where you want to volunteer.  decide on what kind of volunteering projects you want to take up.  find out which is the best time to volunteer in south africa.  contact an international volunteering placement organization.  prepare for your trip.  give your best to the volunteering project.  explore the place.  create memories for life. 

 You must become your own protector, and you have to prove to yourself that you will and can make choices within your control to allow yourself to feel safe.Begin to reconnect with what feels safe to you. How do you feel safe in your home? Who are the people in your life who make you feel safe? What are things you do that make you feel safe? This can even simple things like curling up with your favorite blanket, or familiar movies that comfort you, cuddling with your pet or places like the library, a museum or a favorite coffee shop? You have the power to shape your life around safety, and once you start to intentionally create safety in your life, it will be easier to ingrain messages of healthy self esteem into your identity.  Survivors of abuse often have poor boundaries when it comes to their personal and professional lives. If you are a survivor, it can be difficult to learn to stand up for yourself. However, you deserve to have your needs met in a healthy, safe way just like every other human being. Begin to tune in to the new wants and needs of your self-esteem and nurture yourself as you let go of the negative thoughts that have been ingrained in you. For example, become comfortable saying "no" if someone asks you to do something you don’t want to do. Give yourself permission to be assertive and make your opinion, wants, and desires known.Some research has shown that assertiveness training can have positive implications for the survivors of some types of abuse and assault. Acting assertively can also help you feel better about yourself and heighten your self confidence.Try reading books about co-dependency to get a feel of what healthy boundaries feel like. Relationships should be mutually reinforcing and beneficial, not purely "give" on one side and "take" on the others. Take time for yourself to do whatever YOU want to do, like watch a movie or going to your favorite restaurant.  Focus on all of your accomplishments and achievements. You'll see that you have lots to be proud of and that you offer real value to the world and to yourself.Consider writing down your achievements, positive attributes or things you value about yourself, and the ways in which you have helped others. You can write in a freestyle manner or create a list of different categories. See this exercise as never-ending; always add to the list as you do new things, such as graduate from school, rescue a puppy, or win an award. Also draw attention to things that make you happy with yourself; maybe you like that you are goal-directed or are good at making people laugh.Return to your list whenever you have doubts or feel that you are not measuring up. Recalling all of the things that you have done and continue to do will help you build a more positive self-image. This is an exercise in retraining your thought patterns and it will not happen overnight.Remind yourself that you are worthy of love regardless of your positive attributes, successes, and achievements. All of these things are fantastic, and you should be proud, but even if these things faded away, you would still be worthy of love because of who you are as a person. Your abuser’s mistreatment of you does not dictate your value.  You will have to take a firm stance in combating negative thoughts. One of the most powerful statements to tell yourself is "I will not continue the legacy of my abuser."This sentence gives the power back to you. It enables you to make the decision to move forward even though you have been hurt and abused. It takes the power away from your abuser. Make this one of your mantras. Use that pledge like your shield and sword against negative thoughts that reduce your self-esteem.   For example, when negative thoughts arise, you can say “I will not continue the legacy of my abuser” either softly to yourself or in your head. You could also write down the statement on a piece of paper that you keep in your wallet or purse. You deserve to live a free and healthy life of your own choosing. You have survived and no one can take that away from you.  Transforming the negative things you think about yourself into positives is one method to fight back against negativity. Confronting and challenging your negative belief patterns as a survivor of abuse is a key step in regaining your power and self esteem. Once you can dispute the messages of abuse that you have internalized, you can begin to free yourself from endless cycle of feeling helpless.For example, if you tell yourself you are ugly, you could tell yourself that you look nice today. If you tell yourself you never do anything right, tell yourself that you do lots of things right and give some specific examples. Instead of focusing on how stupid you are because you forgot your phone/keys/wallet, tell yourself that you're just a normal person who makes mistakes. Consider doing this exercise in a journal to keep track of your positive thoughts. Read them before you go to bed and when you get up. Alternatively, make signs on post-it notes with these positive statements and put them where you can see them, such as on the bathroom mirror. This can help reinforce these statements and ingrain them in your mind. Over time, the positive thoughts will supplant the negative ones.  Some of us feel so bad about ourselves, particularly after experiencing a trauma, that we think it's pointless to put time and effort into caring for ourselves. Ultimately, taking care of yourself can also help improve your self-esteem. The healthier you are in mind and body, the better the possibility that you will be satisfied with yourself. Make healthy changes to your life, like diet and exercise.   Research has shown that exercise can give a real boost to self-esteem. This is because exercise causes the body to release the "happy chemicals" called endorphins. This feeling of euphoria can be accompanied by increased positivity and energy. Try to get up to at least 30 minutes of vigorous exercise at least three times a week. At the very least, set aside time for a brisk walk every day.Try to incorporate more fresh fruits and vegetables into your diet. Eat at least three meals a day that are based on healthy and nutrient-rich foods, such as whole grains, poultry and fish, and fresh vegetables to keep yourself energized and nourished.Taking care of yourself can help to remind your body and mind that you are in charge, that you are taking care of yourself, and that you are treating yourself the way you deserve.  Set aside time to do something that makes you happy every day, whether that means cooking, reading, exercising, gardening, or spending an hour just talking on the phone with a friend.Experiment with new activities; you might learn about talents or skills you didn't know you possessed. Maybe you take up running track and discover that you are really good at long-distance running, something you'd never thought of before. This can help increase your self-esteem.Consider taking up artistic activities such as painting, music, poetry, and dance. Artistic endeavors often help people learn how to express themselves and attain a sense of 'mastery' of a subject or skill. Lots of community sentences offer free or reasonably-priced classes.  Consider "paying it forward" and helping other people. There is significant research indicating that people who actively help others or volunteer have higher self-esteem and feel happier than those who do not. As an added bonus, not only will you be happier, but someone else might also be as well.There are so many ways to get involved with others and make a real difference. Consider volunteering at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter. Offer to coach a children's sports team or your local chapter of girl guides. Volunteer at your local animal shelter or other non-profit organization.  Deep breathing relaxes the mind and body. If you begin to feel scared or anxious, place your hands on your belly, plant your feet firmly on the floor and breath all the way down to through your belly to your feet. Imagine your breath to be like a wave coursing through your body. Do this ten times.   As you breathe, remind yourself you are safe. Imagine someone, something, or even a place that makes you feel safe. This will be your "safe place" that you can go to when a flashback or memory floods your brain. Imagine that safety, that feeling of relaxation and warmth all around you.  Mindfulness is a technique that helps you observe your emotions without heightened emotions, like judgement or shame. The principle of mindfulness is that you need to acknowledge and experience all of your emotions - even the negative ones - before you can let them go. Mindfulness is not easy because it means becoming aware of your negative self-talk. However, the task is to acknowledge and recognize those negative thoughts without getting caught up in or giving power to them Research shows that mindfulness-based therapy can facilitate self-acceptance.Try to find a quiet space to practice mindfulness. Sit in a relaxed position and focus on your breathing. Count the inhales and exhales. Your mind will wander. Let it. Take note of what you are feeling. Don't judge it; just be aware of it.By acknowledging but de-centering your thoughts and not letting them take over, you are learning how to cope with negative feelings without actually trying to change them. In other words, you are changing your relationship to your thoughts and feelings. Some people have found that in doing this, eventually the content of their thoughts and emotions changes (for the better) too., Be generous with yourself as you navigate your way through changing your perspective on who you are and boosting your self-esteem. Research has suggested that self-compassion has numerous benefits, including mental well-being, increase life satisfaction, and decreased self-criticism, among others. The road to transformation, particularly after a trauma, is not a straight, perfect path. You will have good days and bad days. Remember that doing your best does not mean being perfect, feeling perfect, or acting perfectly. Doing your best means doing the best you can in context of how you are feeling in that moment.Healing is a process that has ups and downs. If you are having a difficult moment or day, then acknowledge it without shame or guilt. Engage in some gentle self-care. Give yourself a break, lay on the couch, watch TV or read a book, rest your body and mind by taking a soothing bath, doing gentle stretching or yoga, getting extra sleep, and nurturing yourself. Come up with a mantra or habit that you can draw on when you feel an emotional spiral about to happen. Try putting your hand on your heart and saying, "May I be safe and kind to myself. May I have ease of both mind and heart."  

make yourself feel safe.  be assertive.  focus on the positive.  combat negative thoughts.  actively replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts.  take care of yourself.  do things you enjoy.  help others and give back.  engage in relaxation techniques.  practice mindfulness.  be kind to yourself. 

 Use a sharp pointed knife to cut out a heart shape over a cutting board. The heart should take up the majority of the tortilla. The smaller that you cut the heart, the smaller your quesadilla will be., You should only brush one side of the tortilla so that the other side of your quesadilla is dry and cool enough to be eaten with your hands. If you don't have a cooking brush, you can use a napkin, paper towels, or your hands to spread olive oil over the surface of your tortilla., Lay your bacon onto a hot skillet and cook each side for 7-8 minutes or until it becomes crispy and brown. If you like crispier bacon, allow it to cook for a minute or two extra on each side before taking it out of the pan. Set your bacon aside in a bowl lined with a paper towel.  You will only need to cook one side of each piece of tortilla that you have. The heat generated from cooking that side of the tortilla will melt the cheese once you sprinkle it over the tortilla., Use a knife to cut into the Primula cheese. Primula cheese is a soft Norwegian cheese that's easily spreadable.Spread the cheese over the cooked side of the tortilla.   If you can't get Primula cheese, you can replace it with another soft spreadable cheese like Manouri, Brie, or Brillat-Savarin., Remove your bacon from the bowl that you set aside and place it over the tortilla covered in cheese. Line up the apple slices so that there's an even distribution over the tortilla., Place the other tortilla cooked side down and press down on your quesadilla. Allow it to cool for another minute before serving it. The soft cheese and bacon will add a smoky saltiness, so no seasoning is required.  

cut your tortilla into a large heart shape.  brush one side of each tortilla.  fry bacon on the stovetop.  fry the tortilla on the stovetop on high until brown.  spread the primula cheese over the tortilla.  put bacon and apple slices over the cheese.  place another tortilla over the top and serve. 

 By mastering these fundamentals of basic steadying technique, you should be able to hold your sights that steady in any position.   Practice different positions to find what works best and is most comfortable for you. The seated position, comfortable for some, is uncomfortable for shooters with bad hips. If you're right-handed, your "firing hand" will be your right hand and your "non-firing hand" will be your left hand, and vice versa. However, eye dominance also plays a factor. Generally, with shoulder-fired weapons, you line up on the side of the dominant eye. This is even true for cross-dominant shooters — people who are left or right handed and dominant in the opposite eye.; , The rifle's hand guard should rest in the "V" created by your thumb and forefingers. The grip should be light, like a bad handshake, and the wrist should be straight with the fingers curled naturally around the handguard.   The non-firing hand should keep the rifle steady as the non-shooting hand in basketball should steady the ball. Most of the support of the rifle should come from your firing hand and your position, but the non-firing hand is for steadiness. Take precaution to always keep this hand clear of the rifle's action and ejected shells.  Make sure the butt is steadied against your shoulder, not the fleshy part of your armpit beneath it, or on your collarbone.   Keeping it firmly in this pocket allows the recoil to be absorbed by your whole body, rather than snapping back into your shoulder, making for a painful and inaccurate shot.  Depending on the kind of rifle you're firing, you'll be gripping either a full pistol grip or a tapered shotgun-style grip. Regardless, your grip on it should be more firm than your non-firing hand, more like a business handshake. There should be some backward pull on the grip, pulling the rifle back firmly into your shoulder. This ensures that, when you're ready to fire, squeezing the trigger won't move the rifle and jostle your accuracy.   Your trigger finger should be straight. Do not curl it around the trigger until you're ready to fire. Rest it on the side of the trigger guard, or use it with the other fingers to grip the stock.  Your elbows will be placed somewhat differently depending on whether you're seated, standing, or prone, but all positions require that your elbows stay under the rifle to support its weight. Imagine a string connected your elbows toward your hips, pulling them in toward your center of gravity.  This is sometimes called "cheek to stock weld," and can be obtained by bringing your nose to the charging handle on some rifles. Consistent cheek-to-stock weld will ensure that your eye aligns naturally to the sight and that you don't have to use your peripheral vision to strain and aim.  With proper technique, you should be able to relax your body and assume a calm breathing rhythm. Your grip should be firm on the rifle without being tense. If you're using your muscles to hold the rifle, eventually they'll tire and your accuracy will waver. Getting into a comfortable, relaxed position is the best way to shoot accurately.  Having oriented yourself in the general direction of the target and relaxed in a steady position, your rifle should be oriented mostly on-target without much more effort on your part. This is called your "natural point of aim" and is a sign of proper technique.   If, when you relax your muscles in your steady position and let your cheek weld to the stock, you have to expend effort to twist your body around even slightly to get the sight directly on target, this is a sign you need to reposition yourself. Abandon your position and realign yourself properly.  A basic aperture-sighted rifle (i.e., there's no scope on the rifle) – often called "iron sights" – consists of two parts, a front sight post or "bead" near the tip of the rifle's barrel and an aperture or "crook" about halfway up the barrel. Before you worry about your target, you need to align the bead in the crook to ensure that the rifle is "sighted." Any error here in alignment multiplies exponentially when the bullet leaves the gun.   If you've got good cheek-to-stock weld, the sighting post should align in the aperture without much difficulty. Reposition your neck slightly if you need to. If you're using a telescopic sight, the principle will be essentially the same.Make sure that your eye is the proper distance back from the scope, far enough to avoid recoil and aligned properly so there are no "shadows" in the scope's vision. Make sure your scope is properly sighted before firing and that your front sight post is blackened and matte, not reflective. Use gun blacking or pencil lead to blacken.  Align your eye with and focus on the front sight post. When you're trying to balance your elbows on your knees and breathe evenly and keep the stock tight and keep a little bead in a little aperture on a tiny target 50 yards (45.7 m) away, it can get frustrating: What do you even focus on? The short answer is the bead, not the target. Trust that you're in the right position, relax, and focus on the bead.   If you're in proper position and you've aligned the sight, your target should be in the aperture, and though it will appear blurry to you, focusing on the bead ensures that you maintain proper sight alignment while firing, resulting in a more accurate shot picture.  A correctly aimed shot has the front sight post, the aperture, the target, and your eye aligned perfectly (or if using a scope, the crosshairs and the target). This is called a "sight picture." Take a second to shift your focus back and forth between the target and your sight, ensuring that everything is aligned.   Eventually, the more you practice your aim, you'll be able to do this without changing your focus, which tends to strain the eyes. Practicing cheek-to-stock weld and sight alignment will ensure that your eye doesn't have to work too hard when aiming.  But it's important to breathe naturally and fully. Holding your breath will cause discomfort and inaccurate shots. In your breathing, learn to notice the moment immediately following an exhale, when you've completely emptied your lungs of air, but before you become uncomfortable and need to take a breath. It's a split-second, but it's the steadiest and most perfect moment to squeeze the trigger.  All of your careful alignment and positioning will be undone if you yank on the trigger like a gear shift. Instead, you want to squeeze the trigger as if you were bringing your finger to your fist, completing the firm business handshake you've got on the grip with a gentle squeeze.   Early on, anticipating the report and recoil of the rifle causes many shooters to wobble when pulling the trigger. It's a lot to keep straight at once, but getting comfortable your rifle is the only way to shoot accurately. Take lots of time setting up your shots and learn to relax. That groundwork will pay off.  Just like in basketball or golf, the proper positioning and balance needs to continue all the way through the shot. Jerking your head up to see whether you hit the target is the best way to miss it. Keep your muscles relaxed, your cheek welded to the stock, the butt tight to your shoulder pocket, and keep your eye focused on the front sight post. Take a few breaths and you're ready to either check your shot or fire again.  Make a line with your non-firing leg and elbow that points about 25 - 30 degrees to the right of your target. Shoulder the rifle in the crook of your firing shoulder so your natural point of aim falls on your target. Keep the butt high enough in the shoulder so your head stays upright as if you were standing. Use your left hand to bring the rifle up to the target level.   The prone position is the most stable of all standard firing positions because the shooter's elbows and the weight of the rifle are supported by the ground. You can also use a bipod, sandbag, or other steadying device in this position. Be careful of your hot shell casings. Since you're prone, hot spent casings can roll against your skin or fall onto your body, but this applies to shooting from any position.  In this position, you'll sit cross-legged, oriented 90 degrees toward to the target. Rest your elbows on each knee to support the rifle stock, keeping your back as straight as possible to improve your accuracy.   This position is very comfortable for some shooters, but is effected significantly by breathing. Maintain good breath control when firing in this position.  Keep your non-firing hip pointed at the target. You want to distribute the weight of the rifle over both feet evenly to ensure the most accurate shot, so keep your elbows down, your weight balanced on your hips.   Securely support the rifle by forming straight column of support with your body. The rifle should balance comfortably atop your body, requiring only minimal muscle use from you.  Professional shooters use something called a "kneeling roll" to brace the ankle of the firing-side leg, but you can also use a rolled up t-shirt or other brace. Kneel over your brace, keeping your bracing ankle on the firing side straight and the non-firing knee vertical. You can rest the non-firing elbow on your non-firing knee, or use the kneeling position as a modified standing position and keep it up. Either way, keep your elbows and in and down, supporting the weight of the rifle.   If you do rest your elbow on your knee, make sure you avoid unstable "bone-to-bone" contact. Instead brace the "meat" of your arm against your knee. Try placing your knee against your left tricep an inch or two above your elbow, then making minor adjustments to find the stablest, most comfortable position for you.  

develop your steady position.in the army, soldiers who pass basic marksmanship are expected to hold their rifle steady enough to keep the front sighting post straight even if a hammer falls on the barrel.  steady the handgrip with your non-firing hand.  put the rifle butt firmly in the pocket of your firing shoulder.  grip the pistol grip with your firing hand.  keep your elbows down and in.  relax your neck and let your cheek fall naturally to the stock.  relax your body.  check your natural point of aim.  align the rifle sight.  focus your eye.  check your sight picture.  control your breathing.shooting is a skill of millimeters, and you'll notice how much your breath affects your aim as you train your sights.  squeeze the trigger.  follow through.  fire from a prone position.  shoot from a seated position.  shoot from the standing position with your feet shoulder width apart.  fire while kneeling. 

 There are two basic categories of ADHD medication: stimulants (such as methylphenidate and amphetamine) and non-stimulants (such as guanfacine and atomoxetine). Hyperactivity is treated successfully with stimulant medication because the brain circuitry being stimulated is responsible for controlling impulsivity and improving focus.Stimulants (Ritalin, Concerta, and Adderall) help regulate neurotransmitters (norepinephrine and dopamine). These medications can be short-acting or longer-acting. This means that the effects of the medication can last a short period of time, which can be useful for individuals who can manage their ADHD most of the time, or some medications can last throughout the day.Non-stimulants boost norepinephrine, a chemical in the brain that seems to help with attention span.These types of medications are longer-lasting as well.  Stimulants have fairly common side effects of decreased appetites and trouble sleeping. Sleep issues often can be resolved by lowering the dosage.   Your child’s psychiatrist or pediatrician may also add a prescription to improve sleeping such as clonidineor melatonin. For children ages 4-5, the primary treatment approach recommended is behavioral modification and parent training, with the option to use methylphenidate if behavioral techniques do not fully manage symptoms.Combination of behavioral therapy is recommended along with medication for all age groups, Non-stimulant medications may work better for some persons with ADHD. Non-stimulant anti-depression medications are often used to treat ADHD. These help regulate neurotransmitters (norepinephrine and dopamine).   Some of the side effects are more worrisome than others. For instance, youth taking atomoxetine must be monitored closely for the potential of having suicidal thoughts. Some side effects for guanfacine include sleepiness, headache, and irritability., Deciding on the right form, dosage, and specific prescription of medication is tricky because people respond uniquely to different medications. Work with your child's doctor and the most recent research to find the right form and dosage for your child.   For example, many medications can be taken in an extended-release format, which eliminates the need to deal with dosing at school. Some individuals decline regular usage of medication, taking it only in situations when they need the medication. In these cases, individuals want a fast-acting version. For older children who learn to compensate for their ADHD challenges, medication may become unnecessary or be reserved for using during special occasions, such as when taking college entrance exams or finals.  Children will probably need extra reminders and assistance in order to take their medication regularly. A weekly pill container can help parents keep track of medications.If you child is taking stimulant medication, it is highly recommended that parents control medication storage and monitor its use because the DEA classifies stimulants as having a high abuse potential.  The medication’s effectiveness may change depending on certain factors. The effectiveness may change depending on growth spurts, hormonal fluctuations, diet and weight changes, and how fast your child's resistance to the drug builds up.  

ask your child’s doctor mental health professional about medications.  monitor side effects from stimulants.  ask about non-stimulant medication.  find the right medication.  use a pill container.  check in with your child’s pediatrician periodically to assess the prescription. 

 GIMP is a free image manipulation software, but Photoshop and other advanced image editing programs will work, too, with very similar methods.; , If the color you're matching is already in a picture saved on your computer, you can use that image. If you're trying to match a color on a webpage or computer program, you can take a screenshot that contains the color you're trying to match. , It looks like an eyedropper. , Locate the hex code - referred to as "HTML notation" - in the "Change Foreground Color" window that pops up.   You can also select "Use info window" from the left-hand side color picker menu. Then, when you click your chosen color with the picker, the color info window will pop up, and the hex code will be listed there.  You can note it down, or right-click on the code and copy it to your clipboard. Then you can use that code in the font color, background color, or other elements in the HTML or CSS project you're creating.

 Before you go on attacking the board by matching cropsies on it, analyze what’s in store for you first. Identify the different cropsies and items available and how they all relate to each other and your goals for the level.  Most goals will require you to collect certain number of cropsies. You need to match similar cropsies with at least three in a row or column to collect them. Swap cropsies on the board in order to get your matches. Match four or more similar cropsies in one go to get more bonuses.  You can multiply the cropsies you collect by adding bonuses or multipliers to them. Matches made beside cropsies will increase their multipliers. Match cropsies with multipliers to collect them. Be sure to collect cropsies with high multipliers before moving to a match elsewhere so that you won’t lose them.  Do not simply match any similar cropsies. You will just be wasting your moves on them. Focus on the ones that add to your goals. Save your moves so that you can get more points when you enter Hero Mode later on.  If your level has space in the bottom, focus your matches in this area. There’s a likely chance that you will get cascading matches made by cropsies falling from the top. 

study the level.  match cropsies.  multiply cropsies.  focus on the cropsies you need.  do cascading matches. 

 Long hair can "drown" shorter women. A hairstyle that stops above the shoulder prevents a woman's locks from overwhelming her stature.  If you prefer or must wear long hair, consider putting it back in high ponytails, buns, and other up-do's. Hair styled several inches above the head adds inches to your height.  Long, straight hair that hangs down in a single layer has the most overwhelming effect. Adding choppy layers or highlights breaks up the monotony of long hair, which may help prevent it from dwarfing you.  Whether you choose half-inch heels or three-inch heels, these shoes add height and make you look taller. Opt for skinny heels over thick ones, since skinny heels are more effective in creating a slender vertical appearance while thick platforms can make your feet look weighted and heavy.  Showing more skin on your foot is a simple way to extend the appearance of your height. The more skin an observing eye notices on your leg, the longer your leg will seem. The longer your leg seems, the taller you look.  Ankle straps cut your leg off with a horizontal line at the top of the foot, reducing the length of your leg as well as the appearance of height.  A deep v-neck keeps the eye looking up and down, while crew necks, scoop necks, and other horizontal necklines draw the eye side to side.  A hemline that stops at the knee or above it looks flattering on women of short to average height. Showing more leg makes your legs look longer, which maximizes the illusion of height.  Think A-line skirts and boot-cut jeans. Styles that flare out at the knee or lower leg help balance out the natural width of your hips. Tapered styles may make you look top heavy which, in turn, can make your legs look shorter. Shorter-looking legs may make you look shorter overall.  If you plan on wearing a dress with bare legs, consider a nude shoe. Alternatively, if you plan on wearing dark-wash jeans or black slacks, try a black shoe. Keeping your shoes and leg coverings in the same color range makes it more difficult for the eye to distinguish where the leg ends and the foot begins, making your leg look longer as a result.  The eye naturally assumes that the leg starts at the waistline. By having a waistline that rests above your hips, you help your legs look longer, helping you to look taller. For this reason, you should also avoid low-rise pants that may only make your legs look shorter.  A skinny belt tied around your natural waist can help define your figure, and may look flattering. A wide belt will define your figure, but the heavy horizontal line will also divide you in half and cause you to look shorter, rather than taller.  Try long scarves and necklaces that drape down your front. These pieces draw the eye up and down, causing it to take in your entire height.  Bulky shoulder bags and fanny packs cause you to look wider at the waist and hip. Anytime you cause the eye to take in width, you reduce the amount of height it takes in. Small clutches and tiny shoulder bags on narrow straps are much better alternatives.  

keep it short and sassy.  put your hair up.  add layers or highlights to your locks.  wear heels.  stick with open-toed shoes or sandals.  avoid shoes with ankle straps.  look for blouses with deep, vertical necklines, like the v-neck.  shorten your skirt's hemline.  stick with skirts and pants that keep your legs looking balanced.  keep your legs the same color as your shoes.  wear high-waisted bottoms.  stick with skinny belts over thick belts.  opt for long, draping accessories.  avoid over-sized bags. 

 As soon as you win your regional/state/local bee that ensures you are going to Washington, D.C., begin studying. Make a plan to study for a few hours a day, every day up until you go to Washington.; ,   Online: Many good resources such as spelling games, words of the day by email, and other free spelling and vocabulary study tips are free online. One good resource is spellingbeeprep dot yolasite dot com (add together) On your profile (spellingbee.com), learn all the words in the Rounds Two and Three study guides. It is a lot of words, but they will be given during those rounds and it would be bad to be eliminated from competition on a word that was on the study guide! In Print: There are only a few companies that sell spelling products, but the ones that do are expensive. If you are going to invest in one, be sure it's good. Look at the website listed above under "Study Tips" for a full list of good books by Hexco and other companies.  Scripps requires a Champion Bio and press release forms and such to be mailed to them. Usually the deadline is March 27th, so don't dilly-dally!  , Relax, and take breaks. If you overwork your brain, you will not learn the information.  If all you are doing is studying yourself, you will not be prepared to tackle random words you are given orally in the Spelling Bee.  Keep going! Every minute you don't study decreases your chances of making semifinals, finals, or whatever your goal is.  Don't keep yourself locked in your room all week studying. Study some, but realize that the chances of coming across a word that will appear in the Round One Test is very unlikely from a list you made.       Relax. Before the big computer tests, eat a good breakfast and try to go to bed early.       Eat healthy foods, but it's OK to have some sugar at the barbecue, as long as it's not too much. You don't want to have a sugar rush during competition!        

study, study, study.  find resources.  fill out your required information online, and the forms to mail.  don't overstudy.  get a partner to quiz you on words.  don't be discouraged.  during bee week:  enjoy yourself! 

 There's no "right" amount of salt to use here — just use more or less depending on how much glue you need to remove. Regular table salt works great, but you can try this method with sea salt, kosher salt, or another type of fine-grain salt as well. Avoid harsh, coarse salts like rock salt, which can cut up your hands.   If you're unsure how much to use, start with two tablespoons and add more as needed.; , Adding about half as much water as you added salt should make a loose, salty paste. Stir the salt and water together in your hand (or a separate container) to get it uniform.   Warm water works best. Warmer temperatures speed up the reactions that help break down glue at a chemical level.For a particularly tough job, try adding lemon juice instead of water. The acid in the juice helps dissolve the glue., Use one hand to rub it into the glue-covered area on the other hand. If both hands have glue on them, rub them together with the paste in between. Use constant, gentle pressure to work the salt into the glue. As you rub, it will gradually cause the glue to break up and peel away.   After about a minute, rinse some of the salt off and see whether the glue seems to be coming off. If the glue has all washed away, you're already done! However, it will usually take a few more applications before you make significant progress.  As you continue rubbing, you'll gradually lose the paste (which can make it a good idea to do this over the sink. Continue adding salt and water to keep the paste's loose but abrasive consistency. Depending on how thick the glue is, you may want to have several applications of salt measured out ahead of time.  Keep rubbing the salt paste in, rinsing bits of glue away, and applying more salt paste. Eventually, you'll be able to remove much of the glue. You may not be able to get all of it off the first time you try, but repeated applications will definitely speed up the process.   Even if the glue doesn't come off right away, don't worry — it will eventually fall off on its own. The natural oils in your hands will loosen the glue over time and it will fall off through your normal daily actions. It's rare for super glue to stick to the skin for more than about two days. 

put a little salt in your hands.  add water to make a paste.  rub the paste into your hand for about a minute.  add more salt and water as needed.  repeat until the salt is gone. 

 Prepare for the worst by developing a fire escape plan and making sure everyone in your household knows what to do in case of a fire. Your plan should identify all available exits from each room and routes that lead from the room to a safe, open-air space. Designate a meeting space away from your house, such as a neighbor’s yard or a mailbox across the street.It’s important that your exit routes do not lead to a closed-in area that would prevent escape away from your home, like a gated courtyard. It’s best that any gates or fences can be easily unlocked or unlatched from inside.Make sure everyone in your household knows how to unlock or unlatch any doors, windows, gates, or fences. Routinely inspect any and all of these potential obstacles to be sure they will actually provide a means of escape in the event of a fire. Practice your plan every few months, including at night, which is when fires are most deadly since it’s more difficult to find a safe exit.; , When making an escape plan, take any handicaps or abilities into account. If you or someone in your household depends on glasses or hearing aids and will need them in order to find their way out, make sure they’re always on a nightstand or other handy spot. Make sure wheelchairs, canes, and other means of mobility assistance are by their user’s bed or easily accessible.It’s best for anyone with mobility issues to sleep on the ground level of a multi-story home. Contact your local fire service’s non-emergency number and tell them about anyone in your household with special needs that should be kept on file., Stay as low to the ground as possible while you swiftly make your way to the nearest exit, especially if there is smoke in the area you’re located. Smoke inhalation can cause you to lose consciousness, and the freshest air will be closest to the ground since smoke and toxic chemicals rise. In addition, staying low below smoke will increase your ability to clearly see your escape path., Never open a door if the doorknob feels hot. That means there’s most likely a fire behind it, and opening the door will put you in danger and fuel the fire with oxygen. If your primary means of escape is blocked by a hot doorknob or other obvious sign of fire, find an alternate route or a window.Use the back of your hand to feel doorknobs, rather than your palm. The thinner skin on the back of your hand is more sensitive to heat, so you’ll notice heat before getting burned. Open any doors you come across slowly and be prepare to quickly shut it in case you encounter fire or smoke.  Even if you’re scared, it’s most important never to hide under a bed, in the closet, or anywhere else during a fire. If you hide during a fire, firefighters or other responders won’t know where you are. Try not to panic, and do your best to remain calm and make your way to the nearest way out of your house., If all possible exits are blocked, it’s important that you do everything you can to let any emergency responders know where you are. If you have a phone handy, call emergency services to let them know your exact location. Yell for help, shine a flashlight at a window, or find a light colored cloth or clothing item to signal out the window.   If you are stuck in a room, cover all vents, close the door and put a towel, clothes, or anything on hand that can suitably cover any cracks around it. This will help keep smoke and fire from entering the room.  

have an escape plan and practice it.  plan around the abilities of everyone in your household.  stay low and crawl to an exit to avoid smoke inhalation.  feel doorknobs to see if they’re hot.  don’t hide in the event of a fire.  know what to do if your escape routes are blocked. 

 In addition to “regular” snacks like cheese and crackers, look for simple recipes that reflect the cuisine of a particular region, country or setting in the book. For example, if the story was set in Italy, you might serve bruschetta and Italian wine.Additionally, you could emphasize the theme of your club meeting by including some decor that evokes a character or setting from the book.For instance, if you’re reading Alice in Wonderland you could purchase some themed items (including coasters, candles, or decorative art) that refer to Alice and her adventures around the meeting space. Don’t forget to offer some beverages to help wash down the snacks. Wine, water, coffee, tea, and soda are the easiest options.  After deciding on the theme, ask for suggestions from book club members regarding what snacks they’d like, if any. If your meeting does not have a specific theme, simple snacks like crackers, cookies, and crisps are popular options.Some book clubs are happy without snacks of any kind. Others leave it to each group member to bring their own snacks. Still others leave it to the host to prepare snacks or hors d’oeuvres. When hosting a book club, be sure to ask about food allergies and dietary preferences before preparing a snack.  Instead of selecting a specific book-related theme for your book club meeting, you might want to introduce general book-centric paraphernalia to set the mood. If you’re hosting the club in your home, there are many options available for sprucing up a regular living room or other space with book club-themed items.For instance, you might be able to obtain pillow covers or pillows embroidered with images of books. You could place some bookish art (such as art printed on book pages or paintings of people reading) around the meeting space.  

select a theme for the book club.  find out what sort of snacks your group wants.  include some general book-themed decor. 

 If your child gets freaked out by taking a bath, it can help to create a ceremony or ritual around the task to help ease your child's concern and make bath-time more enjoyable.   For instance, add bubbles, colored salts, or bath glitter to make the water fun and less intimidating. Use special soap or shampoo in your child's favorite color or scent. Doctor also advise giving smaller children massage-like baths involving gentle kneading as you wash to promote relaxation and increase the bond between you and your child. In addition, create a ritualistic event surrounding bath-time. Beforehand, you might enjoy a nighttime snack. Then, afterwards, you might read a bedtime story. Sandwich the undesirable activity in between two enjoyable ones so that your child comes to expect it as part of the daily ritual., Tell your child about how much fun they’ll have after they learn to swim. Point out that their older siblings or other children they look up to enjoy swimming, too.For instance, say something like, “If you learn how to swim now, you’ll be able to play with your cousins at the lake this summer. Won’t that be fun?”  , Toys can lure even the most reluctant kids into the pool or the bathtub. Consider getting a variety of toys that your child can play with as their swimming skills progress.Floating toys like boats and balls are good choices for beginners, while colorful rings that sink to the bottom of the pool can help kids learn to swim underwater.  Sometimes a little outside incentive can motivate a reluctant child to do something they don’t like. Make bath time or a swimming lesson more appealing by promising your child a treat after they’re done.A sticker, a favorite snack, or some time doing a fun activity are a few good rewards you could offer.  Nervous kids need a lot of reassurance, and praise is one of the best ways to help them feel more confident. Provide plenty of encouragement when your child tries something new or faces one of their water-related fears.Praise your child’s efforts instead of their ability. Say something like, “I’m really proud of you for putting your face in the water so bravely today!” Remind them that it's normal and okay to have fears. This is a great opportunity to teach your child to face fears with courage and intention.  

make bath-time a special occasion.  talk about swimming in a positive light.  find some fun water toys.  reward your child for facing their fears.  give your child lots of praise for their efforts.

 Talk to other recently married couples you know. They probably looked at a number of vendors in planning their own wedding. Ask your vendors as well—the wedding business is a tight-knit community, so your photographer might be able to recommend a really good chef, or the wedding dress shop might give you a referral for a great florist.  Shop around! Don't get set on any one vendor until you hear their prices and compare them to a couple others.  Find a balance between quality and price. Think carefully about how a more expensive detail will fit into the big picture of your wedding. Will anyone really notice real gold ribbons in the decorations? Sometimes it is best to just settle on a cheaper version and move on.  Your budget is an idea, but it is going to have to change as you start entering real dollar numbers.  

ask around.  call multiple vendors.  know when to settle.  alter your budget as needed. 

 The easiest way to avoid overdose is to follow the medication dosage provided by your doctor. Generally, you will start on a smaller dose, but your doctor may gradually move you up over time if you begin to develop a tolerance to the medication. Either way, sticking to the prescribed dosage should help you avoid an overdose.If you're unclear about how often you should take your medication, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.; , Don't try to change your dose on your own, even if you think the drug is not working. Always change dosages as advised by your doctor. If you up your dose on your own, you could risk overdosing. In addition, trying to wean off the drugs on your own could lead to major withdrawal symptoms. Any change in dosage should be under the advice of a doctor and closely monitored by your doctor., You should take your medication at the same time every day (if you take it every day), as varying when you take it could lead to accidental overdose. That is, if you take the drug at 10 pm one day and noon the next day (on a once-a-day schedule), there's not a full 24 hours between doses, and you'll have more in your system than you should.Also, you should only take benzodiazepines as often as your doctor or pharmacist says you can, especially if you are not taking them regularly. Taking them more often will up the amount of the drug in your system, which could lead to overdosing.  Taking other people's benzodiazepines can lead to overdosing, as you don't know how the medication will affect you. The medication affects different groups of people differently, and your doctor may start you out on a much lower dose of a medication than what another person is currently taking.   For instance, benzodiazepines, including drugs like alprazolam, can affect seniors more than other adults. Specifically, the half-life is longer for seniors than for other adults, meaning it stays in your system longer. Therefore, it's easier to overdose, as you may take too much based on what's already in your system.Teens taking benzodiazepines may have similar problems. It's important to only take these medications if they are prescribed for you by a doctor. In addition, elderly patients who are on benzodiazepines are more susceptible to falls and vehicle crashes.Another concern is obesity. The half-life of benzodiazepines can be longer in obese patients than in other patients.  Benzodiazepines may be prescribed by someone other than your primary doctor, such as a psychiatrist. For that reason, it's imperative that you tell them about all your medical conditions and any other medications you may be taking, so that they know what could affect your absorption of these drugs. For instance, if your liver is not functioning as it should, that could cause absorption problems. Similarly, if you have problems with your kidneys, that could also affect how you absorb these drugs.Some medications when combined with benzodiazepines can have an increased sedative effective, especially if absorption rates are affected. While not a disease, alcohol can also be problematic. If you drink alcohol regularly, that could change how you absorb these drugs, as well as make it easier to overdose. Avoid taking alcohol with benzodiazepines, or at the very least, be honest about your usage with your doctor.  If you miss a dose, you may automatically try to take the next dose. If it is not very long after you missed your dose, that's fine. However, if you're closer to the time when you would take your next dose, you should just wait and take your next dose, skipping the missed dose. Taking two doses too close together can lead to an overdose., These drugs are generally taken orally, though some are given intravenously in the hospital. Either way is safe, as long as it is under the direction of a doctor.However, some people who abuse the drug crush it and ingest it through the nose.One of the main problems with this method is you can easily take more than you intend to, which could lead to an overdose.   Similarly, you shouldn't inject the drug yourself unless instructed by a doctor, as this can make it easier to overdose., Even without overdosing, you can have other serious side effects. For instance, some people experience anterograde amnesia, which is when your brain has trouble creating new memories. In addition, many patients become dependent on these drugs as well as developing a tolerance, meaning they will want to continually take higher doses as time goes on. Talk to your doctor if you experience these symptoms.You may notice other side effects, including drowsiness, confusion, depression, vision problems, slurred speech, dizziness, and tremors. You may also notice stomach problems and dry mouth. In higher doses, you may notice mood swings and slower reflexes., This class of medications are used as tranquilizers that work on the central nervous system.They are used for things like anti-anxiety (such as diazepam, lorazepam, alprazolam, clorazepate, and chlordiazepoxide), muscle relaxation (such as diazepam), and sedation (such as estazolam, flurazepam, and temazepam).They can also be used to treat things like convulsions (using diazepam or clonazepam, for instance) or alcohol withdrawal (using chlordiazepoxide). In some cases, they can be prescribed to help with anesthesia, such as the drug midazolam. However, because of their depressant effects, they are often used recreationally, which can lead to overdosing.  People who use other drugs recreationally, such as methadone or cocaine, will often take a benzodiazepine to mitigate the side effects. However, if you do take this drug with other drugs, you're less likely to use caution when taking benzodiazepine, which in turn could lead to an overdose. It's best not to use any drug recreationally because of the potential problems., While taking benzodiazepines with other depressants may not seem like that big of a deal, it can make it easier for you to overdose. Many other depressants, such as opioid painkillers, barbiturates, and alcohol, are legal to take. However, they work in similar ways on your system (as sedatives), which could lead to an overdose.Make sure any drugs you take are under the direction of a doctor and that you take them as prescribed.  Overdosing can happen even if you've only taken the drug once, though it's unlikely if you are taking it under the direction of a doctor. Nonetheless, you should be on the lookout for short-term overdose symptoms, which include rapid breathing, rapid pulse (that's weaker than normal), clammy skin, and dilated pupils.If left untreated, you can go into a coma or even die from a benzodiazepine overdose.  Long-acting benzodiazepines (as opposed to short-acting benzodiazepines) can build up in your system over time because your body rids itself of the drug slowly. Specifically, it can build up in your body fat. This problem can occur even if you are taking your medication properly, but it is more likely to occur if you are taking more than you should every day for long periods. Regardless, you should watch for symptoms of sedation.You may find you're disoriented, confused, or feel groggy. You may feel klutzy or weak, and you might find you have slurred speech.  Seek emergency medical care if you are exhibiting signs of short- or long-term overdose. Go to the emergency room if you are exhibiting signs of short-term overdose, particularly if you used the drug with another drug or substance (such as alcohol), as that can make it more life-threatening., If a person is abusing benzodiazepines, they'll like seem detached or sedated from life. Because these drugs are depressants, they can make the person uninterested in what's going on around them, including avoiding social events and not seeming to care about their future.You should also check for these signs in yourself. If you find that you've stopped caring about your life and you don't even want to visit loved ones (and you're taking these drugs), it could be a sign of addiction.  Another symptom that can occur with benzodiazepine abuse is the person has intense mood swings, somewhat like bipolar disorder. Also, people who are abusing these drugs may experience panic attacks, as well as anxiety. If you notice a person's moods have changed (including your own), that could be a sign of abuse in conjunction with other symptoms., If someone is abusing these drugs, they are likely getting them from multiple sources, such as obtaining prescriptions from more than one doctor. You may notice more bottles around, a drop in cash flow, or an uptick in the number of doctor's visits.Other people may even fake the prescription, while still others may ask friends and family members for pills.You might also see bags of pills lying around, if the person got them from a dealer. If you find that you're trying to get these drugs on a regular basis from multiple sources, you may have a problem. Talk to your doctor or an addiction counselor for help.  People who abuse benzodiazepines often do so by mixing them with other drugs and depressants. For instance, taking the drug with something like alcohol or opioid painkillers will increase the effects of the drugs. However, because these drugs work in a similar fashion, it makes it much easier to overdose if they are mixed.Similarly, it's not a good idea to mix benzodiazepines with recreational drugs, such as cocaine or methadone. When mixing these drugs, you're less likely to pay attention to dosage, making it easier to overdose. 

stick to the recommended dose.  maintain your dosage.  pay attention to the appropriate schedule.  don't take other people's medications.  tell your doctor about all your medical conditions.  don't double-dose.  take the drug orally.  monitor side effects.  understand what benzodiazepines are prescribed for.  don't take benzodiazepines with other recreational drugs.  don't mix benzodiazepines with other depressants.  look for symptoms of short-term overdose.  watch for long-term overdose.  know when to seek medical care.  look for signs of detachment.  pay attention to mood swings.  check for multiple prescriptions.  notice if the drug is taken alone.

 Imagine what it'd be like with out them. Not to say that they pay for about everything for you. Understand that your parents are a huge part of your life and that they love you.   They feed you. Without your parents, you'd starve to death. They pay for toys, outings, birthday parties, and all those things you enjoy. Remember that everything costs money, and they're buying you this stuff because they love you. They pay for your education. Without knowledge, you'd be very dumb, and you'd never get a job. Also you'd probably never have met some of your best friends! You always have your parents to lean on. When you're sad, mad, or depressed you always know that your parents are there to cheer you up and help you get over a hard time. They give out advice. When you have questions, your parents are there to answer them. To your parents, there is no such thing as a stupid question. They sacrifice their time to spend time with you or take care of you. Some parents could be out having fun, but instead they're taking care of you. They pay for electrical bills, and give you a roof to live under, where you're always welcome. They simply love you.; ,   Make sure your parents know that you love them more than anything in the world.  Instead of letting your parents open doors for you, open it yourself. Don't always expect your parents to do everything for you. Instead start opening doors for them.   If you can do it yourself, your parents don't need to do it for you. If you have a pet, don't make your parents clean up after it! It's your pet, so it's your responsibility! Always clean up after yourself, whether it's putting your stuff back when you're done, or picking up your plates.  Such as wiping the table after dinner, or vacuuming the carpet.   Always clean your room, and do your homework without a fight. This will impress your parents.  If your sibling started it, tell your parents that.   If you started it, Tell your parents the truth. Parents like honesty.  Get good grades, study hard, and never get a phone home. Your parents will see that you're trying to succeed, and will respect that.   Do not start fights. Ask your parents any questions you have about your lessons. They went to school too.  This can range from just going out to breakfast, or seeing a movie together. Use this time to talk and catch up on each other's lives.   Don't talk all the time! Let your parents talk too!  , Nobody likes a liar. And if you lie, Your parents will stop believing everything you say.   If you do lie, Tell your parents. This may not help your punishment, but it'll show your parents that you care about them enough to tell the truth.  If you want a pop, say "Mom (Or Dad) Could you please get me a pop", not "Hey lady what does it take to get a pop around here?". Always say please and thank you.   Say excuse me when you burp or fart.  This could be a homemade gift, movie tickets, or just a smile, hug or kiss, and an "I love you".   Never forget your parents' birthdays, Mothers or Fathers Day! Even moms and dads enjoy a Christmas present under the tree with their name on it!  , It seems cheesy but it can really brighten your parents' day!  , If they don't want to say, respect them and say "OK, I love you".  

make a list of all the things your parents do for you.  tell your parents that you're truly sorry about how you've treated them, and you're going to change.  start being more independent.  do things that you don't normally do, or do them without being told so.  don't fight with your siblings.  do well in school.  spend time with your parents often.  be honest to your parents.  remember your manners.  give your parents gifts often.  remember to say "good night" and "good morning".  if your parents are having a bad day, ask why. 

 To humans, a hand closed into a fist is a gesture of hostility and aggression, while an open hand indicates friendship and trust. To your cat, these gestures mean the opposite.Moving towards your cat with an open, extended hand may alarm or frighten it, as she will associate this gesture with an aggressive attack.  Although this seems counterintuitive, it will establish affection between you and your cat.If you reach out with an open hand, your cat may think you are trying to grab at it or strike it.   To reassure your cat, brush your closed fist against it. Once it accepts the physical contact, you can start petting the cat as you normally would.  Reaching out with a fist will signal to your cat that you do not mean to harm it, but you should continue to treat your cat gently and affectionately after you have reached out to touch it.If you cuddle with your cat—let it sit on or near you, or lay in your lap and sleep—you’ll communicate that you can be trusted. If your cat had any initial misgivings as to whether or not you meant it harm, cuddling and petting your cat will reassure the animal that you mean well and will not harm it.  Bunting (a cat’s behavior when it rubs or butts its head against you) is also a sign of affection.Bunting marks you with your cat’s scent, and also expresses its happiness and trust in you.   Bunting can also show that your cat considers you a “safe” person to be around and indicates that it trusts you.Like slowly blinking, this is not a behavior you can train your cat to perform. Your cat will spontaneously bunt you once you have developed its trust.  Although this may seem silly at first, returning you cat’s bunt will indicate to the animal that you understand its significance and feel affection towards your cat as well.Tap and rub your cat lightly with your forehead or cheek, but remember to be gentle!   If you are playing with your cat, you can get down on your hands and knees so it can bunt your head directly. Bunting can also be an attention-seeking gesture. If your cat wants you to pet or play with it, it will bunt you to playfully get your attention. 

reach out with a closed hand.  touch your cat gently with your closed fist.  cuddle your cat after closed-fist contact.  allow your cat to bunt you.  return your cat’s bunt.

  Debt service is the amount of cash needed to pay interest and principal owed on a debt for a specific period of time.  It is usually calculated on an annual basis.  Businesses or individuals may need to know their total debt service when applying for a loan.An individual’s debt service might include a mortgage and student loans.     Debt service for companies includes the principal and the interest on outstanding loans.   An individual or company that cannot afford to make the payments is said to be “unable to service the debt.” ; ,  In most cases, your lender calculates your monthly payments when you are approved for a loan.  However, you can calculate the monthly payments yourself. You can search online for a payment calculator or do the equation by hand. To calculate monthly payments on a debt, first calculate the rate per month by dividing the annual interest rate by 12.  Then, calculate the monthly payment on each loan using the following formula: A=P/{\displaystyle A=P{/}}.   In this formula, A = amount per month, P = principal (loan amount), r = interest rate per period and n = total number of payments.For example, suppose you purchased a $21,000 car and you put down a $1,000 down payment. You need to borrow $20,000, so you take out a 60-month loan at an annual interest rate of 7.5 percent.   Calculate the interest rate per period (month) by dividing 7.5/12 = 0.625 percent per month.   Plug in the values to the formula: A=/{\displaystyle A={/}}.   In this example, the total monthly payment would be $400.76.  Begin by calculating the monthly payment for each of your loans. Total the monthly payments for all of your loans by adding all of the monthly payments together. Once you know your total debt service payments, you can calculate the debt service ratio.   For example, suppose in addition to the car loan for $400.76 per month, you have a mortgage payment for $823.45 per month and a student loan payment of $147.89 per month.     Your total debt service payments would be $400.76 + $823.45 + $147.89 = $1,372.10.

This undead fiend is on the 33rd floor of the ordeal filled cavern. This Poe can be spotted floating about on the 44th level of the cave.  Floating above those walls are Peahats. Clawshot your way from one to the next, but pausing on the third one. If you look to the south, you'll see a broken pillar with a tree growing out of it. Clawshot to the conveniently hovering Peahat, then drop down and defeat the Poe. This is located in the central area of the fourth floor, outside of the pillar room with the Big Key. You'll find yourself in a courtyard filled with Kargarocs and Lizalfos Knights, as well as a myriad of ropes that you must cross in your wolf form. Make your way around the tower via the ropes to a large platform. You should be able to recognize this platform by looking for the chest and the Poe on top of it.  Talk to the second Goron you come across to have him vault you onto the cliffs you see to the side of the main path. The Poe is hovering around this ledge. , This Poe will be flitting about near a large rock formation. This one can be found in the far corner near the Warp Point. Near the small enemy camp south of the Arbiter's Grounds (the really small one, with the campfire and boars), there's a rock formation with a tree atop it. Well, not really "near" so just hit the camp and then head west/east (Wii/Cube). Use the Clawshot to get to the tree, then follow the raised path to reach this Poe. See directions to the above Poe, then look for a circle of rocks and a large dig spot. There will be two Poe's in that grotto. See above. When you first enter the canyon leading to the Arbiter's Grounds, take one of the side branches to find this Poe (Right on the Wii and Left on the Cube). After defeating King Bulblin in the fort, return to the spot of the epic battle to find this Poe. This one is just to the side of the Arbiter's Grounds doorway.  Follow the balcony into the main street, then Clawshot to the netting. Now just follow this back to where you saw the Poe.  South of the path leading to Lake Hylia is a path that leads you to an old arena. This Poe waits at the bottom of the stadium seating. Enter Kakariko Gorge from Southern Hyrule Field, then head up the nearby hill and seek ye the Poe that floats near the tree. If you enter the Kakariko Gorge area from Southern Hyrule Field, you'll spot a wall with a suspicious boulder in front of it.

In Northern Hyrule Field is a large bridge spanning the river. The center of the bridge contains a Poe. In Northern Hyrule Field, cross the bridge and head toward the paths leading towards Castle Town. There's a circle of grass near one of the trees, and there's a dig spot there leading to a hidden grotto. Inside said grotto there are two Poe's you can defeat. See above. You can find this Poe on the overly large staircase just south of Castle Town. Enter Castle Town, then take the western/eastern (Wii/Cube) exit to find this Poe floating over a bridge. South of the Great Bridge of Hylia is a not as great wooden bridge. Go south of that wooden bridge and gaze up at the cliff. You'll spot some boulders, which you should use bomb arrows to blow up. Use the newly exposed Clawshot points to traverse the ledges until you reach a platform with this Poe.  Head to the tower you blew up while collecting Tears of Light earlier to find this Poe. From the previous Poe, follow the path up to the lookout tower's entrance to spot this one. You'll find this one floating around in the middle of the graveyard. Move one of the tombstones near the entrance of the graveyard to reveal this Poe.  From the Warp Point, take the southern bridge to the next ledge and climb the ladder. Follow this path to the tower and then dispatch the Poe. Head south of the Warp Point and cross the bridge, then climb the ladder. Along the wall at the top you should be able to spot a suspicious looking patch of wall. Bomb it and traverse the cave to find three Poe's. See above. See above. Near the waterfall at the edge of the lake is a patch of land. Swim out there and make landfall to find this Poe. Play Falbi's Flight by Fowl game and head toward the Isle of Riches, aiming for the third platform from the bottom. The Poe can be found hovering between there and the second platform. Talk to Falbi and agree to play the Flight by Fowl game. As soon as you leap off the platform, hold down on the controls and turn around. Now visible will be a platform underneath the cliff, which you should aim for. Once you alight on the small platform, dispatch this Poe.  Do so, then climb the ledges to find this Poe. In the area with the final confrontations with the Skull Kid, there's a boulder that you can bomb. Doing so will reveal a Poe. This one can be found floating around in the area where the Master Sword had been sleeping. This one is just outside the entrance to the Temple of Time, in the area that is in the past. Flanking the stairway to the present are two owl statues. Behind one of them is this Poe.  Head to the base of the mountain and cross the ice floes, then begin the ascent. This Poe is near some rocks pretty close to the base. On your way up the mountain you'll come across a clearing of sorts with two trees in it. One of the trees has a Poe floating near its branches. During the mountain climb, you'll find some ledges that need be climbed. After climbing them, there's a path off to one side that leads to a lone tree. Head to the tree and defeat the Poe. Just inside the mountain cave are two large things of ice. Break them with the Ball 'n Chain to reveal this Poe. From the entrance to Snowpeak Ruins, turn into a wolf and then head back toward the trail. Just outside of the gateway is a tall rock formation. After wending your way to the top you shall see this Poe.  In the entryway are twin lines of suits of armor. Smash them with your Ball and Chain to reveal this Poe. After you receive the Ball and Chain and pass through the foyer via chandelier, enter the next doorway. This room is full of ice and Freezards. Along one of the walls is a set of ice pillars that you can smash, and doing so reveals this Poe.  Follow the staircase onto the first balance, then toss statues as needed to reach the second balance. Toss another one onto the lower balance to raise the second more, so that when you're on top of it it won't lower. Climb onto the small pillar there, then Clawshot to the ceiling above the central gazebo. Follow the path, then use the Spinner to reach a ledge. This Poe will be floating around near the door leading to the Big Key. On the third floor is a large circular room, one with a platform that will raise or lower levels. Along the edge of the room is a Poe behind a gate. Use the Dominion Rod to move a statue onto the switch behind the gate (or just smash the gate with the giant statue, depending on when you're doing this) to reach the Poe.

 If you can see fat, muscle, or bone through your cut, or if the cut is wide and jagged, you will most likely need stitches. If you are unsure, you should check with a doctor or nurse.Signs that it is a problem needing quick attention can include any or a combination of the following: extreme pain, a lot of bleeding, signs of shock (such as cold, sweaty skin, feeling cold, or paleness of skin and appearance). You know a cut is through the skin if you can see fat (yellow-tan, lumpy tissue), muscle (deep-red, stringy tissue), or bone (tan-white, hard surface).However, any cut that is more than three centimeters long or 1/2 inch deep requires medical attention. If a cut does not go all the way through the skin, it does not need stitches, and can be cared for at home.; , If you believe your cut needs emergency medical attention, there are a few things you can do to care for the wound before traveling to the emergency room. Quickly rinse the wound under water to wash away any loose debris or dirt. Try to wipe any debris or dirt away from the injury site first with sterile gauze to ensure that the water does not wash the debris into the wound. Next, apply pressure with a clean cloth or bandage and continue to hold pressure as you get transported to the emergency room.   The wound will get cleaned again when you see your doctor to make sure it is thoroughly disinfected. If the wound is large and bleeding a lot, try to wrap the area with a towel or bandage, then continue to apply pressure.As you travel, try to position the wound above the level of the heart to reduce severe bleeding.  Don't remove any object that does not wash away easily. If glass or debris is lodged in the wound, you can do more damage by trying to remove it yourself. Also, do not attempt to sew or glue the wound shut, as household products can cause infection and/or prevent healing. Do not use rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or iodine to clean the cut, as it can slow healing., If possible, do not drive yourself, as it may be dangerous. If you are alone and bleeding seriously, it may be a good idea to call an ambulance.  

check the wound.  prepare a serious wound for travel to a doctor.  do not attempt to thoroughly clean the wound or seal the wound with household products.  get to your doctor safely. 

 Discuss and determine your relationship goals with one another. Being on the same page with each other about the future of your relationship, whether that is marriage or partnership, children, or simply cohabitation, will ultimately strengthen your relationship and sort out priorities.   If you both have different ideas of what your future holds, as in one of you wants a long-term cohabiting relationship and the other doesn’t, then it might be best to end the relationship sooner than later., Moving in together is a big step and many people take time to overcome their reservations about cohabitation. Acknowledge your boyfriend’s experience and desires and give him space and time to come around. Giving him his space to sort out his resistance will show your care and commitment to the relationship.   Avoid pressuring him into “wanting” to live together. Cohabitation is a big commitment and should be a mutual decision. Respecting your boyfriend’s space does not mean forgetting about moving in together. Be sure to set a time to return to the conversation after he’s had time to think about it.  Finances can control a significant amount of timing in a relationship. You may not be in a place financially stable enough to move out of where you currently live, or one of you might make significantly more than the other. Whatever the issue or imbalance, discussing your finances will help you both be on the same page about the possibility of moving in together.Lay out all of your financial information: credit score, credit card debt or student loans, income, assets, and other financial obligations.Discuss how the rent and bills will be divided. Remember, fair is not always equal.  

discuss your relationship’s future.  respect his space.  discuss finances. 

 Many companies have a zero-tolerance policy for interoffice romance. Make a point to familiarize yourself with written policies on fraternization. Your Human Resources department has these policies on file. , Consider your future goals and be clear to yourself about what your job means to you. If you are uncomfortable with the possibility that this rendezvous could end up negatively affecting your career, then it probably is not a good idea to pursue a one night stand with a coworker. Pros may include: having a one night stand with a person you're familiar with because you work together, having at least one thing in common (work) with the partner for the one night stand, and the exciting, “forbidden” nature of the affair. Some cons could be: one of you could end up being fired, things could become awkward at work between the two of you, work place gossip may spread, and your reputation might be tarnished.  Do not pursue the affair in order to escape your day-to-day work struggles. Today, many people are unsatisfied with their jobs, but this does not mean you should sleep with your co-worker who happens to sympathize with you; do not confuse sympathy with love or desire. Sympathy is an understanding or common feeling between people, generally in a negative context. For example, you can sympathize with someone who you do not even know because you share a common negative experience.Love is an intense feeling of affection or desire, where you want to get to know a person on a more intimate level.  If you do decide to pursue the affair, know your game plan. Consider the worst case scenario, and have an exit strategy if things go south. Think about whether you would be willing to quit your job, and have a possible back-up in case things end up badly. Before the one-night stand, you can prepare your exit strategy by doing the following:   Make sure your resume, website, or work portfolio is up to date. Contact colleagues and people you know from previous jobs for references and recommendations. Look into the company’s other departments or job banks online to see if there are job openings you can apply to, or register with a temp agency.  

familiarize yourself with your company’s fraternization policies.  weigh the pros and cons.  don’t confuse work place solidarity with desire or love.  have an exit strategy.

 You may not like to think about it, but your bathroom towel is one of the most bacteria-ridden items in your home. Bacteria grows on organic material and in damp places, making your bathroom towel a perfect breeding ground for the bacteria it collects from your skin. Spreading this bacteria can lead to skin infections and illness. Follow these steps to take care of your towels:Never share towels with other members of the household. Wash towels at least once per week or every 3-4 uses. If you are showering after athletics or a physically demanding job, wash them more often. Wash towels at high heat. Use bleach when possible to kill bacteria. Replace towels as soon as they begin to fade or smell musty.; , Squeeze the water out of your hair before stepping out of the shower. Avoid rubbing a towel on your hair, which could damage it and cause frizziness. Consider a separate towel for your hair. It is best to use a microfiber towel, or even a t-shirt. For long hair you can roll it into a turban.   Hold your head upside down. Place the long side of the towel along the base of your head at the hairline. Close the towel around your hair and gather it at the top of your forehead. Twist the towel until it has gathered all of your hair and shortened the length of the towel, usually two or three turns. Take this tail you have created over the top of your head and tuck the tail into the edge of the towel at the base of your head.  Aggressively rubbing your body with a towel can cause friction and irritation to your skin. Dry skin can flake off and patches of dry skin can spread. Instead, pat or blot your skin gently.Start at the top of your body and work your way down to your toes.  Harsh tap water can be damaging to the skin. The metals in the water attach to free radicals, which attack the collagen in our skin. This can be the cause of lines in your face and clogged pores.Make sure that you absorb as much as possible before you hang your towel up to dry. If you are concerned about hard water, you my also consider installing a filtration system in your shower.  Ointments and creams are superior to moisturizer and less likely to cause irritation. Just after showering is the best time to optimize this solution to dry skin.  

keep a clean towel handy.  dry your hair.  pat your skin dry.  make sure you are completely dry.  apply ointment or cream to lock in the moisture which was absorbed during your shower. 

 In order to provide adequate notice to terminate your lease agreement, you will need to know what type of tenancy you and the landlord have entered into. For residential rental agreements, the most common type of tenancy is a periodic tenancy. Periodic tenancies can come in many forms, but two of the most common forms include:    Month-to-month tenancies. A month-to-month tenancy is an arrangement in which the lease may be altered or terminated monthly upon proper notice.This type of lease offers a great deal of flexibility because of your ability to terminate the lease once every month.However, the landlord also holds a good level of flexibility and may be able to raise rent or change rental terms with the same minimal notice.Fixed term leases. Fixed term leases are rental agreements in which you agree to stay and pay rent for a fixed period of time, most often one year.In this situation, a renter who breaks their lease early may incur penalties for not staying for the agreed upon period., Your rental agreement may or may not include a termination clause. If it does, be sure to read and understand it because in most situations this will provide you with directions on how to terminate your lease.   If your rental agreement clearly sets forth the manner in which you should provide your landlord with notice, then follow those directions. For example, a lease agreement may state, "Tenant shall provide landlord with at least 10 days notice prior to vacating the premises." In this situation, you should provide your landlord with notice at least 10 days before you move out. If your rental agreement is silent regarding termination, you should follow your state's laws. For example, in Oregon, a month-to-month tenancy can be terminated by giving the landlord written notice not less than 30 days prior to the date you plan to move out.If you have a fixed term lease of at least one year in Oregon, you can terminate the lease by providing not less than 30 days notice prior to the agreed upon end date of the fixed term, or not less than 30 days prior to the date you designate in your notice letter, whichever is later.As you can see, in Oregon, at least 30 days notice is required. If you are in a month-to-month tenancy, you can terminate your lease at any time so long as you provide 30 days notice. However, if you are in a fixed term lease, you will not be able to terminate until the fixed term is up (unless you are willing to incur some penalty).  In addition to understanding how much notice you need to provide your landlord, you also need to understand how that notice needs to be delivered. If your rental agreement sets out the manner in which you must deliver the notice, then you must follow that language. If your lease agreement is silent, then you should follow your state's law.   For example, your rental agreement may state, "Any notice must be provided in writing and delivered in person and through first class mail to the address provided in this Agreement." Under this clause, you would be required to write your notice (i.e., not provide notice verbally) and deliver that written notice both in person to the landlord and through the mail. If there is no delivery clause, your state statutes will set forth the manner in which delivery must take place. In Oregon, you can choose to deliver your written notice either in person to the landlord or through the mail to the landlord.If you provide notice through the mail, the minimum notice requirement (e.g., 30 days) will be extended by three days.Therefore, in Oregon, if you deliver your 30 day notice through the mail, you will actually have to provide the landlord 33 days notice in order to account for the delivery time.  When you write your termination notice to your landlord, you need to address the letter properly. In order to do so, look at your lease agreement and find the landlord's official address. If it is not provided, call your landlord and ask how the letter needs to be addressed. If you cannot get a hold of your landlord, use the address you have for paying rent.   In most states, including California, a rental agreement is required to include an address where notices can be addressed to., Either before or after the landlord's address, you will include the date your notice is delivered. This ensures your landlord understands when your notice period will start.   For example, if you are required to provide 30 days notice in order to terminate your lease, and you date your notice August 1, 2013, which is when you personally delivered the notice to your landlord, you and your landlord will understand that the 30 day period starts on August 1, 2013.  The first body paragraph of your notice letter should state the reason you are writing the letter. This gives the landlord an idea of how they need to respond, if they need to respond at all.   You can write something as simple as, "I, John Smith, live at . I am writing to notify you of my intent to terminate the lease agreement between myself and you. I am providing the required 30 days notice, which will start from the day this letter is dated." In most states, you do not need to state any specific reason for your intent to terminate.It is sufficient to simply state that you are terminating your tenancy as required by law.  In addition to the date of delivery, the body of your letter should also state the date in which you will vacate the premises.This date will need to be some time after the required notice period is up.   For example, if you are required to provide 30 days notice and you delivered it on August 1, 2013, the date you will vacate will have to be August 30, 2013 or after. While you can certainly move out before the 30 days are up, you will be responsible for the rental unit, including rent payments, until the 30 days are up and you have vacated.  In another body paragraph, you should respectfully request that any refundable deposits (e.g., security deposit) be returned to you upon satisfactorily vacating the premises. In addition to requesting any deposits be returned to you, you should state all of the reasons you have complied with the lease agreement, and therefore why you deserve the deposits back.   For example, your security deposit is often returned to you so long as you vacate the premises on time and so long as you clean the premises as required before you vacate. If this is the case in your lease agreement, state that you plan on leaving on time and that you will clean the premises in a satisfactory manner. Your request may look something like this: "In addition to providing the required notice to vacate, I am also respectfully requesting that any and all refundable deposits be returned to me, in full, within the required period set forth under the law. Per our Agreement, I will clean the apartment, fix any damage, and will have the carpets professionally cleaned. In addition, I will vacate the premises on time and will return all keys to you as requested."  , Before you end the letter, be sure to give the landlord your new address. This new address is where your refundable deposit will be sent, as well as any notifications you may need to receive after you vacate the premises.  Once you have written the entire notice letter, you will want to sign it. This will make it official and help if there is some dispute between you and your landlord about the notice.  Once you have written the notice letter, make a couple of copies for yourself. If your landlord doesn't receive the notice, or there is some dispute about the notice, you will want a copy you can look back on.  After completing your termination notice letter, you will want to consider when to give it to your landlord. Remember, the notice period will not start until your notice is delivered to your landlord.   If you are in a month-to-month tenancy, you should deliver your notice letter along with your last month's rent. This will ensure that you provide the required 30 days notice and that you will have paid the last month's rent. If you have a fixed term tenancy, you should deliver the notice 30 days (or however long your state's notice requirement is) before the term is up. For example, if you signed a lease that ends on August 31, 2013, you should deliver your notice August 1, 2013. While you can give the landlord notice at any time during the rental period, if you give notice in the middle of the month you will be required to cover part of the next month's rent.For example, assume you have a month-to-month tenancy and you pay rent on the first of the month.You could give your notice on the tenth of the month but you would be required to pay rent through the tenth of the following month., After deciding when you want to deliver your notice, remember to look at your lease agreement or your state's laws and understand how you will have to deliver your notice. Make sure you follow the correct procedures to ensure your notice is valid.  Once you have delivered your notice, be sure you vacate the property on or before the date you specified in your notice letter.  

know what type of tenancy you have.  read the termination clause in your lease.  look for a delivery clause in your lease.  address the letter to your landlord.  date your notice letter.  state the purpose of your notice letter.  include the date you will vacate the rented space.  ask for any refundable deposits to be returned to you.  give the landlord your new address.  sign your notice letter.  make a copy of your notice letter.  choose when you want to deliver your notice letter to your landlord.  deliver the notice letter to your landlord properly.  move out by the required date. 

 Believe it or not, there is a recipe for pumpkin treats that you’ll love as much as your dog. You’ll need half a cup of canned pumpkin puree, one cup of whole wheat flour, a cup of quick cut oats, a tablespoon of coconut oil, an egg, and a quarter cup of Greek yogurt.In terms of spices to make these more palatable to humans, you’ll also need half a teaspoon of vanilla, one tablespoon of honey, and a teaspoon each of ginger and ground cinnamon. Pulse or otherwise blend the oats until they’re half powder.  In addition to preheating the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), you’ll also need to grease a muffin tin to bake your treats in. A mini muffin tin works best, and will yield more treats overall. After mixing all of the ingredients in a large bowl, thin the mixture with water until it’s malleable.Fill individual cups in the tin two-thirds of the way with the batter.  The muffins are finished when their tops are golden brown. For added aesthetic appeal, feel free to sprinkle oats on top of the muffins right when they come out of the oven.Allow the muffins to cool in the tin. Store your muffins in the fridge for a few weeks, or fin the freezer for up to three months.  Raw pumpkin seeds are also good for both you and your dog on their own. The seeds’ fatty acids may be especially beneficial for dogs with joint, skin, or coat conditions. Only give your dog one seed at a time, or crush them completely and add them to your dog’s food. 

prep a batch of multi-species treats.  prepare a muffin tin.  bake for about fifteen minutes.  snack on pumpkin seeds together.

 Empty the heating water just before adding the brewing water.  This is when the water begins to boil but has not yet begun to simmer. The temperature at this stage will be 160ºF (71ºC). Bitter brews come from too high a temperature of water on green tea; prefer a longer steeping time at a cooler temperature instead. , Let it steep for three to five minutes. Three minutes steeping results in light flavor, while five minutes will give you a robust, full flavor. The longer the green tea is left in, the stronger the taste, so you might like to experiment as to which taste works best for you.   For high grade tea such as "gunpowder" types, steeping time may be as few as 10 seconds on first brew. You can reuse the leaves several times, steeping slightly longer with each batch. It is advisable to allow the leaves to rest for a few minutes after the first two brews so as not to burn or overwork them. Always time the brewing and taste the tea rather than relying on color changes. Some green teas turn dark quickly but are not ready, while some stay light but are ready sooner than you may think.  It is now ready to be enjoyed.   In addition, Chinese green tea connoisseurs will also use a snifter cup to enhance the tea drinking experience. These cups are much smaller in diameter but longer in length to allow the scent to waft into the nostrils as you sip out of your main cup.  

preheat the teapot or kettle.  boil the water to "first boil".  place one rounded teaspoon of loose green tea or one teabag per cup into the teapot.  ,  pour over the boiling water.  pour into a sieve (to catch any loose tea, if you don't want it in your drink) over cups, mugs, or glasses. 

 Do kind, loving deeds for your partner. Consider buying a special gift for him/her and spend time doing things you enjoy together. Make the relationship mutually satisfying.; , Think about all their positive traits, even make a list of them if it helps. This might be anything from how physically attractive you find them to a good sense of humour.  Don't be rude, but definitely give the message that you are already taken.  Give them a phone call, or arrange to spend some quality face-to-face time with them. Use your attention on the one you really love.  

invest in your current relationship.  remind yourself of what you appreciate about your partner.  ignore someone who is flirting with you.  communicate with your partner.

 For years now, ginger has been giving the sick support with its nausea-fighting powers. Head for your pantry and grab some fresh or candied ginger. If you can handle the flavor of fresh ginger, eat it raw. Otherwise, try it candied or grate some into a cup of water to make tea.  When all else fails, plain crackers tend to do the trick for nausea. They have a mild flavor and are easy to digest, making them the perfect sick food. If you can handle crackers, try upgrading to pretzels which have a bit of a higher nutritional value.  Although it’s not everyone’s first ‘sick food’ to turn to, watermelon is actually great for helping out with a bout of nausea. The high water content and mild flavor help to settle your stomach and incorporate more fluids into your system. If you have a fever as well, try the fruit chilled for a soothing cooling effect.  White rice sans toppings isn’t the most flavorful dish, but it is helpful for combating nausea. The easy-to-digest carbs will give you a short boost of energy, while the simple flavor won’t irritate your stomach further.  Eating a barely ripe banana (more towards the green side, with no spots) is great for several reasons. The soft texture and mild flavor make it easy to digest, plus the fruit is full of potassium which aids your immune system in healing your body. Kill two birds with one stone, and mash your banana up with a cup of white rice.  Now, most dairy products are frowned upon during a period of nausea. However, yogurt with active cultures helps to supply your stomach with the good bacteria necessary for kicking out the bad bacteria. Therefore, find a simple yogurt flavor that advertises probiotics, and your stomach will be back on track in no time.  No butter, no jam, nothing. Plain (unburnt) toast has similar qualities to crackers. The bread is easy to digest and has a very mild taste, making it more likely that your stomach won’t fight against it. Try a single slice and see how you feel before taking another., Sticking to eating the aforementioned foods is best, but if you must eat other things, use your best judgment. Avoid eating any foods that are greasy, fried, spicy, or very sweet. These can all make an upset stomach much worse, and are more likely to trigger a spell of vomiting.  

have some ginger.  eat some crackers.  try watermelon.  eat plain rice.  have a banana.  scoop up some yogurt.  try plain toast.  avoid upsetting foods. 

 A big part of loneliness is mental and boredom. Stewing in your own thoughts and fixating on how lonely you are can exasperate the problem. Finding a new hobby is a great way to occupy your mind and to stop dwelling on your loneliness and funnel your energy toward something new and exciting. Many hobbies include other people but there are plenty of fun things to do alone. Try getting artsy. Even if you're not naturally artistic, something as simple as doodling or painting can calm your mind and divert your focus from your loneliness. Write. Whether it's a journal or a creative story, writing can be a great way to express your thoughts and to be creative. Take a free online class. With the rise of open online education, many major universities are offering free classes to anyone. Do a simple Internet search for "Massive Open Online Courses" (MOOC) and find something that piques your interest. Read. Reading is a great way to transport yourself to another world that leaves behind anxiety. Grab a book on your shelf you've never read. If you don't have any, run to your local library and grab some free books. Get creative! There are no limits on the fun activities you can do by yourself. You can learn to knit, work on puzzles or get outside to garden or hike.; , If you are feeling really alone, it's always great to lean on family. You won't feel so lonely anymore and you'll be able to talk to or see someone who is familiar with you and cares about you. Technology is great to reduce the feeling of distance. Whoever your closest family members are, ask them to webcam with you so that you can see their face and talk to one another just like you're in the same room.  You may not know anyone where you choose to volunteer, but it's a great way to help a cause and get around people. You can volunteer to help animals, teach people how to read, help out at a nursing home, or give your time to a soup kitchen.   Search a local newspaper or use the internet to find volunteer options in your area. A lot of shelters for animals or homeless people are constantly using social media and the internet to ask for volunteers. If you can't find anything, call a local animal shelter, library, or nursing home to inquire whether they need help.  Buying an animal is a huge commitment and responsibility, but also a great way to ease feeling lonely. Depending on your work and home life, you can choose the best pet for your lifestyle and expectations.  

pick up a new hobby.  get in touch with family.  get out and volunteer.  get a pet. 

 Dyscalculia can cause a lot of anxiety and self-esteem issues for children who suffer from the disorder. They may feel that they are unable to do math at all or that their peers are too far ahead for them to catch up with. Whenever you are helping a child deal with dyscalculia, you'll want to help ease any anxieties about math and help them see that they can overcome the difficulties of this disorder.It's a good idea to acknowledge how difficult math can be for the child and talk to them about dyscalculia. Offering praise whenever a child attempts to work on math assignments can reduce anxiety and boost self-esteem. Focusing on a child's strengths can be a good way to help them see that they have plenty of talents to be proud of.; , As you go about your day with a dyscalculic child, try to ask them basic questions about math or numbers. Keeping them engaged in this way will help them get in plenty of practice and become more familiar with mathematical concepts. Try some of these examples to help keep a child practicing and working to overcome their dyscalculia.If you pass a clock, you can try asking them what time it is. Try asking the child to count out exact change for you when buying something. If you're on a walk with the child, ask them to count things that you might see. For example, you can ask them to count the number of dogs in a dog park or how many cars are parked near you.  There are plenty of games that you can play with a dyscalculic child to help them practice and improve their math-based skills. Many of these games involve simple mathematical questions and will help expose your child to numerological concepts that they might be struggling with. Try looking over some of these examples of math based games for some fun ways to help your child deal with dyscalculia:Many board games will require you to count and move a certain number of spaces. You can play numerical matching games like dominoes or go fish. Games like Monopoly can provide some extra counting practice. There are many apps available the can help your child practice their math skills as they play.  Working with a dyscalculic child to complete their math homework can be a great opportunity to help them with their disorder. Offer plenty of positive feedback and let your child know what they get right. You should also try to point out parts they made a mistake on and allow them to make a correction. Stay positive and supportive as you work together to complete the assignment.Let the child make their own corrections. Ask them why they think a problem needs correcting and how they plan on fixing it. Ask your child about their reasoning behind their solutions. Even if an answer is wrong, keep positive and help your child make any necessary corrections.  Many schools will be happy to work with your dyscalculic child and their needs. Schools may also provide neuropsychological evaluation to diagnose dyscalculia. Depending on your child's school and local laws, the services offered to your child may differ. Talk with your child's school to learn more.Inform your school if your child has already been diagnosed with dyscalculia. Your child may be assigned a school tutor who will provide extra help with math. Your child may be given their own study plan, which will be built around their unique needs.  If you want to give your child some extra help, you may want to hire a private tutor. Tutors will meet with your child regularly, offering lessons that can help your them to learn mathematical skills and overcome their dyscalculia. Your tutor should specialize in working with children with learning disabilities. Your tutor should be aware of your child's dyscalculia. Ask someone at your child's school if they know of any tutors.  Left unchecked, your child's dyscalculia will not improve. However, regular practice can go a long way in avoiding the negative effects of dyscalculia. Make sure you are helping your child with their math lessons on a regular basis to help them learn and overcome their Dyscalculia.Try to practice for at least 10 minutes a day. Regular practice is best. Work at your child's pace whenever you help them practice their mathematics. Your child may view numbers and math differently than most people. Work with your child's own concepts of math to help them build their skills.  

offer support and encouragement.  practice math outside of school.  play math based games.  go through homework assignments together.  talk to your child's school.  consider hiring a private tutor.  practice math with your child. 

 You can discard the backing, but save the glass panel. You will be using it to trace the plastic canvas/mesh later.   You can use a plain frame, or an ornate one.  You can use spray paint or acrylic paint. Be sure to get the back and sides of the frame as well. Depending on how dark your frame is, or how light the paint is, you may need two coats of paint. Let the first layer dry before adding the second one., You can leave your frame plain as it is, or you can decorate it further to make it more special. Here are some ideas to get you started:   Glue some plastic gems or rhinestones along the frame Draw some designs on the frame using black, gold, or silver permanent marker Paint some bold designs on the frame, such as stripes, stars, or hearts Draw designs on the frame using glitter glue  , Plastic canvas looks like a plastic mesh or screen. It is stiff, and used to wave designs onto with yarn. Choose a color that matches your frame, or goes well with it.  Be sure cut along the lines, or it may fall through your frame.  Draw a line of glue all along the inside edges of the frame, where the glass panel used to rest. Quickly press the plastic canvas into the glue.   You can use hot glue or an industrial-strength (such as E6000) for this. Don't use regular school glue; it won't be strong enough.  Choose a color that matches your frame, then cut it down so that it matches your frame's width.  Tie the ends of the ribbon together to make a knot. Place some glue on the back of your frame, near the top, then press the knot into the glue.   If your frame has a metal bracket for hanging, you can thread the ribbon through this bracket. You can also hang the frame from the wall using just the bracket. If you don't want to hang your earring holder, get a frame stand instead, and set the frame down onto it instead.  You can now stick earrings into the mesh. This works well with hook and post earrings. When attaching post earrings, you will need to take the back off the earring first, push the earring through the mesh, then put the back on again.  

find a wooden frame and take out the backing and glass panel.  paint the frame and let it dry.  consider decorating the frame further, especially if it is a plain frame.  use a marker to trace the glass panel onto a sheet of plastic canvas.  cut the plastic canvas/mesh out.  glue the mesh to the back of your frame.flip your frame over so that the back is facing you.  cut a piece of ribbon.  make a loop from the ribbon, then glue it to the back of your frame.  wait for the glue to dry, then hang your earring holder. 

 Rifles are designed to fire a single projectile, often smaller than most pistol bullets, at a much higher rate of speed.  Carbines are usually lighter in weight, and are shorter barreled (and stocked) than full blown rifles. They often fire the same cartridges, however due to their length they are often chambered in smaller, less powerful calibers.        Rifle cartridges are far more powerful than handgun cartridges. This greater power means you can shoot effectively at a much longer distance.       Rifles still require a good deal of precision, but the dexterity needed for a pistol is not necessary, and stopping power is much improved.  Home defense situations may require you to place the stock below your shoulder, reducing your accuracy. Movement around corners and through doors may be hampered by your barrel preceding you through the door, warning an enemy that you're there.       Rifles are also more capable of "over penetration". This is where the bullet passes through an object, such as a wall, or your intended target and continue on with enough force to injure or kill. Over penetration can be mitigated through proper ammunition choice, but is always a serious consideration with rifles.       Rifle ammunition is much more expensive than handgun ammunition. This can mean that it is more expensive to practice with your rifle, and reduce the amount of training and practice you can afford.       The overall length of rifles also means that they are slower to aim than a handgun due to their weight. Compared to a pistol, swinging a rifle around to engage a threat can take longer, and in a self defense situation, lost time can be deadly.        

rifles are what most people envision when they think of a long gun.  rifles have a smaller cousin called a "carbine".  rifle advantages:  unlike pistol bullets, which typically create narrow permanent wound channels, the greatly increased speed of rifle bullets create a shock wave that can permanently destroy large amounts of tissue, greatly increasing your chances of stopping the threat with a single reasonably placed shot.  the disadvantages of a rifle:  as with any long gun, maneuverability is greatly reduced due to its overall length. 

 Because GTA V takes place in an area based off of California, finding a body of water isn’t exactly challenging. If you’re playing as Michael, you can practice swimming in your own backyard. If you’d like to try swimming in a more open area, there are a few open lakes that feed into the rivers.   The Tataviam mountain range has a large body of water in its center, and is located just outside of Los Santos, in the Northeast. To the north of Los Santos, located in the middle of Vinewood, is another large lake. Aside from the ocean, the largest body of water is the Alamo Sea, which feeds into several small rivers. The Alamo Sea is located to the west of Sandy Shores. The world of GTA V is surrounded on all sides by water, so if you continue in one direction for long enough, you’re sure to find the ocean eventually.; , You can enter the water simply by walking into it. Once the depth passes over your character’s head, they’ll immediately begin treading water.  To swim forward in the water, use the toggle stick (PS3, Xbox 360) or directional keys (PC). To accelerate your character’s speed, repeatedly tap the X Button (PS3), A button (Xbox 360), or the Shift key (PC).  If the water is over your character’s head, then you can try diving beneath the surface. Press the R1 button (PS3), RB button (Xbox 360), or Q key (PC) and your character will dive below the surface.   Once under the water, swim using the same controls that you would on the surface.  While in the water, the only weapon you can use is the knife. In case you need to defend yourself from sharks, you can equip the knife by pressing the L1 button (PS3), LB button (Xbox 360), or Tab key (PC). With the knife equipped, attack by pressing the Circle button (PS3), B button (Xbox 360), or the R key (PC).   You can attack while submerged or while treading water on the surface.  Because your character is only human, you can’t stay submerged forever. There is a light blue meter in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen, next to your character’s health. This indicates how long they can stay underwater. Once the light blue meter runs out, your character will begin to lose health very quickly. If you do not surface before their health runs out, you will die.  If the health meter is running low, surface quickly. To reach the surface again, simply press the toggle stick/directional arrow key upwards towards the surface of the water. To reach the surface more quickly, tap the X button (PS3), A button (Xbox 360), or Shift key (PC).  

find a body of water.  enter the water.  start swimming.  dive.  attack while swimming.  check your health.  surface. 

 You'll need around 3-5 of them to make a tunnel playground.; ,   To join tubes together, use scissors to cut 4 little slits around the very end of the tube, by the hole. Put the other tube in between these slits to join them. If it isn't fastened on tight enough, make the slits deeper. Make the system however long you want, but it has to fit inside the cage.  If you don't do so, the Gerbil may get the feeling he or she is stuck, or that he or she is losing air. It is always good to have little escape windows every few inches.   Connect the tunnels to make the playground more interesting.       You can add them in different places.  Adjust the system how you find appropriate in the bottom of the cage, and then add back the bedding. You will want to make sure at least 2 escape routes are showing, because if one Gerbil is trying to get in the same way as another Gerbil is trying to get out, it may end up in a fight. This may still happen, but 2 openings decreases the chance of that.  Now, remember, don't be alarmed if one day you come home or approach the Gerbil's cage and they are not in sight, check the tunnel system before you panic. Have fun, and I hope you enjoyed making your Gerbils a tunnel playground!  

when you're finished with toilet paper and paper towel cardboard tubes, get ready to reuse them!,  once you have 3-5 tubes, or enough tubes that you can build the tunnels you want, you can begin the very first steps to making an intricate tunnel system.  cut gerbil-sized holes every here and there, so they can come in and out as they please.  you will want to empty the cage of the bedding, and put it aside if it is still clean.  watch your gerbils as they examine the openings, pretty soon they will disappear into the ground! 

 This may take up a lot of space, but when you prepare oregano, the yield is much smaller than the initial hanging stalks.  It takes plenty of time to completely dry oregano, but this method will bring out the full flavor of the oregano.    Separate the flowers from the leaves. When you prepare oregano for storage, you want to harvest the leaves and flowers separately. Strip the leaves from the stalk by running your hand up and down the branch. It's best to have a clean counter space, because the dry oregano leaves will fall off in a pile. Collect the leaves and crumple them up with your fingers to make them powdery. Push the dry oregano onto a piece of paper, and use the paper as a funnel to pour the herb into airtight jars. 

hang the cut stalks upside down in a dry, warm and well-ventilated room.  let the stalks hang for a week.  process the oregano stalks.  discard stalks in the compost pile, if you have one, or throw them away in the garbage.  

 This is where you write the topic sentence, the supporting sentence, another supporting sentence with evidence and then another supporting sentence. Finish it off linking back to the question. , Start off with the topic sentence which Introduces concepts and other necessary information. Then you provide more specific information. Finnish it off by making an argument based on the info you have presented to the reader. Then conclude it.  You begin with a topic sentence which is the statement of the main idea of the paragraph. Then add in the explanation of supporting evidence. Then further evidence is needed. Next, write the application of ideas to a scenario or through the use of an example. Then you evaluate what you said and conclude it that brings the paragraph to a close.  

use the ‘t.s.s.s’ method.  use the ‘i.m.a’ method.  use the ‘t.e.f.a.e.c’ method. 

 A diet designed to boost endorphins and other mood enhancing chemicals can help the withdrawal process in addition to the emotional effects of ending an addiction.   High-quality proteins are important. You should aim to get in 20 – 30 grams of protein three times a day. Opt for lean proteins like chicken, fish, and turkey.Consume a variety of fruits and vegetables as well as heart healthy fats that are found in olive oils, canola oils, avocados, and nuts.The consumption of sugar and processed foods should be limited, if not cut out altogether.Make sure to drink a lot of water. The rule of thumb is to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water (1.9 liters) a day, but if you're detoxing from Suboxone you might need to drink a bit more., Daily exercise can boost endorphins, causing a more positive mood overall. This can lessen the psychological symptoms of withdrawal and help you stay focused on your commitment to a healthier, happier existence.   Exercise boosts mood, improves sleep, reduces pain and promotes good overall well-being. Strive for 30 to 60 minutes of vigorous exercise a day.How you choose to exercise is up to you, but know that people generally stick to exercise routines if they engage in behaviors they enjoy. If you enjoy long walks at night, incorporate a brisk daily walk into your routine. If there's a sport you enjoy, like tennis or softball, try to join a league in your area or find a friend to join you for a tennis match a few times a week.  Talk to friends and family members whom you trust and explain your situation to them. Ask for their support during your recovery and have a few good friends you can rely on when you're having rough days.   Community is incredibly important to an addict's recovery. In a study on rats, researchers placed some rats in groups and some rats alone in a cage. The rats were presented with a choice of two different water bottles. One was laced with cocaine and the other was normal water. In both groups, rats tried both kinds of water; however, it was only the rats who were left alone who became addicted to the cocaine-laced water. Scientist believe this demonstrates that socialization and support are powerful tools in combating addiction.In people, this has proven true as well. During the Vietnam War, many soldiers were functionally addicted to heroin overseas. When they returned to their homes, 95% of soldiers simply stopped heroin use without rehab or treatment. Comparisons have been drawn between this and the rat study. Both rats and humans had an easier time combating addiction when placed in a happier environment.During your recovery process, reach out to friends. Try to see people on a regular basis. Have a weekly game night or book club. Go to a community center in your area and enroll in an art or cooking class. Try to meet people and form a comforting, happy environment for yourself.  

change your diet.  exercise.  talk to your loved ones. 

 California provides a statewide uniform guideline for calculating child support. Within the statute is a formula that is used by judges and others when coming up with support payments. The guidelines, and the formula, can be found at http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=fam&group=04001-05000&file=4050-4076. The child support formula is: CS = K.   CS is the child support amount. K is the amount of both parents' incomes that can be allocated to child support. HN is the high earner's net monthly disposable income. H% is the approximate percentage of time the child will be in the physical custody of the high earner. TN is the total net monthly disposable income of both parents., To calculate K, you add one to your H% value if that value is less than or equal to 50%. If your H% value is greater than 50%, you will subtract two from that number. You will then multiply that number by one of the following fractions:   (.20 + TN/16,000) if your TN value is between $0 and $800. (.25) if your TN value is between $801 and $6,666. (.10 + 1,000/TN) if your TN value is between $6,667 and $10,000. (.12 + 800/TN) if your TN value is over $10,000. For example, if H% equals 20% and the TN value is $1,000, K = (1 + .20) x (.25), which is .30. Therefore, in this example, your K = .30., To figure out each party's net disposable income, you will need deduct various amounts from your total annual gross income. You will then divide this number by 12 in order to get the monthly amount.   Some of the deductions include income tax deductions, contribution deductions, mandatory union dues, health insurance costs, other spousal support payments, hardship deductions, and some job related expenses.For example, assume your annual gross income is $40,000. After deductions, assume your yearly disposable income is $6,500. Next, consider the other parent's yearly disposable income, which you can assume is $5,500. Assume they have an annual gross income of $35,000. Therefore, the total yearly disposable income of both parents equals $12,000 ($6,500 + $5,500). You will then divide this number by 12 to get the total monthly disposable income. In this example, that will equal $1,000 ($12,000/12). Therefore, your TN value will equal $1,000. In the same example, in order to figure out the HN value, you can simply divide the high earner's yearly disposable income by 12. Because the high earner is you, who makes $40,000 annually, you will divide your yearly disposable income by 12. When you do so, you will get $541.67 ($6,500/12). Therefore, your HN value will equal $541.67.  This will be an approximation based on the amount of time the parent that makes more money has physical control over the child. If you have worked out an agreement with the other parent, look at that agreement and make a determination.   For example, if you are the high earner, the H% percentage will represent the amount of time you have physical custody of your child. Assume you have an agreement with the other parent and it states that you get the child 20% of the time. Therefore, your H% value will equal 20%.  Once you have all of your numbers, you will plug them into the formula and make the calculation. The total that comes out is the amount of child support that should be paid according to the state guidelines.   For example, using the examples above, your completed formula should look like this: CS = .3. When you do the math, your CS should equal $102.50, which is the amount of monthly child support you would owe.  While the formula is the most common way of calculating child support, courts will deviate from it in certain situations.   For example, courts might not follow the formula when it produces a CS value that greatly exceeds the needs of the child. This usually happens when one parent has an extremely high income. In another example, if children have special medical or other needs, a court may require child support in an amount that exceeds the amount calculated using the formula. 

find the statutory formula.  calculate the k value.  compute each parent's monthly net disposable income.  determine the h% value.  plug your numbers into the formula.  consider when a court might deviate from the formula. 

 Be sure that the surface is not tilted, or the system will not work properly.  If the container you have is designed for a multi flow system, it should automatically turn the power on and off as the water levels in the container change. Thus, this is a safer and more efficient flood/drain system than those used in ebb and flows (see next section)  , Ensure that everything is working properly.         

place your six pots on a stable surface.  connect them with the pvc fittings and tubes.  put the plants in the small plant trays. 

 Once you have determined your fat-burn zone, try to stay in it for at least 30 to 50 minutes. This will help you burn fat while you walk around looking for Pokémon. In order to focus on playing Pokémon GO, you may want to use a fitness tracker so that you are not distracted by checking your pulse.   The longer that you walk around, the more calories that you will burn. If you want to see the health benefits of playing Pokémon GO, try to play for at least 45 minutes.For example, if you weigh 156 lbs (71 kg), you will burn about 176 calories if you walk for about 40 minutes.Depending on your age, weight and gender, the number of calories you will burn while walking will vary.  Another easy way to increase your heart rate and get into the fat-burn zone is to jog around while you play Pokémon GO. Instead of walking while you play the game, try lightly running as your search for Pokémon, visit gyms and go to PokéStops.Try jogging for at least thirty minutes. Be sure to watch where you are going if you decide to jog and play Pokémon GO. Try not to get too distracted and run into someone or something.  You can also use Pokémon GO to practice interval training. During this exercise, you do multiple short sprints. This will get your heart rate up and push it into the fat-burn zone. Consider running hard between gyms and PokéStops while you play, and then catch your breath once you get to where you are going.Depending on where you live, there may be less than a quarter of a mile (1/2 km) between PokéStops, which is ideal for interval running. You can also decide to sprint for a certain amount of time, and then walk for a set amount of time. For example, you might sprint for two minutes and then walk for thirty seconds.  Strength training can also help you maximize the number of calories that you burn while playing Pokémon GO. You can incorporate strengthen training into the game by doing some push-ups and sit-ups every time you stop at a PokéStop or a gym. Consider doing three sets of five push-ups at first and gradually increase the number every few weeks.If you are running intervals, do a set of pushups and sit-ups between each sprint.  If you want to cover a lot of ground quickly and burn some calories, you might want to ride your bike. Consider cycling between PokéStops and gyms. This will allow you to cover a larger area and get in some good exercise. You can ride to a certain area, walk around looking for Pokémon and then bike somewhere else.Do not look at your phone while you ride your bike. If you are distracted, you can wreck and hurt yourself and others. While you ride your bike, put your phone away. Try to stay safe while playing Pokémon GO.  

walk in the fat-burn zone for 30 to 50 minutes.  jog while you look for pokémon.  run between gyms or pokéstops.  do some push-ups and sit-ups each time that you stop.  ride your bike. 

 If you are choosing a new everyday style, it’s best to keep details about your life in mind. Consider the needs of your workplace, how much time you have to style your hair, and how much effort you are willing to put in to your daily look.   Regardless of the hairstyle you choose, it should work with your personality. You'll need to be comfortable with your new style, so don't pick a style that doesn't match your own personal tastes. If your stylist recommends a hairstyle that you don't feel comfortable with, politely tell them how you feel and find something else.; , It helps if you can go to a stylist that you're already familiar with, but if you need to find a new stylist, ask friends or coworkers for recommendations. Take photos of hairstyles you like and ask the stylist if the look would work with your facial shape.   Remember what kind of a cut you get, so that you can remind the stylist at future appointments or ask for something slightly different. If you like the cut, be sure to tip well. You should also ask your stylist for maintenance and styling tips. They'll be able to point you in the right direction for what products to use and how often to get trims.  When you're deciding where to place your part, think about your face shape and your natural part. If you have a round face, don't part your hair in the middle - it will emphasize the roundness. If you have a sharp jaw and high cheekbones, a part that's far to one side will highlight these qualities. In general, a part that's a few inches off-center works well for most people. Experiment to see what you like best.   You can use your fingers or a comb to part your hair. Keep in mind that finger-combing will result in a wavier, more natural look, while using a fine-toothed comb will make your hairstyle more sleek and structured.  Unless you're spiking your hair out in every possible direction, you'll notice that most hairstyles have one primary direction in which the hair is combed. You can comb it forward, back, up, to the side, or straight down. Experiment with a few different ways and see what works best for you.   Note that most men only style and comb the top portion of their hair, unless their hair is on the long side of medium or longer. The back and sides of most men's haircuts are short enough that they don't require much day-to-day styling.  Unfortunately, most of us need more than water and a comb to style our hair. Start off with less expensive brands while you're experimenting with different types of products. When you find something you like (such as hair clay), then you can try to find the right brand for you. Here are a few possible products you can purchase, as well as the sort of look they'll help you achieve:    Serums or creams. These can help you tame fly-aways or de-frizz curls without making your hair stiff and immovable.  Mousse. Use hair mousse to add volume and shine to your hair, with minimal hold. For best results, apply to wet hair and allow your hair to dry.  Gel. Unlike pomade, gel contains alcohol that dries out hair and makes for a stiffer hold. For the strongest hold, apply gel to wet hair.  Pomade, hair wax, or hair clay. Use these products to mold your hair into difficult-to-achieve shapes, such as pompadours or curls (for naturally straight hair). Be aware that it can take several washes to remove these products, so apply them lightly. A pea-sized amount should be plenty if you have short, medium or thin hair. Use pomade or hair wax for a shiny, wet look; use hair clay for a matte, natural tone.  Hair glue. Ever wonder how some people get their mohawks to stand straight up? They're probably using some variation of hair glue, which provides the strongest possible hold. Be wary of product build-up, however, and wash your hair thoroughly between applications.  Depending on the product and hairstyle, you may want to apply the styling product before you comb your hair. If you're worried about your hair drooping or losing its structure throughout the day, mist it with hairspray as soon as you're finished styling. You can choose a product with light or strong hold (just remember that "strong hold" means "more alcohol," which can make your hair look more brittle).   Be sure to keep the hairspray at least six inches away from your hair when spraying it. Avoid spraying too much or your hair might clump together and look hard. Hair wax is also a simple way to set your hairstyle. Just rub a little bit of wax between your fingers until it softens and then pinch it between strands of hair to work it in.  Why are you styling your hair? Are you going to Prom? Meeting your girlfriend's parents? Just want cool hair? Make the look match the situation.   Keep in mind that formal events call for more traditional hairstyles. Your cousin may not want you to wear a high Mohawk to her wedding. It may be best to choose a style that is close to your everyday style for an important event; this will help you feel more comfortable during the event.  If you started using cheap products for your daily style, you may want to consider springing for better quality products for your special occasion. Cheap products are more likely to cause build-up or undesired effects such as making your hair look either too dry or too oily.   Be sure to use the products a couple of times before the special occasion so that you know how your hair reacts to the product.  If you are going to a formal event, such as prom or a wedding (as a guest or a member of the wedding party), you may want to ask someone for styling help for the event. A professional stylist, a parent, or even your date may be able to offer suggestions for what would look nice on you.  The most important aspect of your special-event hairstyle is that it should look like you spent time trying to make your hair look perfect.Your part should be made with a comb so that it looks sharp. You should use product to keep the hair where you intend for it to be. A quality hair product that adds a bit of shine or a wet look often works for events.  If the even that you are attending is going to last more than an hour or two, you may need to refresh your hair to keep it looking neat. This can be as simple as keeping a small comb in your inside jacket pocket, wetting it in the men’s room, and running it through your hair. This will likely re-activate your styling product (particularly hair gel) and can help you make it to the end of the event still looking snazzy.  It's generally understood that not every hairstyle will look good on everyone. This largely has to do with facial shape and features. A useful way to find your facial shape is to stand in front of a mirror and mark the outline of your face (not including your hair or ears) using a bar of soap or makeup pencil. You should be able to see a definitive shape.  Once you have determined your face shape, try to find a hairstyle that suits the shape. This may require patience, as you may find that you need to grow your hair longer in order to style it appropriately. Here are suggestions for styles based on your face shape:    Oval face: Choose almost any hairstyle, but bangs or fringe will make your face appear rounder.Square face: Choose a softer style around your hairline. Short, tight hairstyles will play up your sharp features. Avoid parting your hair in the center.Oblong face: Choose a balanced style. Short sides and a long top will make your face look even longer. Keeping some hair styled onto your face can help balance your facial length.  Round face: Avoid sharp bangs or lots of hair swept onto the face.Diamond-shaped face: You may want to choose longer hairstyles. Avoid sharp haircuts near the ears and straight hair.Heart-shaped face: Choose longer hair. Facial hair, such as a beard, mustache, or goatee, will also help balance the lower part of your face.Triangular face: Choose a style that adds width and volume at the top.Keeping your hair wavy or curly is a good way to add the volume.  Is your hair wavy, straight, textured, or curly? Is it fine, medium, or thick? Certain hairstyles will work better with your hair's natural tendencies and can make styling easier.  While some of these styles work with any hair texture, most work best with a specific hair type. Evaluate what your hair naturally tends to do and find a hairstyle that complements those tendencies.   If you have straight hair of any consistency, consider choosing the Prohibition High-and-Tight, let it grow out (as long as it isn't fine), flow and comb it, or crop it.  The Prohibition High-and-Tight features very short sides while fading hair shorter into your nape and sideburns. The top should be a little longer, about an inch and a half. To style, use a gel to keep the top combed into place.Don't choose this look if you have wavy or curly hair. To let your hair grow out for a messy look, simply let your hair grow past your shoulders. Styling is simple, just towel dry your hair and apply a little texture cream.The flow and comb starts with a square cut, but is longer on the sides and the top. Apply a mousse to your wet hair, then comb the hair back.Avoid this if you have curly hair. Cropped hair is essentially cut short evenly across the sides and the top. You don't really need styling products with this low-maintenance cut.If you have curly or wavy hair, consider choosing a pompadour, let it grow out, or crop it.  The pompadour is simply a classic haircut. The blended cut should be done to a ratio of 2 to 1, top to sides. This basically means that you should leave the sides shorter than the top, but not drastically shorter. Style with a pomade and comb the top into place.Avoid this look if you have very fine, straight, or thin hair. To let your hair grow out for a messy look, simply let your hair grow past your shoulders. Styling is simple, just towel dry your hair and apply a little texture cream.For more of a bed-head look, ask your stylist to add texture and style with a hair gel. Cropped hair is essentially cut short evenly across the sides and the top. You don't really need styling products with this low-maintenance cut.If you have a receding hairline, just keep your hair short. If you're feeling adventurous, you could shave everything off and possibly grow a beard or goatee.  There is no hard and fast rule about hairstyle. While these suggestions may help, you should ultimately find a style that makes you feel comfortable and like yourself. Don’t be afraid to try out different styles every month or so until you find one that you really like.  The average length of classic sideburns is the middle point of your ear, but this can be adjusted according to your facial features and head shape. Whatever length you choose, the sideburns should match your hairstyle. So, if you have short hair, the sideburns should be kept short and well trimmed. Sideburns can be longer and thicker with a longer, looser hairstyle.Longer sideburns can actually make your face look narrower, while sideburns that are shorter than mid-ear length can have the opposite effect. Typically, shorter sideburns work well with longer faces, while longer sideburns can elongate shorter faces. 

consider your situation.  get a new haircut.  part your hair.  comb your hair.  select hair products.  apply the appropriate styling products and set with hairspray (optional).  consider your styling needs and situation.  use quality products.  ask for input.  make everything crisp and neat.  make a “refresher” plan.  determine your facial shape.  choose a style that complements your facial shape.  figure out your hair type.  pick a hairstyle that matches your hair type.  try a variety of styles.  choose a sideburn length. 

 If you are in the middle of the road looking for the animal, you are in an area that is not safe. This is especially true if it's dark. Other vehicles may not see you and you can run the risk of getting hurt yourself. You should always be alert for other vehicles and assume they can't see you.   Make sure you assess the condition of the road and listen out for oncoming cars. If it is a busy road, be extra careful. If you hit an animal on a busy highway, expressway, or interstate, you should not stop and try to help. The risk to your personal well being is too great.; , If it's dark, you need to get a flashlight or other source of light. This will help you see where the animal is as well as help you be seen by others. You should also put on your vehicle's hazard warning lights to alert other drivers to your presence. Even if it happens during the day, put on your hazard warning lights to alert other drivers that you are stopped.It may be helpful to leave the headlights on if they illuminate the injured animal. If they don't, turn them off so as not to drain the battery in your car.  In most cases, where the animal is will be obvious. The animal is usually still in the road or by the roadside. However, some creatures, especially wild animals, will use the last of their strength to run and hide.   If you cannot see the creature, look for a trail of blood or recently flattened plants to see if you can spot him. If the animal is a wolf, large deer, or other dangerous animal, you should not approach without assistance., It is possible that you hit a wild animal. Wild animals are likely to react with aggression at the best of times, but when injured they will be even more hostile. Before touching a wild animal, you need to prepare as fully as you can. If you have cell phone signal, call the nearest vet, the ASPCA, or a wildlife rehabilitator. You can find these numbers on the internet or by calling information.   They may be able to send someone to help. If they agree to do this, stay with the animal so that you can guide the rescuer to his exact location. You should wait for their arrival if possible. The ASPCA or a wildlife rehabilitator will have special equipment for handling wild animals, such as leather gauntlets, special restraining devices, and cages. If you hit a wild animal that is considered dangerous or is too big, such as a wolf, fox, bear, or large deer, do not approach the animal. You should always wait for help with these animals because you do not want to get yourself hurt. Professionals know how to deal with these types of animals. Never deal with a hurt animal if emergency services are on the way. Just stay with the animal until they arrive., If the animal you find is overly aggressive, you should no approach it, even if you cannot get help. If the animal looks like he is shaking uncontrollably, a dropped jaw, or excessive or frothy, white saliva, you should not approach the animal either. These are signs that the animal may have rabies.If you have no way to call for help when you hit this type of animal, you should take note of your location and then drive to a place where you can call for help.  If the animal is wild but there is no animal inspector or veterinarian available, you need to plan how you are going to safely pick the animal up and transport it. If the animal is small, you need to look for a box or suitable container in your car to transport him.   If he is large, you may need to fit him in the trunk. You may also need a large board or blanket so you can transport him. You should look for gloves or other protective gear as well. Having all of these things together will help you when you get ready to transport the animal. Do not pick him up before you make sure you are ready to handle him., Domestic animals are used to people and you may be able to approach and calm the animal much easier than a wild animal. However, you should be very careful in either case. Animals in pain will snap and react with aggression, so be prepared for this and act accordingly.   You should follow the same size concerns as with a wild animal. Find a box or crate for a small animal. Look for a place to transport a large animal as well as a blanket or board. You should also find protective gear for domestic animals as well. They can be vicious, especially when injured.If the domestic animal allows you to approach it, fashion an improvised muzzle if possible. This will eliminate the risk of the animal biting.  Before you touch the animal and try to move him, you should observe him from a distance. Look to see if the animal breathing normally. This means he is taking one breath every three to four seconds. Also notice if he is trying to get up and if so, watch to see if you can tell if his legs are damaged.   If he doesn't try to get up, look for obvious injuries such as broken bones sticking through the skin, any excessive or noticeable bleeding, or the presence of gaping wounds., If you have decided that the animal needs immediate help and there is no emergency services on the way, you can approach the animal. As you approach the animal, you should move slowly and speak reassuringly to the animal. The animal will be scared and in pain, so calming tones will work best. Depending on the kind of animal or his size, you need to approach him in different ways.   For a small, cat-sized animal, use a blanket or a coat to throw over the animal. This should prevent the cat or other small animal from turning and biting or lashing out with claws while you help him. You have a couple of different options for a dog. You should assume the dog will bite. You can throw the blanket over the dog's head, so his teeth are covered. What might work best, however, is to wrap a tie or a bandage around the dog's muzzle as a makeshift muzzle. Once the mouth is out of action, it is safer to examine the animal's injuries.No matter what method you use, make sure the animal can breath and you don't jostle him around too much. If you have to make a muzzle, make sure he has enough room left to pant and breath., The animal that you hit may go into shock. Animals can die from shock, even if they don't have physical injuries. Watch to see if he is panting, which is a sign of pain and shock. Other signs of shock include collapse, weakness, rapid breathing, pale gums, cold paws, slow capillary refill time, and lack of response to stimulus.   If you see the animal in shock, you may need to help him on site before you take him to get help. Only do this is you feel it is necessary to save the animal's life., By the roadside, the amount of help you can give against shock is limited. In practical terms, the best you can do is keep the animal warm and get to professional help as soon as possible. Animals in shock have cold extremities because their circulation is struggling. If it is safe to touch the animal, you need to feel the temperature of the animal's paws. If they feel cool to the touch, he is suffering from chills and you need to wrap him up.   For a domesticated animal with no obvious external injuries that need attention, cover the animal with a car rug, your coat, or a blanket. If the animal is small, wrap the coat right around the animal to insulate him from the ground. Never give pain relief medication to the dog. His body, especially in shock, will not absorb the medication and the drug will sit in his gut. This can cause serious gastric ulceration which could be life threatening further down the line. If the animal is bleeding or has an injury which need stabilizing, cover as much of the animal as you can. You should leave the bleeding area exposed for you to work on., If the wild animal seems dazed but has obvious external injuries, try to keep him warm while you wait for emergency services. Don't try to fix his wounds. If he is not recovering and remains dazed, his best chance of survival is being treated by a wildlife rehabilitation officer. If there is no help on the way, you need to transport the animal to the nearest facility.   If the animal is merely winded, he may try to get up after a few minutes and wander off. Do not try to stop him. His best bet for survival is to stay on his territory in the wild. He has a den out there and knows where the resources are. Removing him unnecessarily could make it difficult for him to slot back in when released., Traumatic injuries cause two types of blood loss, heavy bleeding from severed arteries or veins and slow seepage from scrapes and wounds. The wound pumping blood should be given priority over the slowly seeping injury. If a wound is dripping blood, you need to try to stem the blood flow. First, apply pressure using a pad of cotton material applied directly over the area. Press down with sufficient pressure to prevent blood seeping through the cotton.   If after 5 minutes you remove the pad and the blood starts pumping out again, repeat the pressure for another 5 minutes. Sometimes reapplying pressure is all it takes., If reapplying pressure doesn't work, you need to make a pressure bandage. A pressure bandage is another way of applying pressure and can be enough to stop the bleeding while you transport the animal. For a pressure bandage, make a cotton pad and hold it over the wound. Next, take a bandage or a cotton garment cut into strips and wind it around the area and the pad to hold it firmly in place.   Apply firm tension onto the bandage as you wind it round so that finished dressing feels firm when you squeeze it. You should not be able to worm a finger between the bandage and the skin. These bandages can run the risk of impairing circulation to a limb if left in place for hours, but are acceptable if the animal may suffer potentially fatal blood loss otherwise. You should go directly to professional help after applying this type of bandage., If there is blood spurting out, the animal may have an arterial bleed. This is very serious and you may need to make a tourniquet. To apply a tourniquet, take a shoelace or tie and tie it around the limb so it lies between the bleed and the heart. Tighten the tourniquet until the bleeding stops. Be aware this has also cut off the blood supply to the rest of the limb so make haste to professional assistance.   Only do this if it is essential and you suspect the animal may otherwise die from blood loss. Tourniquet use is controversial because there is a risk of the tourniquet cutting off the circulation, which potentially may cause the loss of the limb. You can reduce this risk by loosening the tourniquet every 10 minutes, which allows blood back into the rest of the limb. If you have someone with you, have her drive while you keep pressure applied to the tourniquet., A slowly seeping wound is an injury that is moist with blood but not actually dripping. In this case, it may not be necessary to do anything because this rate of blood loss is usually not dangerous. If necessary, collect a clean cotton cloth, such as a sterile swab from a first aid kit or a clean item of clothing. Form it into a pad and press it firmly over the area.   Maintain pressure for 3-5 minutes and then remove the pad. The bleeding should have stopped. If it hasn't, either leave the wound and transport the animal to help or apply a pressure bandage over the area. , When you working with the animal's wounds, do not try to clean them while you are still on the side of the road. Grit or contamination needs thorough irrigation with copious amount of sterile saline to be effective. This can only be done at a veterinary clinic or an equipped wildlife rescue area.   You should not waste time after you access the bleeding and just get him to a clinic as soon as you can., If you notice or suspect that the animal is suffering from a broken bone, do not try to straighten broken limbs or push exposed bones back under the skin. You will cause unimaginable pain to the animal, which will worsen his shock and could kill him. If the limb is very floppy, gently support it by placing your hand beneath the limb to take its weight as you lift the animal.   If bones are exposed and you have a first aid kit, lay a sterile swab over the exposed bone to try to decrease contamination. Lift the animal as you support the limb's weight and put the animal into your vehicle. You should not dress or bandage a limb by the roadside unless it is severely bleeding. The bandage can press on the broken bones and cause more pain. Just get to help as soon as you can., If the small animal is already in a blanket, scoop him up while supporting the back and front end with your arms. If he isn't in a blanket or you need to move him to a cleaner or warmer material, you should lift the animal as gently as possible onto the blanket and then pick him up, supporting his back and head.   You want to jostle him as little as possible because you don't want to cause any more pain. Never pick him up by the scruff and let the spine dangle perpendicular to the ground, especially if you think he has any bone injuries., A large animal is much harder to move than a small one, especially if you are by yourself. A board or large, study object works best for carrying large animals. If you don't have one, a blanket or a coat will work. Lay the board or blanket behind the animal and lift him onto the board. Cover him with a blanket or towel and have someone help you carry him to your car.   Do not roll the animal unless you absolutely have to. This can be extremely painful and cause more injury to the already wounded animal. If the animal struggles and kicks, you may need to secure the blanket down so they cannot injure themselves further by struggling. If you are alone, a blanket may be all that you can carry. Do the best you can in the situation that you are in and try to get to help as quickly as possible., It will be necessary to transport the injured animal to veterinary care, and to do this he has to be moved. Your aim is to do this as gently as possible, so you do not worsen any injuries or cause unnecessary pain. If the animal has a broken bone, make sure the animal lies with the damaged leg on top so his body weight is not resting on the injured limb.   If you suspect a spinal injury, handle the animal gently and try to support the back. You should also not move it too much or bend the back area. This can cause more injury and extreme pain., Once you have the animal safely in your car, you need to take it to the nearest veterinary hospital or wildlife rescue. If you do not have a way to find out this information, you need to drive somewhere that you can find out this information and then find the nearest place for emergency animal care possible.   If you are going to a vet's office, you should call ahead of time so they can expect your arrival.You should also call the wildlife rescue ahead of time and let them know the type of animal you are bringing in.  

keep yourself safe.  use lights.  locate the animal.  call for help if the animal is wild.  never approach overly aggressive animals.  help the wild animal if no help is available.  rescue a domestic animal.  assess the injuries.  approach the animal.  look for signs of shock.  cover him up.  care for a wild animal.  stop the flow of heavy bleeding.  apply a pressure bandage.  make a tourniquet.  dealing with slow seepage.  do not clean wounds.  support broken bones.  transport a small animal.  carry a large animal.  be gentle.  take the animal to help. 

 There are 10 countries that could be organized according to some scheme or another.  Chunking works well when you're memorizing things that are composed of smaller things in a sensible order. Our example could subdivide by continent; the elements of the periodic table could be broken down by type; or if you have to memorize the components of an engine, you could divide it up into sub-assemblies (intake, engine, exhaust, electrical).  If you've ever memorized a phone number, you might have noticed the way we write them - they're set up to be chunk-memorized. For instance, the White House phone number, (202) 456-1111 is easier to remember as three numbers - 202, 456 and 1111 - than it is to remember as a single complex number, 2,024,561,111. Chunking isn't a great strategy for big, complex things and concepts that don't break down into parts easily. For example, it's not easy to figure out what "memorizable" chunks would be for memorizing the concept of civil rights, the definition of nationhood or a list of similar phone numbers.  Since you'll have to create smaller pieces from big ones, this strategy works best with items that you can actually break down according to some sensible scheme.  For our UN Security Council example, you might try reciting one of the continents and their countries from the list above:  , Mastering each individual portion or chunk is just the beginning - to fully memorize something using this method, you'll need to get the entire list down. Try scrolling down so the previous list is covered. How much of this list can you remember? 

imagine you have to memorize the countries on the un security council.  know what chunking is good for.  divide what you have to memorize into smaller, easier-to-memorize pieces.  practice producing your your small items (the chunks) from memory.  practice combining the chunk. 

 There's a fine line though. Don't be the trashy girl who treats people like crap. That's not attractive either.  Confidence is more attractive than almost anything else, but it has to be genuine confidence. The fake variety is worse than none at all.  But not with his closest friends.  How can you expect someone to love you if you don't love yourself? Start taking care of your own wants and needs, and you'll be surprised at how attractive you suddenly become.  

men like a woman with a little bit of attitude.  be confident.  be flirtatious.  love yourself. 

 If you don't then there can be many misunderstandings and fights. Be with them whenever you can and get to know them better. A lot of families now don't get to know each other too well because they're too busy.

They also have an opinion or suggestion. Sometimes it can be bad or good. Never be angry with someone's opinion, they have their opinions, and no one's perfect.  No one wants to be ignored just for some meeting or work. Give time to each and every one of them so you can understand every individual properly and this can prevent any misunderstandings in the future.  Whether its your maid or stepchild, they also deserve love and affection from you as you deserve from your wife/husband or from your own child. Treat everyone like you would want to be treated, and getting along with your family should be easy  , This can create hatred for you in their hearts. By simply making them understand can do a lot. Why waste energy when you can do it calmly?    Try not to fight with your siblings. Fighting can tear your relationship apart and you'll regret it when you get older. Treasure the time you have with your siblings, you can't get it back. , When you or someone else in your family wants the total opposite of each other, find a way to work it out to give you all what you want.  When you see your sibling or parent needs help, help them. Doing little things such as holding the door for them, or helping someone with homework. ,, First ask them about it and if they don't want to share then its OK. It's just hormones. If you think that something is really bad, ask their close friends and help him/her.  This can hurt them or make them feel that you are a liar and every time will break promises. , Scolding can be good for them but never overdo it.  If someone in your family has done something wrong or have betrayed your trust, make them realize their mistake in an easy way. Do not yell or use abusive language.   

understand your family well.  respect your family.  give time.  treat everyone as equal.  never scream or shout at anyone.  never discriminate.  ,  learn to compromise.  help each other.  organizing surprise birthday parties and celebrating any individual's achievements can really help.  ,  avoid using offensive and abusive words against each other or your family will get cross and start shouting at you.  ,  sometimes teenagers can feel sad or lonely.  never ever break any promise.  learn to forgive.  ,  don't scold too much.  make them realize in an easy way. 

 Before you can get started, it’s important to identify what, specifically, interests you about broadcast journalism. Knowing this will help you figure out what kind of training or future steps you should take.Take some time for personal introspection; ask yourself what type of news you’re most interested in: politics or entertainment news, for example.

If your community has a local access TV or radio station, volunteer to be an on-air correspondent for local news.  Even though these are often entry-level and unpaid positions, internships are a great way to get your foot in the door.

 Do not use products that contain sulfates (natural oil-stripping detergents), silicone, alcohols or glycerol (hair drying and damaging chemicals) - this eliminates about 96% of available African hair care products quite apart from the poisons manufactured within Africa.; , They all severely stress your hair.  Heat removes moisture and can fry your hair irreparably. It is preferably better to leave hair to dry naturally, rather than blowing heat.  Shampoo washes away oil which protects your hair. When shampooing, apply it only to the scalp, and lather very gently. After washing hair, just gently squeeze it with a towel. No pulling or roughness.  African hair needs moisture and deep conditioning, especially when exposed to heat appliances like blow dryers and flat irons. A conditioner is a cream that is applied to the hair to smooth the cuticle, soften the hair, add sheen, and restore moisture. Oils like jojoba oil can help as well. Moisturize everything but the scalp.  Don't plop it all on top of your head. Rinse and repeat.  Don't pull out any hair. As you comb, apply conditioner through your hair and massage the scalp (Affirm, Matrix or Motions are suggested). Put a plastic shower cap over your head so ALL of your hair is in it. Leave it on for about 30 minutes and rinse your hair out. Comb it out as you rinse ( using slightly cooler than lukewarm water adds natural shine to the hair).  Conditioner washing is washing your hair with a lightweight moisturizing conditioner, eliminating the shampoo step which can be very drying, especially to chemically damaged hair. Many with damaged relaxed hair wash daily.  Apply more to the ends if they are dry. Avoid applying conditioner to the scalp unless it is dry. Rinse out conditioner very well.  Then comb out your hair (this involves a lot of combing and brushing) and work in a heat protection product. Blow dry it on WARM setting - the hot setting will dry out and damage your hair. As you dry, work in a smoothing serum. Paul Mitchell works - and brush it downwards (root to tip) with a circular brush. When you are done, separate it into four large sections (right front, left front, right back, left back and bangs if you have then).  Repeat the above process once every week (or two). Get a trim every 3-4 months.  

don't use any chemical treatment: any chemical treatment that changes your hair will also at best weaken it and possibly kill it.  make simple hair styling: styling that tugs at your hair and on glued-in extensions, tight braids, tight cornrows, and hard gel hairstyles.  minimize or better still, eliminate heat exposure.  shampoo only to clean your hair from dirt and old skin cells.  keep hair moisturized.  wet your hair thoroughly and apply a palm's sized amount of shampoo (paul mitchell, matrix or motions suggested) on the each side of the head and lather well.  gently comb out your hair with a wide tooth comb or what most people know as afro comb.  'co-wash'.  for best results, simply rinse the hair well with warm water, and apply conditioner to the hair, starting about 2 inches (5.1 cm) away from the scalp, and smooth it through to the ends.  for after-wash care, begin with towel drying (pat your hair dry - don't rub, it causes hair to frizz).  maintenance: every night, before bed, oil your scalp, brush you hair and wrap it.

 There are many jobs in the fashion industry, but 1 thing that most fashion employees have in common is a desire to keep up with the trends and changes in the industry. Foster this love by reading fashion magazines and blogs and going to fashion shows in your area.; , You do not have to be a designer to work for a fashion company, so assess both your aptitudes and past experience. On a sheet of paper, list your skills and experience so you can see what fits best when you assess jobs.  In order to choose your education and training path, you should decide which of the following departments in a fashion company would be best for you:   Fashion publicity. A fashion publicist helps a brand or company to communicate its message or brand to its target audience. If you're a communications professional or just have a way with words and people, then consider going into public relations. Your expertise in turning a phrase, creating a press release, talking to reporters or organization can help you to work as a fashion show producer or event coordinator for a fashion company. Seek a bachelor's degree in public relations with a minor in a fashion design or merchandising. Fashion designer. If you enjoy sketching, sewing and producing your own creative designs, then you will be part of a competitive field. Much of the energy that goes into the fashion industry is provided by this creative and driven set of people. It is a good idea to attend a fashion design school, where you will learn about the industry and skills needed to make it as a designer. Fashion management. If you would love to be behind the business end of fashion, then a career in fashion management is a good choice. Seek a degree in business administration or marketing with a minor in a fashion subject. Fashion companies small and large need account executives, store managers, project managers, production coordinators and human resource departments. Strive to be professional, highly motivated and ambitious. Fashion retail store manager. If you have worked in apparel stores and you like the environment, then consider becoming a store manager, area manager and general manager.

Store managers can improve their chances by getting an associate's degree or bachelor's degree in business administration. Fashion merchandising. This department includes a group of highly trained fashion professionals who know fashion trends, textiles and industry-specific production information.

After completing your schooling, keep a professional portfolio that emphasizes your paid or spec work with fashion companies.  Few people break into the fashion industry without taking an internship to gain experience. Although these internships can be unpaid or low-paying, it is important to pay your dues and learn the industry from the bottom up.   Apply for internships while you are still in school. The best way to get a head start on your career with a fashion company is to start working in the field as soon as you are able. Check to see if your school has any connections to internships at larger companies. Keep applying if you fail to get an internship right away. Pay attention to the way you dress. Perhaps no other industry has the same emphasis on matching company culture through dress. Dress professionally but stylish for the interview, and then adjust your clothing to what will help you become a part of the company's image. Ask questions. The best way to avoid making large mistakes is to ask before doing something for the first time. Many interns worry that they will offend fashion professionals by asking too much. Ask the question and then prove you are a fast learner. Take advantage of doing the grunt work. Doing small jobs well is the best way to prove your worth. Although you might be capable of more, the aim of an internship is to prove you are a hard worker with an aptitude for the business.  Most fashion companies have a very traditional structure starting with internships and moving up to entry-level positions. The following are some good jobs to apply for:   Sales representative.

It is likely that you will work late nights to get the store ready for business hours. As you prove yourself, you will be given small projects to design and complete. Design assistant. Before you can become a full-time designer, you may need to spend a few years as a designer assistant. You will help sketch, make and produce designs. The job may also include travel to trade shows and helping with event production. Marketing assistant/junior marketer. In this position, you will be responsible for staying on top of fashion and online trends. Many junior marketing professionals are asked to work with social media and small marketing projects where you can show your creativity and consistency. Assistant buyer.

You will be able to submit reports and opinions on trends. As you prove yourself, you may be given a budget and several buying projects. PR assistant. You will need to work your way up before having your own account in a fashion PR firm. Assistants help to create a PR package and keep clients happy on a day to day basis. You will work up to handling your own PR campaigns.  Many entry-level fashion jobs are very hard work for less pay than managers or executives.

 There are different types of materials that cats like to scratch on, including corrugated cardboard, carpeted surfaces, and sisal (a type of rug). Scratching posts can be oriented vertically or horizontally, but cats tend to prefer vertical posts.Scratching posts can also come in different shapes and sizes.Sisal is a very popular scratching material with cats.Sisal can be found at your local rug store; you could also contact your veterinarian or local pet store to see where it can be purchased. Scratching posts are a good way for cats to stretch their muscles. Although cats tend to prefer vertical posts, horizontal posts will also allow your cat to get a good stretch when she’s scratching.; , With the wide variety of available scratching posts, purchase several and let your cat choose which ones she prefers.Keep in mind that you and your cat may have very different ideas of the ideal scratching post. Give her the space to make her own decision on what she prefers.If you purchase a vertical scratching post, make sure that it is tall enough (about 2 feet) for your cat to stretch out her entire body when she scratches.Make sure that the scratching post is stable and sturdy. If the vertical post is unsteady and topples over when your cat scratches it, then she will not use that post. If your cat prefers a horizontal scratching post, try to secure it under another piece of furniture so that it stays in place when your cat uses it., Once your cat has been scratching on the post for a while, it will look tattered and extremely worn. Although you’ll want to throw it away at this point, your cat will think that it’s perfectly worn in and just the way she wants it., Cats scratch for a variety of reasons, including marking their territory, stretching their muscles, sharpening their claws, and simply having fun.Scratching is something that cats need to do, so do not try to stop your cat from scratching your leather sofa by stopping her scratching behavior completely.  Given that you can’t stop your cat from scratching, you will need to teach her that she shouldn’t use your sofa as a scratching post. There are a number of techniques that can discourage her from scratching your sofa.   Place an orange peel near the sofa. Cats do not like the smell of citrus.Soak some cotton balls in smells that are unpleasant to cats (eg, cologne, perfume, or a menthol-scented muscle rub) and place them near the sofa.Attach materials to your sofa that make it difficult for your cat to scratch, such as aluminum foil, double-sided tape, and sandpaper.Spray her with water (just a few spritzes) when you see her scratching your sofa. This may temporarily discourage her from scratching your sofa, but it’s likely that your cat will just learn to scratch when you are not around. This technique will not be effective in the long term.Remove her scent from the sofa. Cats will scratch where they have left their scent, so removing her scent from the sofa will discourage her from scratching on it. Visit your local pet store to purchase an odor-removal spray., It could take anywhere from several weeks to several months for your cat to stop trying to scratch your sofa. As your cat begins to avoid your sofa more and more, remove one undesirable item at a time. By the time you finish removing them, your cat will have learned to stop scratching your sofa., Although you are probably very frustrated with your cat scratching your sofa, physically punishing her will not solve the problem. In fact, it could make things worse because she will probably begin to perceive you in a negative light. A spritz or two of water is the most that you should do to punish her, but remember that this is not a long-term solution.Consider using a motion-activated can of compressed air such as Ssscat. Set this up to go off when the cat approaches the sofa. Instead of associating the unpleasant punishment with you (in which case the cat will just wait until you are not around to start scratching), it will seem like an "Act of God," which is a far more effective deterrent.  It is important to put the scratching post where your cat will be most likely to use it. Preferably, place the post where she typically scratches; given that she’s scratching your leather sofa, try placing the post by the sofa.It is also helpful to place the post in places where she normally frequents, such as her sleeping area or a particular window. If you put the scratching post in a corner or a place where she doesn’t normally go, it’s unlikely that she’ll use it.Cats often like to scratch when they first wake up, so having the post near her sleeping area will encourage her to scratch on the post., This means that, when your cat is scratching your sofa, you will physically pick her up and move her to one of her scratching posts.It may take time for her to understand why you are moving her, and she may not necessarily start scratching on the post when you move her. However, if she does start scratching on her post, reward her with a treat.By using positive reinforcement, she will be encouraged to use the scratching post instead of the sofa.  Sprinkling catnip leaves or powder onto the scratching post will encourage your cat to scratch on it. You can also try attaching one of her favorite toys to the post. When she plays with her toy, she will probably end up scratching the post, which will be a pleasurable experience for her., A good way to encourage your cat to use her scratching post is for you to spend time with her near the post. The more positive associations she has with the post, the more likely she will scratch on it., It may be tempting for you to physically move her paws to get her to scratch on the scratching post. Your cat will not appreciate you doing this, since she already knows how to scratch. Although you are trying to get her to stop scratching your sofa, you will still need to give her the space to scratch on her own.However, there is an argument for placing her front paws against the scratching post since this helps to transfer some of her scent, from scent glands on the back of the paws, onto the post, which makes it more appealing for her to return to.  

learn about scratching posts.  purchase a scratching post.  do not throw away the scratching post.  understand why cats scratch.  make your sofa an undesirable scratching post.  leave the undesirable items in place.  do not physically punish your cat.  position the scratching post.  re-direct your cat.  make the scratching post look and smell appealing.  feed and play with her by her post.  do not “teach” her how to scratch. 

 Before washing a doll's hair, make sure to remove any items from the hair. Dolls may have bows, bandanas, barrettes, or other accessories embedded in their hair.          If a doll has been in storage for a long time, it may have items tangled deep in its hair. Spend some time fishing through a doll's hair to check for accessories before washing the hair.  If you want to prevent hair from becoming tangled or damaged, brush out your doll's hair regularly. After you or your child plays with the doll, comb out the hair before putting it away for the day.          Comb a doll's hair as you would your own. Start at the bottom of the lock and work your way up to get out tangles., Styling a doll's hair can be fun. However, messing a doll's hair too much can lead to tangles and damage. Stick to simple styles, like braids and ponytails, rather than trying to emulate fancy hairdos you've seen on TV or in the movies. This will keep your doll's hair smooth and soft.  Before attempting to wash a doll's hair, read the manufacturer's instructions if you still have them. Some types of dolls come with special instructions for washing and hair care. American Girl dolls, for example, have hair that you should not wash on your own. The corporation provides a number you can call to ask for advice in the event your doll's hair is damaged., If a doll has mechanical parts, be careful before washing the doll's hair. Water can cause damage to a doll of this type. You may want to consider removing the hair or head, if possible, before washing. You can also wrap the doll's body in plastic wrap to protect it from water damage during the washing process.         

remove all items from the doll.  brush your doll's hair regularly.  avoid over-styling your doll's hair.  read manufacturer's instructions first, when possible.  be careful when washing dolls with mechanical parts. 

 The United Parcel Service has a variety of career paths from which you can choose. There are two basic career paths for a UPS employee who wants to work primarily in the field of physical labor: package handlers/helpers and drivers/mechanics.   Package handlers generally work part-time making sure sorting through packages and making sure they get to the proper addresses and that no damages are accrued on the journey. Shifts are somewhat short, about 4 to 5 hours each, and are dispersed throughout the day. Package handlers are often college students and parents looking to make extra money.UPS drivers are responsible for driving UPS trucks and delivering packages. This is a physical, fast-paced job where you'll be subject to regular physical exams and driving tests. Positions range from part to full time.; , Being in physical shape is important for certain positions, such as package handling and driving. You'll have to handle packages between 25 and 70 pounds as both a handler and a driver.   If you're not already physically active, work on exercising on a regular basis. The job of a handler is physically demanding. Even if you want to drive, keep in mind UPS often promotes from within. It may be easier to start off as a handler and work you way up to a drive position. Start working out on a regular basis to work on your muscles and stamina. Weight lifting should be a part of your workout regimen as UPS handlers have to be able to lift heavy packages. You should start slow with weigh training. Two 20 to 30 minute sessions a week, at first, will result in you seeing results. From there, you can work your way up to longer sessions and bigger weights.Make sure you learn the proper technique before beginning weigh training. Talk to a doctor or trainer about your goals with weight training. Allow him or her to talk to you about form and safety. You do not want to hurt yourself weight training.Always take a day to rest between weight training sessions. This gives your muscles time to recover from stress., There are no specific education requirements for UPS drivers and handlers. In fact, many handlers are college students looking for part time work. However, if you're aiming to eventually move up and become a driver consider getting a bachelor's or associate's degree in a field like automotive engineering. You can also look into vocational programs in car mechanics. This can make you a more employable candidate as you'll have basic working knowledge of vehicles you can use as a driver/mechanic.  If you want to drive for UPS, work on maintaining a excellent driving record. You might also need certifications from the Department of Transportation, depending on your career path.   All UPS drivers have to pass a physical exam to assure they can keep up with the physical demands of the job. Work to assure you're in shape prior to the exam.Certain positions require special certifications in addition to a driver's license. You may need a commercial driver's license. You might also need a certifications from the Department of Motor Vehicles if your job requires delivering certain materials, such as a Hazmat certification. If a job requires such certifications, it should say so in the job description., The UPS corporation often hires from within. This means you can move up from position to position. If you work hard as a handler, you may be promoted to a driver. Down the road, and if you get the proper education, you could potentially move from a driver position to a management or administrative position.  

learn about the available jobs.  get in shape physically.  consider your education.  gain necessary certifications and keep your driving record clean.  move up. 

 Pump up the wheels. Check to make sure your brakes, chain, and gear shifters are in good condition. Make sure the seat is at the right height for you, and if you plan on wearing clip-in shoes, make sure you have the right pedals on.; , Don't wear baggy trousers that can get caught in the chain. Comfy trainers or sporting shoes with grippy bottoms are great shoes to wear, while heels or spikes would not work so well. Wear a hoodie or a jumper that won't blow lots in the wind, and be ready to take it off when you get too hot.  You'll want that protection in case you get into any kind of accident.  Your arms, legs, and neck are particularly susceptible to sunburn while you're cycling.  Cycling is always more fun when you're with people you enjoy. Cycling in a larger group can also help keep you safe in case of any accident.  You'll need to keep yourself hydrated throughout your ride, and a bite to eat can provide much-needed energy towards the end of your ride.  Know the roads or bike paths you'll take and think about your destination.  Bring a cell phone and make sure it's charged. It's also a good idea to bring some money.  For example, if you're going to a picnic site, you might want to bring a pack lunch in a small backpack.  Enjoy the ride!  

get your bike ready.  dress appropriately.  make sure to wear your helmet.  wear sunscreen or other sun protection if necessary.  invite friends!,  pack plenty of water and snacks.  plan your route.  be prepared for emergencies.  bring anything else you might need while on your ride.  get going. 

 Once one partner loses faith in their partner it can take years to regain the trust that was lost. Any time a cheating partner leaves the house, meets up with coworkers, or texts someone new, feelings of jealousy and distrust are natural. Be prepared to work hard, and for several months, to rebuild trust after an affair.   Commit to healing your relationship, no matter how difficult things are from day to day, and you can one day rebuild the trust that was lost.  Avoid making excuses, blaming your partner, or dismissing the affair as “a one-time thing.” In order to ask for forgiveness and begin moving on you need to take ownership of your infidelity. By taking a good, hard look at yourself you can eventually realize what made you decide to cheat and find ways to avoid making the same mistake., This can be the most difficult thing to do after an affair, no matter which side of the relationship you are on. Asking for forgiveness, however, is the only way to start the healing process – you cannot move forward if your partner is still harboring feelings of resentment. While you might not get forgiveness immediately, you need to humble yourself and ask for it anyway.   You will likely have to ask for forgiveness multiple times, but you need to be honest and sincerely sorry for your transgressions.  If you cheated on your partner, the fastest way to regain trust is to be completely transparent. Make your schedule, calendar, and contacts accessible to your partner.Avoid hiding things, even small things, as they can lead to feelings of distrust.  You need to show that you are dependable again. Call when you say you will call, show up on time, and do the errands or chores like your promised every single time.Never make promises you can’t keep. If you need to change plans, change them several days in advance, giving your partner ample time to adjust their schedule as well.  Listen to what your partner needs from you to help mend the relationship. It may be more time together or more time apart. They could want you to come home from work earlier or stop drinking. No matter what it is, ask you partner “what can I do to help fix this” and listen to the answer without judgment.   This is not, however, and invitation for abuse. Be sincere, helpful, and loving, but do not let your partner abuse you out of "fairness" or revenge.  

know that it can take a long time to rebuild trust after cheating.  take responsibility for your mistakes.  ask for forgiveness.  become an open book.  keep all of your promises.  communicate about what your partner needs. 

 Find a good cave system until you hit bedrock. This is the lowest you can go in the world, and will help you know how deep you are when you're mining. Diamond ore is typically found in layers 1-15, with the highest concentration around layer 8.   Never, ever dig straight down, as you don't know what is underneath those blocks. You might fall into a dungeon or a pool of lava.  Once you hit bedrock, go back up until you're around level 8 and start your mine. Dig a central room about 2 blocks tall, 4 blocks long, and 4 blocks high.   Some players like to start the mine around layer 11. This will result in a slightly smaller chance of finding diamonds, but you are less likely to tunnel directly into a lava pit this way. Remember, diamonds usually spawn near lava. It is recommended that you create a chest in the central room of your mine so that you have a place to store excess ore as you build the mine., Dig a corridor 2 blocks high and at least 50 blocks long in each direction. These will be your starting branches. Walk down one of your corridors and start mining to the left and right every six blocks. This will maximize your efficiency the amount of blocks you can see as you mine.   , Diamonds are one of the rarest things in the game to find, E, and occur in less than 1% of the blocks in the lower levels. Finding diamonds is more of a game of luck than anything else, and patience is the most important thing to have when mining for them.   If you are lazy and don't want to do this much work, set off some TNT or craft the Wither. But it's best to go into Survival Mode before setting of any explosives. Also, using explosives can shorten your time mining but you might destroy some valuable ores like gold ores or the diamond ores you came for.(The Wither destroys any blocks in its way.)  

be a good miner in minecraft.  start your mine.  branch out.  keep digging. 

 There is no stable version of VBA for Mac or Linux, but the multi-emulator RetroArch includes the ability to load a stable VBA core (emulator) to play Game Boy Advance games.   Mac - Visit buildbot.libretro.com/stable/1.3.6/apple/osx/x86_64/ and download the "RetroArch.dmg" file. Linux - Open the Terminal and type sudo add-apt-repository ppa:libretro/stable.  In order to play GBA games in RetroArch, you'll need ROM files. ROMs are copies of GBA cartridges that the emulator reads to play the game. Downloading ROMs for games you don't own is illegal in many areas. You can download ROMs from many different locations online. One of the most popular is emuparadise.me   Visit emuparadise.me and open the "GBA ROMs" section. You can find a link in the Quick Links section of the main page. Browse for the game you want to download. You can also search for specific games. Click the "Download Links" link on the game's page. This will scroll down the page. Click the link that is displayed. Click the "Click here" link underneath the captcha to bypass it. Click the link in the "Direct Download" section. This will begin downloading the ROM file in ZIP format.  Placing all of your ROM files into a single, dedicated folder will make it easier to load them all in RetroArch. When RetroArch loads ROMs from a single folder, you'll get an easy-to-navigate list specialized for your emulated system. You can create a "GBA ROMs" folder in your User directory or anywhere else you'd like.   You don't need to unzip the ROM files to use them in RetroArch.  The process is different depending on whether you're using OS X or Linux:   Mac - Double-click the downloaded DMG file to open the installer. Drag the RetroArch application to the Applications folder icon. Linux - Open the Terminal and type sudo apt-get update. After running that command, type sudo apt-get install retroarch retroarch-* libretro-* and run it. After confirming, this will download and install RetroArch, which may take a while to complete., After adding RetroArch to your Applications folder, double-click it to start it up. The RetroArch Settings menu will load after a moment.   You can search for RetroArch in the Linux dashboard to quickly find it.  Before launching a game, you might want to adjust the default controller settings. RetroArch will automatically support most USB gamepads, but you can set which button is assigned to which input.   With the default control scheme, X will select and Z will go back. Return to the Settings menu and select "Input." Choose "User 1 Bind All." Follow the prompts to enter the keys or buttons you want to use for each input.  This will let you create a new column dedicated to your GBA games.  When you're in the ROMs directory, select "<Scan This Directory>". This will add all of your GBA ROMs from that directory to your list of games., Once you've scanned your ROMs folder, you'll see a list of all of your games in the new "Game Boy Advance" category.  This will load the game using the VBA-M emulator. You can try the other emulators on the list, such as mGBA, if VBA-M isn't giving you good performance.  

download retroarch.  download some rom files.  put all of your gba roms into their own folder (optional).  install the retroarch application.  run retroarch.  change your default controls.  scroll to the "+" column.  select "scan directory" and then navigate to your roms directory.  select your game from the new "game boy advance" category.  select "run" and then "game boy advance (vba-m)." 

 If you do not have all three side lengths, you cannot use the Pythagorean Theorem to determine whether the triangle is right.  For example, you might be given a triangle with side lengths of 8, 9, and 12 cm, and you need to determine whether the triangle is right.    , The formula is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where c{\displaystyle c} is the length of the hypotenuse, and a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} are the lengths of the other sides of the triangle., The hypotenuse is the longest side of a right triangle, so whatever measurement is largest will stand for the variable c{\displaystyle c}.  For example, if the side lengths of a triangle are are 8, 9, and 12 cm, you would use the measurement of 12 for the potential hypotenuse, because it’s the longest side. So, your formula will look like this: a2+b2=122{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=12^{2}}.  It does not matter which value is a{\displaystyle a} and which value is b{\displaystyle b}.  For example, if the other two side lengths are 8 and 9 centimeters, your formula will look like this: 82+92=122{\displaystyle 8^{2}+9^{2}=12^{2}}.  Remember that squaring a number means to multiply it by itself.  For example:82+92=122{\displaystyle 8^{2}+9^{2}=12^{2}}64+81=144{\displaystyle 64+81=144}   , If this sum is equal to the square of the hypotenuse, the triangle is right. If the two sides of the equation are not equal, the triangle is not right.For example:64+81=144{\displaystyle 64+81=144}145=144{\displaystyle 145=144}Since the equation is not true, the triangle is not right.   

ensure that you have the measurements for all three sides of the triangle.  write the formula for pythagoras’s theorem.  plug the length of the potential hypotenuse into the formula.  plug the values of the other two sides into the equation.  square all of the numbers.  add the square of the two sides. 

 Many funeral homes, while not accepting payment terms, will negotiate in good faith for deferred payment if you can provide enough information to show them that they will undoubtedly get paid after probate proceedings conclude., If a surprise passing leaves little to no money left for funeral expenses in the deceased’s estate, splitting the bills amongst family helps defray the costs so that no one person is left paying for the whole thing. Get together and plan the funeral so that the overall budget fits into each person’s share.Since not everyone makes the same amount of money, you can weight the shares contributed so that those family members who can afford more pay more.  Oftentimes people belong to organizations or groups that provide support for one another in different ways. Artists, churches, businesses, and others will lend a hand to help raise money to defray the costs for things such as medical bills and funerals. With websites like Indiegogo and Kickstarter, there are easy ways to set up pages for those to donate what they can to help.These usually take some time to set up and generate donations so you will have to rely on the deceased’s family, friends, and connections to spread the word quickly in order to raise the amount of money you need in a short period of time.  The HR department will have all the information for benefits that were part of the deceased’s benefits package. If he/she was a member of a union they too may have benefits to help cover or defray funeral costs.  If the deceased was killed in an accident or a victim of a crime, you may be able to procure assistance. 

using the deceased’s estate.  split the costs among family.  throw a fundraiser.  call the deceased’s employer.  look into accident or victim compensation. 

 In order to lose weight, you'll need to cut down on some extra calories in your diet. Lower-calorie diets can help you lose 5 pounds in an appropriate amount of time.   Cutting out about 500 calories a day will help you lose about 1–2 pounds per week. You may also choose to cut out 750 calories daily to help you lose weight slightly faster.Although cutting calories helps induce weight loss, eating too few calories or eating under 1200 calories daily is not safe or considered healthy weight loss. You'll be at increased risk for nutrient deficiencies, fatigue, loss of lean muscle mass and slow weight loss long-term.Use a food journal or food journal app to calculate how many calories you typically consume. Subtract 500–750 calories from this number to get a new upper limit that might help you lose weight. If you subtract 500 calories and you get a value less than 1,200, use 1,200 calories as your limit. You can burn additional calories through exercise.; , Protein and fiber help to boost metabolism and keep you feeling satisfied longer.   Studies have shown that higher protein diets (and higher protein meals) can help you stay satisfied, reduce your appetite and help fuel weight loss.Start your day with a higher protein breakfast to help keep grazing and snacking to a minimum. Like protein, fiber also helps you feel more satisfied longer. In addition, it helps to provide bulk to your meals so you may be able to feel satisfied with less foods.Examples of higher protein, high fiber breakfasts include: 2 egg omelet with low-fat cheese and sauteed vegetables or 1 cup fat-free Greek yogurt with 1/2 cup (28g) of raspberries.  In addition to filling up on protein at breakfast, include a serving of lean protein at each meal.   Protein is a great nutrient for weight loss. When eaten regularly throughout the day, it can help decrease appetite, fuel your metabolism and manage your overall energy levels.One serving of protein is about 3–4 oz (21-28g). This is also about the size of a deck of cards.Including a serving at each meal and snack can help you meet your minimum daily needs. Lean protein foods are not only high in protein, but also low in calories which can help support weight loss. Try: seafood, poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, lean beef or legumes.  To help keep you feeling satisfied and add volume to your meals, fill up on five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables each day.   Both fruits and vegetables are lower in calories, but high in a variety of essential nutrients. They can add a significant amount of bulk and volume to your meals to help you feel more satisfied with fewer calories.Try to eat one serving of fruit plus one or two servings of vegetables at each meal. This will help you meet the recommended five to nine servings daily. Also track your portions. Aim for 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of leafy greens or 1/2 cup of fruit (or one small piece)., 100% whole grains are a nutritious addition to your diet. They provide fiber, vitamins and minerals to your diet.Although whole grains are healthy, moderating how much you eat during the day and over the course of the week can help you lose weight. Studies have shown that those people who eat fewer carbohydrates (especially from carb rich foods like pasta, white rice, bread and baked goods) can lose more weight faster. Include only one to two servings of grains daily. This can allow you to enjoy these nutritious foods but also still lose weight. Measure out appropriate servings of these foods. Aim for 1 oz or 1/2 cup of whole grains per serving.Try oatmeal or quinoa.  Liquid calories can pack on weight quickly. Studies have shown that sweetened beverages add a significant amount of excess calories to your diet and can lead to weight gain long-term.Cutting out lattes, smoothies, sugary coffee drinks, sports drinks, soda and alcoholic beverages will significantly reduce your calorie intake. Many health professionals consider these types of beverages as "empty calories," that give no nutritional benefit.Increase your water or clear fluid (like flavored water or decaf unsweetened tea) intake to replace calorie-containing liquids. Aim for about eight to 13 8-oz glasses (2–2.5 litres) of these types of no calorie beverages each day to help you maintain proper hydration., These low-nutrient foods can make you pack on extra pounds or prevent you from losing weight. Limiting these foods can help you lose 5 pounds more quickly.Limit or cut out highly processed foods like: frozen TV dinners, canned soups, processed meats, canned pastas, chips, crackers and pretzels. Also limit or cut out processed sweets and sugars like those found in ice cream, candy, cookies, pastries and sweetened beverages. Instead, grab a piece of fruit to satisfy your sweet tooth.  This should include a warm up and cool down, then periods of medium intensity interspersed with periods of high-intensity, such as sprints.   There are more weight-loss and metabolism-boosting benefits with interval training than working out at the same intensity for 45 minutes. You have increased fat burn and increased metabolism long after the workout has been completed.If you can oversee your own intervals, then use a treadmill, gym cycle, stair stepper, elliptical, rowing machine or go swimming. Do one to two minutes sprinting and spend two to four minutes recovering. Try downloading an app that will alert you when to switch from high- to low-intensity. If you are unsure how to begin interval training, sign up for a cardiovascular gym class. Good choices for losing weight quickly are boot camp, cardio burn, and spinning.  Make sure you do at least 30 minutes of weight training at one time to boost your metabolism and gain lean muscle.Seek out professional advice from an exercise specialist, personal trainer, kinesiologist, or physiotherapist before engaging in a serious weight training regime.   Do 30 minutes of squats, lunges, push ups, pull ups, planks, or other body weight exercises. You can choose to do this at home, at the gym on machines or as part of a class that uses hand weights and body weight exercises. Research alternative methods through personal training videos online or sign up for several sessions with a personal trainer to start losing weight. Always include a day off in between weight lifting. This allows your muscles to rest and recovery from being worked with weights.  You can burn 100-200 or more extra calories with a walk on your lunch break, after work, after dinner or right when you wake up. This can aid in supporting quicker weight loss.Buy a pedometer and ensure you are taking at least 10,000 steps per day. Doctors recommend an activity level of 10,000 to 12,000 steps to remain healthy. An increase in steps may also help you shed a few extra lbs (or kilos). If you don't have time for a 30 minute walk, trying walking three times a day for 10 minutes a session.  If you aren't getting seven to nine hours of sleep a night, then your sleep habits may actually be working against your goal to lose weight.   Increasing sleep may help balance hormones, boost metabolism and increase weight loss.In addition, adequate sleep helps to regulate your appetite. When you're sleep deprived you might feel more hungry and be more susceptible to making poor choices. Aim for at least seven to nine hours of sleep nightly.Go to bed earlier or wake up later if you can.  

cut down on calories.  eat a protein and fiber-filled breakfast every day.  include a serving of protein at each meal.  fill up on fruits and vegetables.  include whole grains.  replace your liquid calories with water.  limit processed foods, sugar and refined carbohydrates from your diet.  do 30 minutes of interval-based cardiovascular activity every day.  weight train every other day.  add a 30 minute walk into your day.  increase your sleep. 

 If you need to share files with Windows or Mac computers, you will be much more successful using Samba.; , When sharing files with NFS, there are two side: the server and the clients. The server is the computer that is actually storing the files, while the clients are the computers that are accessing the shared folder by mounting the shared folder as a virtual drive. NFS will need to be configured on both the server and any client that wants to connect.  This is the computer that will be hosting the shared files. The server computer will need to be turned on and logged in in order for clients to mount the shared folder. NFS requires using the terminal to install and configure both the server and client.  This will begin downloading and installing the NFS files on your computer.  Select "No" from the menu that appears. This will enable other computers on the network to connect to your shared folder.  This will ensure that your changes take effect.  This is an empty directory that will direct the clients to the actual shared directory. This will allow you to change the shared directory on your server later without having to make any changes to the clients.   Type .mkdir -p /export/dummyname and press ↵ Enter. This will create a directory named dummyname that the clients will see.  This will open the /etc/fstab file and allow you to automatically mount the shared drive whenever the server boots up.  Replace sharedpath with the location of the shared drive, and replace dummypath with the location of the dummy directory you created earlier.   For example, to share the /dev/sdb drive with the clients using the dummy directory created earlier, you would type /dev/sdb /export/Shared none bind 0 0. Save the changes to the file.  You will need to add your dummy directory as well as the IPs that are allowed to access it to this file. Use the following format to share with all the IP addresses on your local network: /export/dummyname 192.168.1.1/24(rw,no_root_squash,async).,,,, You can name this whatever you'd like. For example, you can type mkdir /sharedFiles to create a folder called "sharedFiles". , Replace serverIP with the IP address of the NFS server computer. Replace sharedDirectory with the dummy directory you created on the NFS server and the local directory you just created. Leave the rest of the values as they are for now.   Using the above examples, the line might look like: 192.168.1.5:/export/Shared /sharedFiles nfs rsize=8192,wsize=8192,timeo=14,intr.  The drive will automatically mount each time the computer reboots.  Type mount -a and then ls /sharedFiles to see if the shared files are displayed.

 Start by removing any old nail polish and cleaning your nails. Next, trim and file your nails into a shape that you like. Finish off by pushing back your cuticles and applying a little cuticle oil.  When you are done with your nails, simply wipe the petroleum jelly away, along with any mistakes. You can also use white school glue instead, but be sure to let the glue dry first.  This is a must, even if you plan on using light-colored nail polish. The base coat will not only protect your nails against potential staining, but also help the manicure last longer.  Choose a neutral color, such as brown, beige, or tan. This way, your background won't be competing with the glitter or the leaves. Alternatively, you can also use white, black, ivory, or cream., For best results, choose glitter nail polish with finger grains, rather than chunky ones. Warm colors, such as gold or copper, would work best for this method.  Start by tapping the glitter onto the top fourth of each nail, then the top third, and finally the top half. This will create a gradient or ombre effect, with the glitter being thickest on the tips of your nails, and fading towards the middle., This will help smooth down the glitter layer, and make painting the leaves in the next step a lot easier.  Choose fall colors, such as red, orange, or yellow. For now, just paint 1 or 2 short, straight lines on each nail. These lines will eventually become your leaves.Don't let the lines go past the glitter area. You can have some of the lines touch the edge of your nails, however. Try different angles for the lines. This will give your leaves more movement. Clean your brush with nail polish remover and blot it dry on a paper towel before dipping it into a new color.  Using the same brush and colors as before, paint the rest of the leaves. Use short, angled strokes radiating from the straight lines you painted earlier. By now, your leaves should start looking a little like maple or oak leaves.Remember to clean your brush before dipping it into a new color!  , At this point, you can draw some veins using a darker shade of the same color. You can also add splotches of another color to each leaf. Try to use the same fall colors as before, however. For example, you could add orange splotches to a yellow leaf, or red splotches to an orange leaf., Let your nails dry, then apply another layer of top coat, if needed.  If you added any petroleum jelly to your cuticle area, now is the time to wipe it away. If you used white school glue instead, simply peel it away. Finally, use a thin brush or Q-tip dipped in nail polish remover to clean up the cuticle area and to wipe away any stray glitter.  

prep your nails.  consider coating the cuticle area with petroleum jelly to make clean-up easier.  apply a base coat.  apply 1 to 2 coats of your base color to each nail.  dip a makeup sponge into some glitter nail polish.  pat the glitter onto the tip of each nail to create an ombre effect, going no more than halfway up your nail.  apply a top coat.  start painting 1 to 2 leaves on the tip of each nail with a thin, pointed brush or striper brush.  finish painting the base of the leaves.  add some details.  finish off with a top coat.  clean up your work. 

, You can also access the properties window by holding ALT+SPACE+P. Notice the four tabs at the top of the properties dialogue box: Options, Font, Layout, Colors.  This will enable you to use the "copy and paste" function in the command prompt window.  It is also recommended that you select "Discard Old Duplicates".  You will see two sets of options: "Window size" and "Screen buffer size".    Window size controls the size of the window you're working with.  Screen buffer size controls what's kept in your computer's buffer memory while you're running the command prompt, which can be up to 9999. It can be viewed using the scroll bar on the side of the window.  A width of 80 and height of 300 is a common buffer size.  As you will see, there's an additional frame where you can edit the colors more specifically by their numeric values. For example, you can choose a darker green than you already have access to by plugging in: red:0, green:100, blue:0.  This is where you choose the font you would like to use. You will see two fonts: Raster fonts (as default) and Lucida Console. With this initial step, however, you only have these two fonts available to you. But don't worry, the next step allows you to add new fonts.  Press OK. , Right-click on "TrueTypeFont" key, click "New" and then click "String Value".  For the next values, just enter a "0" each time. For example, the third value should be named "000" and so on. Please note that you have to name them exactly as shown; otherwise, the function won't work. , You should be able to see the new font(s) under the "Font" tab in the properties window the next time you run command prompt.  This means that all changes will be gone as soon as you close the current command prompt. "Save properties for future windows with same title". Selecting this option will save your changes for all command prompt windows running from the same shortcut. In other words, this is the proper option to set the properties for this specific shortcut.  Using this window, however, will affect every command prompt, no matter where it's running from.  

to open command prompt, click "start", "run", type "cmd" (without the quotes) and press ok.;  ,  right-click on the top (the title bar) of the command prompt window and select "properties".  when you open the "options" tab, check "quick edit mode".  click on the "layout" tab.  set a proper buffer size according to how much space you will need to keep at any given time.  choose the color of your text, background screen, and pop-up windows by selecting the "colors" tab.  open the "font" tab.  to add new fonts, click "start", "run" and type "regedit" (without the quotes).  go to this key: "\hkey_local_machine\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\console\truetypefont\".  ,  before you proceed please take a look at the "warnings" section below.  enter "00" (without the quotes) as the name of the new value you just created.  now, double-click on the value you created and write the font name in the "value data" bar (for example, "courier new").  ,  close "registry editor" and reboot your computer.  to save changes, after you press "ok" in the properties window, choose one of the following options:  "apply properties to current window only".  right-click on the top of the command prompt window (the title bar) and click "defaults", which will give you have access to a window like the properties window. 

 The expression of strong, negative feelings rarely helps a relationship. If you are often frustrated or angry at a particular person, a calm discussion is much more likely to be productive. Step away until you've calmed down.  Start your discussion by talking about a single issue, such as a specific action or repeated behavior that frustrates you.Try to stay focused on this topic until you've seriously discussed it. Talking about possible underlying causes or related actions is allowed, but try to avoid turning the discussion into a list of things that irritate you.   Try to agree with the person at the outset that you’ll both stay focused on the issue at hand.  Allow the other person an opportunity to speak uninterrupted and to be heard. Try to listen intently to the other person, and then decide how to respond rather than responding impulsively. If you find this difficult, try repeating the other person's words silently to yourself to keep yourself focused, and keep your face and body aligned toward the other person.For instance, if you’re having a relationship fight, make it a point not to interrupt the person. Allow him or her to finish a point before responding and consider your response rather than going with your gut reaction.  This will demonstrate that you understand what the other person said, give the other person a chance to consider what he or she said, and clear up some ambiguities in the discussion. This can be a very difficult step because actually listening to the other person—instead of thinking of your next thing to say—can be a tricky thing to do.   For instance, if a friend says that you never make time for her, repeat it back and ask, “Do you really think that I never make time for you?” This can allow the friend to hear the complaint as you did.  Have an honest discussion about how you feel, and what you want to change, and ask the other person for honest opinions as well.Refrain from making insults or hurtful comments. Use sentences that start with "I" to talk about how you feel, and avoid sentences with “you,” which can often sound accusatory.Avoid passive-aggressive behavior, such as hiding your real emotions or insulting someone behind his or her back. Avoid sarcasm or insults during this discussion, even as a joke.  These are words such as ‘always’, 'anyone', 'nobody' and ‘never.’ These words invite the person to become defensive by invalidating the your unworkable pronouncements, and causing both of you to fall short.   For example, don’t say, ”You never take out the trash!” Instead try, “You take out the trash less often than we agreed.”  , Try to reach a compromise that you are both satisfied with. Writing down a list of ideas together can sometimes help. You don't need to come up with a perfect answer on the first discussion, either. If necessary, make it clear that the solution you decide on is temporary, and set a time to discuss it in a couple weeks to see whether it is working.   If you’re frustrated that the friend hasn’t repaid a debt, for instance, see if you can compromise with a payment plan rather than just simply being frustrated that you can’t get all of the money back at once.  Thank the other person when making an effort to change his or her behavior. Even small changes—smaller than you would like—may lead to more change if you just encourage the person.   Using the same example of frustration over a friend owing you money, tell the friend how much it means that he has agreed to a payment plan or even agreed to sit down and talk about it again when he might be able to enter a payment agreement. By validating the friend’s effort, you’re more likely to see future cooperation.  

do not talk while you’re still angry.  bring up one issue at a time.  give the other person opportunities to respond.  mirror back what you heard, in your own words.  be honest but compassionate.  avoid using absolutes on other people.  brainstorm solutions with the other person.  show appreciation for effort. 

 For this project, you will need a pair of shorts, rubber gloves, some water, bleach, and a bit of soap. You will also need a plastic bucket or tub that is large enough to comfortably fit the shorts. If you do not have any shorts, you can make your own by cutting the legs off of a pair of pants.   For a more dramatic ombre effect, consider using darker denim. A pants hanger is not necessary, but it could help weigh the shorts down as you are dipping them into the bleach.  Make a mark on the fabric using a washable fabric marking pen.  The best place to work would be outside, but if this is not possible, you can work indoors with a window open. Having a fan on in the room would also aid ventilation.  Although you will be working with diluted bleach, you still want to protect your hands. Bleach is caustic and can burn your skin if you are not careful.  You will need one part liquid bleach and one part water. How much bleach and water you use will depend on the size of your tub and the shorts.  Dip the shorts 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) below the mark you have made. The bleach will eventually creep up the shorts the rest of the way and reach the mark.Consider folding the shorts in half and clipping them onto a pants hanger. This will allow you to pull them out of the bleach solution more easily. The weight of the hanger will also prevent the shorts from falling into the bleach solution., You should start to see some fading during this time. If you are working with a darker-colored pair of shorts, then you may leave them in the bleach solution for a few more minutes.  After about ten minutes, take the shorts out of the water and rinse them using fresh, cool water. This will make the fading smoother.If you wish to make dip-dyed shorts, do not take them out of the bleach solution. Simply leave them in the bleach solution until you have achieved the lightness you want. Dip-dyed shorts have a more defined line than ombre shorts.  For a more dramatic ombre effect, put the shorts back into the bleach solution, but only partway. Do not dip them as deeply as you did the first time. This way, you are lightening the bottom portion of the shorts even more, thus creating the ombre effect.  Squeeze the shorts to get the extra moisture out, and rinse them using soap and cool water until you cannot smell the bleach anymore. The soap will help prevent the bleach from making yellow stains.  You can do this by leaving them out in the sun, or by tossing them into the dryer.  

gather your supplies.  decide how high you want the ombre to go.  place the tub in a well-ventilated area.  put on the rubber gloves.  fill the tub with bleach and water.  put the shorts into the bleach solution.  leave the shorts in the solution for ten minutes.  take the shorts out of the bleach solution and rinse them.  return the shorts to the bleach solution.  pull the shorts out of the bleach solution and rinse them.  dry the shorts. 

 LinkedIn is very good at helping you:   Find candidates with very specific skill sets Target people from specific companies Reach out to people who are not currently looking for a job. (Passive job seekers.) Hit up contacts of contacts. It is good for helping find friends of current employees.  You won't do as well using LinkedIn to find people with:   Very general skills. New college graduates Hourly employees  , When you contact someone via LinkedIn, it will be natural for them to check out your company profile first thing, so you want them to find the information there helpful and putting the company in the best light.   Search LinkedIn to see your current company profile. For example, the wikiHow entry is here: https://www.linkedin.com/company/wikihow. Look at the "Careers" section in particular. If the company profile is not to your liking, ask the right person at your company to update it. Your marketing people may have specific thoughts as to the content, so you want to keep them in the loop. If there is no company profile, set it up from the Companies>Add a Company. You can then follow the prompts to verify your identity and fill out the sections for Overview, Careers, Product Pages, Employees and Statistics. Obviously, the part you want to flesh out is the "Careers" section.  You can simply pay to list a job on LinkedIn without a recruiter account. It is not cheap, but will get you applicants. The quality of the applicants will be somewhat better than what you can find on Craigslist.   Similar to Craigslist, a job posting will be not as effective to recruit people in very high demand. It will be effective if you have a specific skill set that lends itself to keyword search. As an example, if you want to hire a copy-editor in Sydney, you will find people can find you easily and apply. You have to ask yourself if you will get too many applicants (Salesperson in London) or no applicants (actuary in Marfa, Texas.)  , Recruiter accounts are very effective if you are trying to reach out to specific people. They are rather unmatched if you are trying to find people who are not currently looking for a job.   Recruiter accounts are expensive. The most powerful version approaches USD$10,000 per year. You can find just the right person you are looking for, and contact them with a "LinkedIn InMail." InMails are opened most of the time; much more frequently than regular emails. Some people don't check their LinkedIn, though, so you probably want to follow with a regular email or phone call. Reaching out to people who are not looking for a job can be amazingly effective in finding highly qualified candidates. Naturally, it will take longer, but you may find better people. You also will see who viewed your profile, so you can tell which candidates are interested and you can follow up with them. The hillbilly version of using LinkedIn for cheap is to find the person you are looking for on LinkedIn search, but then to contact them off of LinkedIn. LinkedIn is making that harder by hiding the family names of the people you are searching for. With a recruiter account, you see the person's full name and can contact them directly with an InMail.  You will be amazed how quickly you can find people who know any candidate.   Check up on the references your candidate provided, to ensure they are who they are who the candidate said they are. Find "backdoor" references using LinkedIn. Search for people with similar jobs at the company your job candidate came from, and you can find and reach out to people who can give you the true scoop about him or her. Ignore the recommendations about your candidate on LinkedIn. They are useless; in fact, glowing recommendations mean nothing more than the candidate has been trying to get good recommendations. The skills and expertise section is rarely helpful. It can be inaccurate, it might give you clues only if the candidate is stressing a skillset they don't really have.  

know what kind of candidates can best be found via linkedin.  know what kinds of candidates for which linkedin doesn't work as well.  ensure your company profile is set up and looks good.  post a job on linkedin.  sign up for a linkedin recruiter account.  know that linkedin is very effective in background checks.

 You can fry, bake, or microwave these corn tortilla chips. If you plan on frying or baking the chips, though, you should preheat the cooking elements before preparing the chips.   If frying your chips, pour 1/4 inch (1.25 cm) of cooking oil into a dry skillet with a heavy bottom and deep sides. Heat the oil on medium high until it reaches a temperature of 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius). Do not allow the oil to begin smoking, however. If baking the chips, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).  Corn tortilla chips made from tortilla shells are easier to fry if they are completely dry. If you plan on baking or microwaving the chips, though, you do not need to worry about drying the tortillas out first.   Open the package of tortillas and spread them out in a single layer on a clean kitchen counter. Let them dry for several hours to overnight. Alternatively, dry them in the microwave. Lay the tortillas out in a single layer on a paper towel and microwave for 20 to 60 seconds. They should only be dry when finished, not crisp.  Use a pizza cutter or sharp kitchen knife to cut each tortilla into six equal wedges. Cut the tortilla in half, then divide each half into three even pieces, working out from the center point.   These wedges should be fairly triangular in shape. You can experiment with other shapes and sizes, as well, including strips or smaller wedges. Keep in mind that the sizes of your chips should be fairly equal to ensure an even cook time for each batch.  As stated previously, these chips can be fried, baked, or microwaved.   To fry the chips, place a handful of your wedges into the hot oil, keeping them to a single layer. Fry for 2 minutes or until the chips deepen in color and become hard. Remove the chips with a slotted spoon or tongs and line them up on a plate covered with layers of clean paper towel.  Keep an eye on the temperature of the oil as you fry your chips. When you add your chips to the oil, the temperature will drop. When you remove the chips, the temperature will rise. Adjust the temperature controls of your oven accordingly to maintain an even temperature of 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).   To bake the chips, spread the wedges out onto a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil or parchment paper. Keep them in a single layer. Bake for 6 minutes, then turn them over using tongs and bake for another 6 to 9 minutes. The chips are done once they become firm and start to deepen in color. To microwave the chips, line the microwave with paper towels and spread the chips out over the paper towels in a single layer. Microwave for 30 seconds to 2 minutes, or until the chips look crispy but not burnt.  Sprinkle the chips with salt, to taste, as soon as they finish cooking. Let them cool to room temperature and enjoy.  

preheat the oil or oven.  dry the tortilla shells.  cut each tortilla into wedges.  cook the chips.  season with salt and serve. 

 Role-playing your study content may motivate you to keep studying. Plus, role-playing may offer a richer understanding of the subject matter as opposed to simply reading or memorizing key dates or terms.Exercise your creativity and devise a way to act out your studies. Invite some peers to join you—just remember to stay on task. For instance, if you are learning about war in history, you might act out one of the key battles.  Your instructor might advise against doodling during class, but this activity might help you outside of the classroom. Drawing out your subject matter may actually lead to retaining more information. Plus, doodling as you read makes the task more enjoyable., Another way to add interest to your study time is by singing about the subject matter. You might generate a sing-song rhyme to explain the rules of language arts or mathematics. Or, you might take your studies further and develop a jingle when learning about persuasive arguments in speech., You probably watch YouTube videos to learn new skills or to have a laugh. You can also take advantage of this sort of media for your study time. Doing so can make your learning more engaging. Plus, you might even find a new way of viewing the subject matter. 

act it out.  draw pictures.  create a song.  watch relevant youtube videos on the subject.

 Set boundaries with your parent and determine how much you want to be involved in and connected to their life. Different people and different situations demand different boundaries, so the only person who can tell you what’s best for you is yourself (perhaps with the input of your partner, close friend, or therapist).You may decide that you are only comfortable seeing your parent occasionally, perhaps only at family events where their presence is diffused. You may only feel comfortable communicating via phone or email with your parent, and not be comfortable seeing them in person. If you have children, you may wish to limit your parent’s contact with them. You may decide to agree to letting your parent see them only while you are present, and say no to offers of babysitting and overnights, for example.  Let your parent know what they can expect from you and what, in turn, you expect from them. Indicate what the consequences will be if they do not adhere to your expectations.You could say, “I have decided to come home for Christmas. If you are verbally abusive to me during our visit, I will call you out on it, and then I will leave.” Do not be afraid to let your parent to know your limits. Going into a situation with clear expectations can help avoid hurt feelings and confusion. You could say, “I know that we have had our problems in the past. When I visit next week, I want to be clear with you about what I will tolerate.”, Refuse to get more involved with your parent than you are comfortable. If you are uncomfortable setting limits, remember how you may become angry and resentful otherwise.Find ways to say no. Figure out how you are comfortable saying no, but make sure it is firm and leaves no room for misunderstanding. You could say, “I’m sorry, Mom, but that’s not going to work,” or “No, unfortunately I can’t make that event.” If you are not comfortable saying no directly, you could offer something in exchange that you are willing to do. For example, “Mom, I can’t help you move on Saturday, but I can come over the following week and help you unpack for a few hours,” or “No, taking the kids out for pizza won’t work, but you are welcome to come over for dinner next week.”  , Prior to an encounter, decide how you can keep yourself emotionally “safe” from your parent’s harm. These will be different for every person and depend on the situation. If you are in therapy, you may wish to discuss strategies with your therapist.If your parent lives nearby and you are visiting them for the day, you may wish to set a time limit for your visit. You could tell your parent, “We need to leave by two o’clock.” If you are visiting your parent from out of town, you could insist on getting a hotel while you are visiting, in order to get some physical distance and recovery time from the toxic environment. You may decide to leave right away if your parent is being verbally abusive or is engaging in substance abuse, giving them no second chances.  If they have “disowned” you or you are estranged from them for some reason, respect their boundaries and give them the space they want. It may be extremely painful, even though you have consistently been treated poorly by your parent throughout your life. If this is the case, consider finding a therapist to help you work through conflicting emotions.Put it in perspective. Even though it is painful to be estranged from your family, think of how the space will allow you to get some freedom and grow into your own, stronger person. Give it time. Your parent may wish to communicate with you at some point down the road. Stay hopeful, but let the ball remain in their court. Let your parent initiate contact if they initiated the disconnect.  

decide your level of involvement.  communicate your boundaries to your parent.  learn to say no.  implement self-care strategies when seeing your parent.  keep your distance.

 A French braid is a classic hairstyle which is very quick and easy once you get the hang of it. It is perfect for school mornings as it looks pretty but will also keep your little girl's hair looking neat and tidy throughout the day.   Take a section of hair from the top center of her head, just above the forehead. Divide it into three evenly-sized strands, just as you would with a normal braid. Hold two sections in your right hand and one section in your left hand. Cross the section in your left hand into the center of the other two, then cross the outside section in your right hand into the center of the other two -- just as you would with a normal braid. Continue braiding in this fashion, but before you cross over each strand grab a new piece of hair from the loose hair on same side of your head and join it with the strand that's crossing over. The smaller the strands, the more intricate your French braids will be. Keep incorporating new hair until all of the hair has been picked up, then finish with a normal braid and tie with an elastic.  Variation: Make a neat center parting them braid the hair on either side of the parting to create pigtail French braids.  The fishtail braid is easier to master than the French braid, but still looks intricate and beautiful.   Sweep your little girl's hair to the side of her head and tie a low ponytail with a small elastic. Divide the hair in two. Take a thin strand of hair from the outside of the left section. Bring it over the left section and under the right section, combining it with the hair in the right section. Next take a thin strand of hair from the outside of the right section. Bring it over the right section and under the left section, combining it with the hair in the left section. Continue doing this for as long as possible. When you reach the thin hair at the bottom of the ponytail, you may need to switch to a normal braid. You can make the strands as small or as large as you like -- using thinner strands will take longer, but will result in a more intricate-looking braid. Try to keep the strands of hair as evenly sized as possible, as this will make the finished braid look neater. Tie the end with a small elastic. You can leave the braid as it is, or you can carefully cut the elastic at the top of the hair for a looser braid.  Variation: Once you've mastered the fishtail technique, you can try doing a French fishtail braid. This starts out like a regular French braid, but turns into a fishtail braid once all of the hair has been picked up.  This simple hairstyle looks adorable on little girls with very long hair -- it will make them feel like beautiful princesses!   Pull hair into a high, tight ponytail on the back of the head. Divide the hair into two halves. Do a basic braid in one half, securing with a small elastic. Twist the other half, then wrap the braided hair around the twisted hair. secure at the end with a small elastic.Variation: Wrap a bow around the top of the ponytail for added princess-factor!  , This cute hairstyle involves twisting a braid around itself to make a flower shape. The braided flower makes a nice alternative to hair bows and plastic flowers.   Pull hair into a nice tight ponytail, either at the back or side of the head. Separate a section of hair from the top of the ponytail and do a basic braid all the way to the end, securing with a small elastic. Start twisting the braid around itself, making sure to keep the braid flat so the pattern is visible. After each rotation, discretely secure the braid with a bobby bin. When you get to the unbraided section at the end, twist the air and tuck it beneath the finished flower, securing with a bobby pin.  Variation: Leave the hair loose, then do three of these braided flowers in a row along the back of her head or in a cluster above one of her ears., This is a pretty hairstyle you can do on little girls with long hair. It looks like a braided headband going across the top of her head.   Part hair down the middle then make a second parting from ear to ear, so the hair is split into four sections. Take a small section of hair from behind the ear on the right side of her head. Do a basic braid all the way down to the end, then secure with a small elastic. Pull the braid over the top of the head and secure with a couple of bobby pins behind the left ear (or slightly higher, if necessary). Make sure it is secured nice and tight, so the braid doesn't slide off the top of her head. Take the loose front section of hair on the right side of her head and twist it inwards (towards her head). Pull it to the back of her head so it covers the starting point of the braid. Clip to temporarily secure. Do the same on the left side of her head to cover the end of the braid and the bobby pins. Remove the clip and tie the two twisted sections together with a small elastic. Cover the elastic with a pretty hair bow or flower clip.  Variation: You can also make a double braided headband by doing a second braid starting on the left side of her head and pulling it towards the right.

!, you may want to choose the "Mushroom Cup" as it is the most basic and easiest to learn of all the circuits. Then you want to choose the 50cc level, because 100cc and 150cc are much more challenging. These "cc" levels determine how easy your kart is to control, so, the lower the number the easier your kart is to navigate.; , It's true, the racer you choose will affect what kind of kart you can drive, but we'll get to that later. There are three kinds of drivers you can choose from: Light, Medium, and Heavy. Light drivers can ride in any kind of kart. Medium weight drivers can ride in medium karts and heavy karts. And Heavy characters can only ride in karts that are heavy as well, so choose wisely.  Light Characters: Diddy Kong, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Koopa Troopa, ParaTroopa, Bowser Jr., Toad, Toadette.       Medium Characters: Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Yoshi, Birdo, Waluigi.       Heavy Characters: Donkey Kong, Bowser, Wario, Petey Piranha, King Boo.  Depending on your selection, you will be able to race in certain karts.  Light Karts: Have good acceleration but lower overall top speeds. Only light characters can ride in these karts.       Medium Karts: Average in all aspects of racing. Light and Medium characters can ride in these.       Heavy Karts: Have poor acceleration but have the highest overall top speeds. Heavy, Medium, and Light characters can ride in Heavy Karts.  In the game, there are 16 courses divided up into 4 cups: Mushroom, Flower, Star, and Special. Each cup holds 4 tracks and you have to select the entire cup to play in Grand Prix mode, or a single course in the other modes. There is another cup that allows you to play all of the courses at the same time in Grand Prix mode only and that's the All-Cup Tour.  For a big power boost at the start of the race, you must press "A" (which acts as the gas pedal) exactly when the screen says, "Start!". This can be done easily since the screen counts down from 3, 2, and then 1, at a steady pace. You should be able to get the timing right with practice if at first you don't get it. There is also the Double Dash starting boost and it works the same way as the rocket start, except that you and your teammate must press the gas pedal button at the same time.  Learn which can be used for you own benefit, or to slow down other racers. Here are some basic items to know:   Green Shells: Move in straight lines and will roll over a kart briefly. Can be thrown backwards or forwards. Red Shells: Home in automatically on the Kart in front of you and flip them over when it strikes if thrown forward. If thrown backwards it acts as a green shell traveling in straight lines only. Banana: Can be dropped for other karts to run over, causing them to spin out. Spiny Shell: These blue colored spiny shells fly above the track at ultra-fast speeds until it finds the leader and explodes them and anyone near them. Fake Item: These look like real item boxes from afar but shocks anyone who is foolish enough to touch them. Mushroom: Can be used to give your kart a short speed-boost. Star: Makes you invincible for a period of time and makes you faster. Karts that are touched by a star-kart will be sent flying. Thunderbolt: Shrinks everyone but the user in size and speed.  These fun extras can be fireballs, eggs, bombs, and others depending on your character!  , Also look out for Dash Panels. Your kart will go much faster when driving over one!  , This allows your car to "drift" or steer around without losing speed.  You're not going to win your first race unless you've had a lot of other Mario Kart experience, so the more you practice the better you get, just like with everything else.

 In a large bowl, sift together the flours, spices, sugar, salt, and yeast.In a different small bowl, whisk together the butter and hot water to melt the butter.  When the butter has melted, whisk in the milk.  Crack the egg into a small bowl and whisk it briefly. Add the egg, oil, and butter and milk to the dry ingredients.Use a wooden spoon to mix all the ingredients together. Continue mixing until the ingredients come together to form a smooth dough. If mixing with the spoon becomes difficult, knead the dough with your hands instead.  Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and place it somewhere warm to rise for one to two hours.It’s important to cover the dough so that it doesn’t dry out.  A good warm place for the dough to rise is an oven that’s turned off, but with the oven light turned on.  When the dough is ready, cover your hands with a layer of oil and turn the dough out onto a flat surface. Roll the dough out with your hands into a long cylinder that’s two inches (5 cm) thick.Cut the dough cylinder into smaller pieces that are one to two inches (2.5 to five cm) long. Arrange the dough pieces on two baking sheets and leave them to rise for another 30 to 40 minutes.  While the dough is rising for the second time, prepare the syrup. The doughnuts will be fried and then dunked into the syrup right away, so it needs to be ready for when the doughnuts are fried.  Combine the sugar, water, and spices in a medium saucepan. Bring it to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently to prevent the sugar from burning. When it comes to a boil, lower the heat and continue simmering and stirring until the syrup becomes thick.Lower the heat again and keep the syrup warm over low heat until the doughnuts are ready.  Fill a deep fryer or deep frying pan with oil and heat it over medium–high heat. Drop a pea-sized piece of dough into the oil. When it begins to cook and sizzle, you know the oil is ready.  Take a piece of dough and stretch it out slightly to get an oval shape. Repeat with every dough piece before frying.Drop a couple oval dough pieces into the oil, but don’t crowd them. Fry the dough until the koeksisters become golden brown, about one to two minutes.  Remove the doughnuts from the oil one at a time using a slotted spoon. Place them on a paper towel to remove some of the excess oil. Poke a few holes in each doughnut with a fork.Transfer the doughnuts to the warm syrup and roll them around to coat all sides.  When the doughnuts are drenched in syrup, remove them one at a time with the slotted spoon. Allow the excess syrup to drain off over the saucepan.  Roll each doughnut in the shredded coconut to coat them completely. Transfer them to a serving plate and enjoy! 

mix the dry and wet ingredients separately.  combine all the wet and dry ingredients.  leave the mixture to rise.  roll out the dough.  make the syrup.  stretch and fry the dough.  dip the doughnuts in the syrup.  roll in coconut before serving. 

 It should be a large soap, with a good firmness but not brittle. Old soap will likely break, so only use new soaps bought freshly from the store.   Any fragrance or color is fine. Get a few, as some may break when drilling.  Use a fine drill bit to drill straight down the center of the soap. Do this gently and slowly.  Tie a knot.   To help, tie the cord, ribbon, etc. onto a toothpick to pull through the soap.  Instant soap-on-a-rope without too much effort.  

choose a suitable soap that has already been made.  drill a hole down the center of the soap.  thread a ribbon, string or cord through the hole.  hang the soap in the shower. 

 If you are planning on living without electricity, then you are going to have to find other ways to power your home without the help of electricity companies. Renewable energy sources are an excellent way to do this. Install solar panels to harness the power of the sun, build wind turbines, or power your home through a hydropower system. You may also consider installing a generator so you can power your own electric items.Make a bicycle generator. Bike generators are both a great way to get exercise and a great way to charge your electronics. You can order the plans for bike generators online, or you can order pre made bike generators.       You should also consider using alternative fuels like biodiesel, biomass, and Ethanol.      ; , There are several viable options for how to best light your house. One of the best is the kerosene lantern. You could also use kerosene wick lamps, candles, and battery-charged camping lanterns. It’s also important to have flashlights on hand for when you need to get up in the middle of the night but don’t have any lights to turn on.If you decide to get a bicycle generator, you will be able to light your the lamps in your house.  This means adding extra insulation to your house’s walls, particularly in the attic and around doorways. Heat escapes under doorways, around windows and through the upper regions of the house. Create an insulation system that will let as little heat escape as possible. Buy door sweeps to block up the undersides of doors.   You should also consider using a window insulator kit to block air leaking through your windows. You can either purchase a ready made window insulation kit, or make your own.  If you do not have a fireplace or wood-burning stove, you should seriously consider building one, especially if you live in a cold climate. To heat other rooms in the house, you can consider building vents onto your fireplace that lead to the other rooms., One of the best ways to cook without using any electricity is to install a wood stove. When it gets too hot to cook over the wood stove, use propane or butane camping stoves (which act exactly like any other gas stove.)   If you have a gas stove, you can still use it without using electricity. You will just have to light the burners with matches or a lighter.  Rather than purchasing fruits and vegetables from a store, why not grow your own? With just a few seeds, you can turn your yard into a cornucopia of produce. Growing your crops on your own land will also mean that you have control over what sort of contaminants your food is exposed to.   Plant crops that will produce fruits and vegetables at different times of the year, that way you have delicious food to eat all year round.       If you are really serious about growing a lot of crops, you will need to learn about crop rotation. To read more about farming crops in large quantities and crop rotation, click here.        Plant an herb garden so that you can have fresh and delicious herbs. Dry some of the herbs so that you can use them year round.  If you have the space to do so, you should consider raising livestock. Cows, goats, and sheep are all excellent dairy sources, chickens provide eggs and meat, and pigs can help you compost as well as provide you with food. You can sell, trade, or keep what your livestock produces.Build a chicken coop to house your chickens. Your chicken coop should have room for your chickens to wander around in, as well as some cubby holes where they can lay their eggs.  A large part of living without electricity is being able to preserve food, even when you don’t have a refrigerator to store it in. Nearly everything can be canned--from fruits and vegetables, to meat and eggs, canning is an excellent way to preserve your fresh produce. If you plan on doing a lot of canning, you should consider purchasing a pressure canner. Pressure canners make the canning process a lot more efficient.    Pickle other foods that you want to preserve. Pickled food can be great during the winter when fresh food is less available.        Dry fruits, vegetables and meat. Drying food is also an excellent way to store food without using electricity.  Compost is incredibly handy, particularly when you do not want to pay for city trash services. Not only will a compost pile help you achieve nutrient rich fertilizer, it is also relatively easy to build.  It is particularly easy to do this if you raise livestock. Your garden will be particularly grateful to you if you feed it with your own homemade organic fertilizer.  Consider your skills--are you good at sewing, cooking, carving, building, etc.? Determine what supplies you might need to make things in bulk. Also consider what products you can make from what you already have. Are you raising sheep? Then learn how to knit or make cheese out of your sheep's milk.  While this may seem like a daunting task, it becomes easy with practice. Scrub your clothes against a washboard, rinse them, and then hang them out to dry.   The secret to soft clothing is to rinse your clothes with one or two cups of vinegar before hanging them to dry. The vinegar will keep your clothes from getting too stiff while they air dry.  

invest in alternative energy.  plan out your lighting system.  winterize your house.  consider central heating.  figure out how you’re going to cook.  plant a garden.  raise livestock.  learn how to preserve food.  create a compost pile.  make your own fertilizer.  focus on a product that you can create to sell or trade.  hand wash your clothes. 

 Your close friends should really like you, and you should all have some similar things in common. You should be the center of attention in your group, but don't make them hate you. They should be loyal, smart, cool, and funny or outgoing nice people. Your official group should consist of 2-6 people. At least one or two should be the type to do whatever you want done for you. Buy them presents every now and then, invite them to parties or to do fun stuff like sleepovers or movies, and always spend time with them. Don't hang out with everyone in your class a little here, and a little there. You stick to them. A lot of boys talk about girls, so if your group seems like the type, go ahead! If your friends like hockey, and you do too, go ahead and play the game. On the weekends or during summer break, you could take them to a water park or an amusement park and go on the best rides. Make sure you wear all the best clothes, and always try to be the "best-dressed" in your group. Saying that you can't afford that stuff is not an excuse. If you think people are straying, or less loyal to you (friends or acquaintances or whatever) then get a secret from them - never do anything nasty with it, that's really low, don't even threaten to, they'll just assume and understand and be nicer - or at the very least, if they do stray, won't turn on you.   Remember - you want true friends, not idol worshipers (if your less close friends and classmates worship and idolize you, though, that would be a good thing).; , Looking good is one of the main things of being a popular boy. Wash your hair every day, and use deodorant if needed, smell good, and wash your face every morning.   You should also have mint flavored gum handy for fresh smelling breath. Use mouthwash in the mornings. Bring deodorant in your backpack too as an extra just in case.  Focus on your hair, be conceited if you have to. Take note of the hairstyles that cool and popular kids have. Don't have it too long, or you'll look like a girl. You can have it somewhat long, but mostly just keep it normal.  Don't pass the mean thing. If you don't do it completely, you've got to do it a little bit. Don't treat your friends like losers. Losers you have to treat like losers. Your friends, you treat like your friends. Be nice to girls. Girls you like you should just compliment them every now and then and be really nice to them. Unless they're your sister! Wink wink.  You should always have the perfect thing to say to anyone who insults you, right away. Make sure what you say is quick, witty, and makes total sense. Here's a tip: you have to hit the opponent where it hurts the most. Find out what makes them squirm,and use that in a comeback. Don't let anyone get away with insulting you. Being quick witted and smart is always respected. If for some reason you can't think of a good comeback on the spot, stare your opponent down. Give a tiny eye roll, smirk, and look them up and down. This would make them feel insecure without you doing anything. Then you would have won the battle.   If someone does something to threaten your spot, put them in their place and be a b*tch. Say something to them that wouldn't make them go near you ever again, but still want to be you.  People love mysterious, and secretive people. Make sure you have at least one person you can trust, which most likely would be your best friend. Tell secrets with your friends, and keep them between your friends and you.  Don't buy dorky, mommy's boy, or extremely cheap clothes. If you want to be the center of attention, you should always go with a better brand but definitely not a fancy restaurant look. If you can't afford that, look for sales at some of the best brands, usually at the end of summer, there is a huge online sale at most stores! You can also go to cheaper brands that look more expensive, not everything has to be $100. Just don't have a trashy, cheap look. T-shirts from GAP are usually fine. Don't wear pink under any circumstances. Don't wear polos too often. Some ideas for clothing brands are "Abercrombie", "Hollister", "Aeropostale", "Desigual", and "Nike". Don't always wear brand clothing, wear a variety of clothing. Just again, no dorky stuff. Saying that you can't afford it is not an excuse.   Flip-flops are great for summer days. Avoid most sandals unless your feet are nice enough to show off.  You should get at least an hour and a half of physical activity each day. Also, don't consume too much junk food or too many carbs. Join Sports teams, play the basketball game that everyone's doing at recess. It's a tough world out there, and nobody likes an obese or unhealthy kid. Try to lose weight before conquering your school if you're a little overweight, and you'll be fine. Don't be overly skinny.  No one really has confidence. You just have to project it and make people think you do. Overtime you will be more confident but don't be afraid to be outgoing. Especially when you're putting someone in their place, you have to be confident.   If you feel very unconfident about yourself, type up 100, no more, no less reasons you rock.  Don't play it dumb, or fake. Even though you're using these tips to become the ruler of your school, don't completely change who you are. You have to be yourself or people might avoid you. If the person you're trying to be friends with doesn't want to be friends with you, then it's their loss, not yours. Don't let somebody change you. If he/she doesn't like you for who you are, then move on to a different person. Be fake nice to people who you don't like, but make it obvious.  Please don't go on about "studying makes you nerdy" because it's not true. Popularity in school doesn't last you forever. You'll need to be smart after school when you get a job. You don't have to show it that much, just be sure that you don't flunk everything.  Spread a few rumors, but be witty with this and never let anyone trace it back to you. If they do trace it back to you, don't deny it. Smirk and say "I know, so what?" and walk away. People will think you're untouchable and perfect. Pull pranks on people, and always make sure someone in your clique, if it's not you, is always good at getting the latest scoop and gossip about everyone, so you have something to keep under lock and key until you need it. Wink wink again.  If someone has fun even though it may be against the "school rules", don't tell on them. That will make everyone hate you. You don't go by the rules too much, but don't overdo not following them to the extent of expulsion. Unless you have enough schemes up your sleeve to be un-expelled, but you're not Blair Waldorf, so bottom line - don't get expelled. If you can get your teachers to love you, great, take advantage of that fact. Just don't start worshiping your teacher -- that would be awkward.   Don't be rude to teacher's faces, but don't be overly helpful and nice either. Feel free to gossip about teachers that you hate though. Everyone does it.  When you're trying to get something with an adult, or if you're talking to the principal, hide yourself a little, and be sweet, even if you hate your principal to the bone. You'll almost never get in trouble doing it this way.  People are probably going to insult you a few times, but they're mostly either envying you or they're too much of a goody two shoes. If someone says "You're ugly" or "I hate you" or "You're mean" or something like that, use one of your instant super witty comebacks that we discussed at the top of this page. People are going to envy you, or hate you because you're way more popular than them. Don't cry when someone says something bad about you, that's just downright dumb. Give a comeback that makes them squirm, and be a bitch about it to them. They'll be scared to pick a fight with you, and your clique is the backup.  It can be useful, believe me. If someone does something to piss you off, don't let it slide or try to suck up to them to make them like you. Get revenge when you need to, they won't stand a chance.   Scheme with your group when you can.  People may think you're self centered, but if you're the ruler, that's sorta got to happen.  

have a group of friends, or a "clique".  be approachable.  make sure your hair looks good at all times, and you have a good hairstyle.  have great comebacks.  be secretive.  clothing.  exercise and be healthy.  look confident at all times.  be yourself.  study.  gossip.  don't be a goody-two shoes.  be sweet when you need to.  let things slide of your back.  always know how to get your revenge.  love being you. 

 Sleep deprivation affects everything from driving to decision-making and response time. When someone is sleep deprived, she is as functionally impaired as someone with a blood alcohol content of .08%, which is legally intoxicated in most states.Consequences of not getting enough rest are far more than feeling sleepy. Insufficient sleep leads to difficulties with concentration, being unmotivated to take care of responsibilities. Lack of sleep leads to more acne and pimples. You may become more aggressive or irritable, getting into trouble with your peers and friends. Many teens overeat when they don't get enough rest, or eat too many unhealthy foods when they're tired. Not getting enough sleep can contribute to obesity and other health problems.  Sleeplessness is connected to clinical depression, suicidal ideation, and other mood disorders.Research shows that there is a strong association between negative mood and sleep problems in children ages 11-17.   Among teenagers who report being unhappy, 73% report insufficient sleep at night.Many signs of sleeplessness are identical to signs of depression, including sleepiness during the day, poor concentration, forgetfulness, loss of energy, listlessness, and changes in weight and appetite.  Insomnia is both a symptom and a cause of depression in teens. If you have tried to get more rest on your own and you're still unable to sleep, consult a medical provider for help. Symptoms of depression often are hidden by typical teenage behavior or sleep disturbances. Understanding the reason for your sleeplessness may provide better ways to address it.Anxiety and depression tend to affect more teenage girls than boys. Behaviors associated with depression may be more likely to be disregarded in girls. For teenagers, some form of cognitive behavioral treatment may be indicated.

 Studies have shown that organic milk is much healthier than regular milk. Some benefits of organic milk is the fact that organic milk is from cows that haven't been given growth hormones, it is wholesome, produced without harmful pesticides, etc.   Organic milk isn't produced with antibiotics. Overuse of antibiotics is a serious health problem. Today, of all the main places that antibiotics is overused is in agriculture. Organic milk comes from cows that were not given antibiotics, so it doesn't contribute to the growing problem of bacterial resistance. Organic milk is very high in conjugated linoleic acids (CLA). CLAs are important healthy fats that has been proven to have been linked to reduced heart disease and diabetes. As a matter of fact, in the May 9th issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine, researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard School of Public Health reported that dairy products that are low in fat, including milk, is shown to lower the risk of type 2 diabetes (in men). Another big advantage of organic milk over regular milk is its ability to go for a long time without turning sour: organic milk is heated to around 280 °F (138 °C), so it would take up to two months for it to turn sour. Because of the fact that regular, pasteurized milk is heated to 145 °F (63 °C), it doesn't have the same life. So if you are worried about milk turning sour fairly quickly, then organic milk may actually allow you to save money. Understand that it's the right thing to do. Organic cows must be able to access open air, unlike factory cows. Cows that produce organic milk, or organic cows from many dairy farms are allowed to graze freely in organic pasture. This type of farming is considerate to animals, and isn't cruel, is very supportive of wildlife, good for many rural communities, respectful of air, water and soil, and is healthy for people.; , Rather than putting milk in your tea, try putting in honey instead. Also, try to put milk inside coffee rather than tea, as milk doesn't affect coffee.   Protein: A good source of energy: builds and repairs your muscle tissue; good after work-outs.  Potassium: Helps you keep a good blood pressure.  Phosphorus: Helps strengthen your bones and gives you energy.  Vitamin D: Helps your body maintain your bones.  Vitamin B12: Helps maintain healthy red blood cells and helps maintain nerve tissue.  Vitamin A: Helps maintain the immune system; helps maintain normal vision and good skin.  Niacin: Improves your metabolism; have a glass before doing aerobics. , The USDA has shown drinking milk to prevent osteoporosis, because of its nutrients: calcium and vitamin D. Other evidence shows the intake of milk and milk products is linked to improved bone health and the reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes. , Pasteurization kills bacteria and other harmful microorganisms that are found in raw milk, and it is dangerous to drink raw milk.   Be sure to read the label. Safe milk, meaning pasteurized milk, will have the word "pasteurized" on the label. If the word "pasteurized" is not found on the label of a product, it may contain raw milk. Do not be afraid to ask your grocer or store clerk whether milk or dairy products have been pasteurized, especially milk or milk products sold in refrigerated cases. Do not buy milk or milk products at farm stands or farmers' markets unless you can confirm that it has been pasteurized. , Heartburn is caused a lot of the time by acidity, so logically milk naturally relieves heartburn.  For thousands of years, milk has been known to keep skin clear. The lactic acid found in milk aids in removing dead skin cells, and therefore keeps your skin clear and rejuvenated., Milk has been shown to protect the enamel against acidic foods. Also, the calcium and vitamin D found in milk keeps bones strong, although teeth are not considered bones. , Many dieters do not consume dairy, because they think that milk will not help them lose weight. Recent studies performed by the Ben-Gurion University has shown that including more calcium in your diet may lead to continuous weight-loss. Drinking 12 ounces (580 g) of milk every day assists the loss of more than 12 lbs on average, while people who only consume a cup of milk a day lose on average 7 lbs.  

buy organic milk.  be aware that if you are trying to drink more milk by putting milk inside your tea, the benefits of the tea will be cancelled entirely.  be aware of all the vitamins and minerals found in milk:  calcium: keeps bones and teeth healthy; helps your body maintain bone mass.  drink milk to avoid illnesses.  be aware as to whether or not milk or milk products are made out of pasteurized milk or not.  drink milk to help reduce acidity.  drink milk to have clear skin.  drink milk for healthy teeth.  drink milk to lose weight. 

 Say ‘walk on’.  Put gently pressure on the lead rope and walk forward.  When he learns that ‘walk on’ means you about to ask him to step forward, he will step forward sooner. Give him lots of praise when he does this. Eventually he will step forward when you just say ‘walk on’.  Give the new command (leg) and then the old command (walk on).  

give the new command clearly.  give the old command.  watch the horse carefully.  transfer this early training to the saddle. 

 Young girls can be just as obsessed with their looks as tweens and teens.Remind young girls that it is good to try to look your best, but your personality, and the way you treat people matter a lot more.   Complement them on their skills and abilities as much as you do their looks. For example, you might say, “You look very nice in that outfit, Angeletta. The yellow matches your friendly personality.” Allow them to express their personal style and take pride in their appearance. For example, if you are a parent, let them pick out their own clothes and hairstyle every once and a while.  Even at a young age, the media and peer pressure can influence how girls feel about themselves. You can build confidence in young girls by remind them that they are great just the way they are.   You might say, “No matter what anyone might say, always remember that you’re wonderful just the way you are.” Or, you could try, “Don’t ever feel the need to do something just to seem cool or to be popular. You are cool just being you.” Remind them that it’s okay to be different. You could say, “Everyone is different in some way and that’s what makes the world a wonderful place.”  , Young girls can develop eating disorders because of a negative self-image. In turn, the eating disorder may reinforce their negative feelings about their appearance. You can build confidence in young girls by teaching them about being healthy.   Talk to them about selecting healthy snacks when they have the chance, like fresh fruits and vegetables. Remind them to drink water instead of drinks that are high in sugar or caffeine. For example, you could say, “Water is good for your body and is healthier than a soda.” Explain that getting enough sleep will help them feel happier and look more energized. You might tell them, “You think better and feel better about yourself when you have enough rest.”  

help keep looks in perspective.  tell them to always be themselves.  teach them about healthy living. 

 YouTube is the largest and most popular video streaming site by far. It's also a good place to listen to popular music, including current hits.   YouTube is also rife with homemade shows and series of all kinds. These usually have low production value but can be quite entertaining and informative. Movies and mainstream TV shows can be found on YouTube, but more popular and well-known properties usually get taken off the site for copyright reasons. There are, however, a whole lot of movies in the public domain (not under copyright anymore).; , Hulu is a mainstream video site like YouTube that bridges the gap between free content and professional content. It features a rotating menu of films and TV shows for free, plus a more expansive monthly pay service.   Hulu tends to have a lot of free TV shows, but very few A-list shows. There's usually a mix of older and newer shows available. Hulu's free film selection is fairly small, but it's easy to search. Again, expect a mix of old and new titles.  This site is a direct competitor to YouTube. As with YouTube, all of Vimeo's content is free, but users can pay a fee to upgrade to higher-quality streaming and more space to upload their own videos.   Vimeo features independent, professional-quality work, such as artistic short films, as a point of pride. It also features plenty of ordinary user-created content. TV shows and wide-release movies are rare on Vimeo, but obscure and small-budget projects abound.  

start with youtube.  check out hulu.com.  spend some time at vimeo.com. 

 How far you fold it depends on your preference. Nonetheless, it should be folded approximately in half lengthwise.If you use a twin or a full sheet, you don't need to fold the toga.         If you fold it exactly in half, you will make a very short toga.For a longer toga, don't go all the way down when folding it. Just fold it partway.Remember, togas were generally worn over tunics, so you can wear it over a shirt or some other type of garment or even your regular clothes. Using a sheet, in particular, creates a fairly skimpy toga, so you probably want to wear something under it.  You can drape the whole edge over the left arm. This end will hang down in front.Another option is just draping the the top corner over so it forms a point.         If you're draping the toga yourself, the easiest way to do this step is to throw the whole sheet over your shoulders like a cape, lengthwise. On your left side, pull it so just the end is hanging over your arm, then pull up the slack on the other side., Now that you've got it draped on the left side, pull it under your right arm.You can leave it over your right arm, as the Romans sometimes wore togas almost like a sling, but you'll have more movement if you pull it under.         Try to gently pleat the part that goes under your arm. That is, when it comes around your hip from the back, use your hands to fold the fabric back and forth, so it drapes in small folds., Finally, take the end and push it over your left shoulder. Try to get as much of it over your shoulder, while still pulling the right side down over your hip somewhat.         Though the Romans didn't usually pin their togas, you can use a safety pin to pin it at the shoulder. That way, it won't slip off. 

fold the sheet.  drape one end over the left arm.  pull it under your right arm.  throw the rest over your shoulder. 

 Wear gloves to speed up the process and avoid hurting your hands. Test the temperature of the bit against your cheek, since your hands are a poor judge of temperature. This usually takes several minutes.  If your bit is removable, this is a quick way to warm it up. Keep it there while you ready the rest of the tack.   If the bit won’t fit in your pocket, hold it under one arm while you groom the horse with your free hand.  If you’re lucky enough to have sunshine, hang the bridle in full sun as soon as you get to the stall.  

rub it between your hands.  stick the bit in your jacket pocket.  hang in the sun. 

 Tickling sets off involuntary muscle responses in our bodies, meaning that we can’t control our reaction in laughing, smiling, or shrieking.Most people are ticklish in some way, then, whether all over or just in a small “tickle spot.” You won’t have to look far to find a target.   Choose someone you know, as most strangers will not take kindly to a random tickle. Even if you know the target, be sure that he’s comfortable with being touched. Target someone like a close friend, sibling, or cousin.; , Some people love to be tickled, while for others the experience is very unpleasant. We laugh during tickling because it is an automatic reaction, not because we necessarily like it or because it is enjoyable. Non-consensual tickling has even been used as a form of torture in the past.Be sure that the target will have fun with your surprise attack, or else you may cause him physical or emotional distress. Some people have a deep dislike for tickling. Have you tickled your target before? Did he just laugh, for example? Or did he fight back, ask you to stop, or try to run? You may want to hold back in the latter case.  Some places on the human body are more prone to ticklishness than others, like the soles of the feet, the toes, and the armpits. For your tickling reference, know these spots and target them.   Other high-priority tickle areas include the belly, the sides (around the ribcage), the backs of the knees, the back of the neck, and the ears. Your victim may be more susceptible to tickling in one or more of these areas than in others. Experiment. Find out where he is most vulnerable.  Another way to heighten the experience is to vary the kind of touch you use when tickling. Mix it up. Sometimes a light stroke is best, while at others you should really aim for a full on hard tickle.   For example, try sneaking up on your target and lightly touching the back of his neck with the tips of your fingernails. This sort of touch is the kind that sends shivers up the spine. A lot of females have long nails. This can be a big advantage for you when tickling someone by spider tickling (lightly running all your fingers) or stroking. To get a bigger response and more laughter, take both hands and really go for the person’s vulnerable spot. Mix up speed, as well. Tickle fast at times, and at others tickle slow.  

set your sights on a target.  read your victim’s cues.  focus on tickle spots.  use different forms of touch. 

,, Enable it.    Note that using the "No Auto-Restart" feature does not achieve the goal that you want. It will stop the auto-restart but you will continue to get pop-ups asking for a restart until you do. To prevent this, you need to enable "Re-prompt for restart with scheduled installations", found in the same section, and set the interval for reprompts to the max allowed which is 1440. That's 24 hours. You will probably turn off or restart your computer normally during that time. With this option set, you will be asked only once to restart now or later. After you click later, you will not be asked again until the next day if you have left your PC on for 24 hours.        

enter gpedit.msc into the start > run dialog.  ,  navigate to computer configuration > administrative template > windows components > windows update.  ,  right click on no auto-restart for scheduled automatic updates installations.  exit the group policy editor and reboot. 

 If you want to get a good fold, you must make sure the paper is even, doesn't have any cuts, wrinkles, or wet spots.    ; ,, Lift the other edge of the piece of paper about one inch off of the folding surface. (Be careful not to rip it.) Carefully pull that corner over to the opposite side of the paper. Make sure the corners line up. You will notice that if you let go of the corner at this point the paper will go back to normal.  Carefully apply downward force onto the bend by sliding your finger down the bend, and be sure not to rip the paper with your fingernail. Ensure a good crease by going over the fold with the back of your fingernail (still being careful not to rip it). If you have done this correctly, your paper should be symmetrical, and it should seem half the size of the original unbent paper.  You've folded a piece of paper!      

find a flat surface for optimum fold quality.  lay the piece of paper in front of you on the surface carefully.  ,  hold one edge of the paper onto the folding surface firmly, but without damaging it.  to press down on the folded side of the paper, bring your finger to the top of the bend in the paper.  good job! 

 Prepare the lamington pan by lining it with baking (parchment) paper, and approximately 5cm (2") over the top edges.; , Beat them using an electric mixer for 10 minutes. It will take longer by hand, the end result should be thick and creamy. As you're beating the eggs, gradually fold in the sugar so that it dissolves after each addition.  You should now have a smooth lamington batter.  Use a spatula to spread out an even surface across the top.    Bake for 35 minutes or until a skewer or toothpick inserted comes out clean.    Place on a wire cooling rack to cool down.  Mix the ingredients together in a heatproof icing bowl over the double boiler (bain marie) until even and lump-free. It must be a consistency thick enough to coat the cake pieces.  Dip each square on all sides in the icing. Allow any excess icing to drain off over the icing bowl.    Use tongs to hold the cake if you don't want to get your fingers coated in icing. , This will take anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour, depending on humidity. 

preheat the oven to 180ºc (350ºf) or 160ºc fan-forced.  crack the eggs into a mixing bowl.  fold in the sifted flours.  pour the lamington batter evenly across the lamington pan.  place the lamington pan into the oven (wear oven mitts).  remove the pan from the oven.  prepare the icing (frosting) while the lamington cake is cooling.  cut the cooled cake length into 16 even pieces.  gently roll the coated lamington square in the coconut bowl to cover the lamington.  ,  return each lamington to the wire cooling rack to set.  finished.  

 While not necessary to succeed in Hollywood (directors like Steven Spielberg, Quentin Tarantino and James Cameron never went to film school), film school is a great place to learn the hard skills of film -- camera settings, lenses, lighting, and sound design -- while getting a chance to practice with professional equipment.   Many cities have night classes in film at local art schools if you have already graduated.; , Filming is an incredibly involved process that often takes over 100 people to get right. From make-up and costuming to sound engineering and cinematography, there are a lot of potential jobs in Hollywood behind the scenes. However, almost none of them will hire you without past experience. In almost every instance you have to start from the bottom to get the job you want. Some of the most common entry level positions are:   ’’’Production Assistant (PA):’’’ The PA does whatever the movie needs, from picking up actors or food to checking the script and rolling up cords. This is oftentimes the first job a burgeoning filmmaker takes, because they get to work with many different film departments and meet many people, but it is thankless work.’’’Grip:’’’ Holds boom microphones and sometimes cameras. This is a great job for someone interested in the audio side of Hollywood, but it is physically taxing to hold up equipment all day. ’’’Script Supervisor:’’’ Reads the script while filming to make sure there are no mistakes. Though this is not always considered an entry level position, smaller studios will often hire a new person if they have experience in editing or writing., Internships are not just for college students and recent graduates – anyone can find a good internship with a little hard work. And though the job is often thankless, being in a studio each day teaches you about the industry and open doors to better jobs later in life.Most major studios, like Lionsgate, Universal, NBC, and FX offer yearly internship programs on their websites. If you love the movies or TV a certain studio produces, check out “Employment” or “Jobs” on their website. Search Craiglist, InternMatch.com, and EntertainmentJobs.com for internships across Hollywood.  Being a production assistant or intern is not easy. Most of your day is spent doing menial tasks or running errands, and it might feel like you are wasting your time. However, almost every single person working in Hollywood started from the bottom and worked their way up because they were dependable, respectful, and helpful.   You must prove your can do the basic jobs on a film set before you are trusted with the creative jobs.  The best way to get experience is to take matters into your own hands. These days, the equipment needed to make a film is almost astonishingly cheap, as most smart phones can record HD video and sound right out of the box. Grab some friends, write a short script, and start filming today.   Post your videos on Youtube, Vimeo, and Reddit to grab viewers online. Submit your movie to film festivals, like Austin Film Fest or Sundance, where film professionals might see it and ask for more work. This is how several famous writers/directors, like the Duplass brothers (Jeff Who Lives at Home, The League,) got started., While a good smile and personality will help in an interview, most studios want to see some of your work before hiring you. A demo reel is a short compilation of your film accomplishments that you use to prove your skills. It should be no more than 2 minutes long and it should feature your very best work.   Keep it short – you should grab their interest in the first 30 seconds. Tailor your reel to your job – if you are applying for a job editing, focus on scenes that cut between multiple angles, if you are focusing on sound design then focus on scenes that showcase how you mix music, dialogue, and sound effects seamlessly. Try to show a variety of work – if you can show 2-4 different projects successfully you prove that you can work on a variety of films., Hollywood is a tight-knit community, and you never know when someone will offer you your big break. Working lots of different gigs, going to parties, and introducing yourself often will create a network of people around you that can lead to your next job.   Work as many gigs as you can to gain experience and make new contacts. Always be respectful and helpful on set – you never know who might get a promotion and need your help later in life.  

get a degree in film or film production.  start with an entry-level position, like production assistant or grip.  get an internship with a film studio.  do every single job to the best of your ability, no matter the task.  make films in your free time.  put together a “demo reel” to send to potential employers.  meet as many people as possible. 

 Place the litter box inside a large storage bench or dresser. You can use wood, plastic, or wicker. Cut holes in both ends of the bench or dresser so your cat can easily get in and out.  The storage bench or dresser should be large enough to easily hold the litter box and give your cat enough space to move around in.  Try placing the litter box inside a cabinet. You can cut an opening in the existing cabinet so you can still open the doors to get to the litter box. Or install a sliding ledge in the bottom of the cabinet. This will let you pull the litter box out when you need to clean it.If you'd like to give your cat the easiest access to the cabinet, consider leaving the bottom of the cabinet open. Just hang a curtain from the top of the cabinet, so it covers the litter box.  If you'd like to hide the litter box while dividing the room into a space for your cat, set up a large screen in front of the litter box. Or if you'd like something to just hide the litter box, buy a small tri-fold screen that you can put right next to the box.Consider using a Japanese shoji screen if you want a large screen. You can find a design that will work with your space while hiding the litter box area.  There are dozens of “kitty litter box houses” available online and in pet stores. Many of them also serve as a functional piece of furniture, such as a bench or a wash basin cabinet. Or build a simple one by making a rectangular box with an opening. You can then lower the box over the litter box and simply lift it out of the way when you change or clean the litter.  Once you've decided where to place the litter box, surround it with large and bushy potted houseplants. These can make the area seem fresh and disguise the litter box. Just ensure that none of the plants are toxic to cats (like charming dieffenbachia, jade, lillies, coleus, and ivy).You can even buy large potted plants that have a hidden litter box in the base of the pot. There's an opening for your cat to get in and use the box.  

install the box in a storage bench or dresser.  modify a cabinet.  place a screen in front of the litter box.  buy or build your own litter box disguise.  surround your litter box with houseplants. 

 India’s economy is growing, and the demand for English teachers is growing with it. There are ESL positions available to foreign nationals in nonprofits, primary schools, language schools, international schools, and companies. The advantage of finding a position through an established program is that they’ll help arrange visas, housing, travel, and other logistics for you.Be sure to read reviews of programs so that you can make an informed decision about whether or not they’re right for you and so that you don’t have any unpleasant surprises. If no reviews are available online, ask the program for contact information for current or past participants. If you’d like to stay in India, remember that you can always find another ESL gig while you’re completing your first temporary assignment through a program.  India’s a big country. You may want to search for programs in a specific city or region based on its culture, geography, and/or climate. At the very least, you should decide whether you’d prefer a rural or urban teaching situation.Nearly 70% of Indians still live in rural villages, where the need for education is greatest. In general, rural communities have less developed infrastructures for transportation, communication, utilities, and sanitation. Therefore, the overall standards of living are lower. Literacy rates tend to be lower and poverty rates higher in rural locales. You should also look into the accommodations offered by each program. Check to see if room and board are included and what sorts of living conditions you can expect.  Each program will have a different duration, ranging from weeks to a year or more. Figuring out how long you’d like to commit to ESL teaching in India can help you select an appropriate program.   If you have a finite amount of time or are worried about whether or not you’ll like it, go for a short-term program. You can also sign on for another program once you’ve given it a trial run.  Would you like to teach kids or adults, students or professionals? Think about which age groups and experience levels that you would like to be instructing.   Remember, if you would like to teach at higher levels or in more professional contexts, it’s likely that you’ll need specific credentials first. Be sure to check if your program has any prerequisites in terms of education or certifications. Also, look into the teaching resources and support offered by each program.  Most teach abroad programs in India are voluntary. If you’re looking for a short-term, enriching experience, then doing a volunteer teaching program might be right for you. If you’re looking for a longer term assignment that will provide you with a basic income, focus on paid opportunities.Popular volunteer programs include Teaching Volunteer Project India, Global Citizen Year, Semester Abroad, WorldTeach India, and Asian College of Teachers. If you’d like to find a paid position, you can find current listings at job sites like Craigslist India, Monster India, or Dave ESL Cafe.Because English is an official language in India, most paid ESL positions do not come with large salaries. The average pay is 10,000-15,000 rupees per month plus accommodation. This is enough to live off of comfortably and go on occasional holidays., At a minimum, most ESL teaching positions and programs require a Bachelor’s Degree in any subject from an accredited university and a valid passport. You may also need to get a teaching certification and/or a visa. Be sure that you can fulfill the basic qualifications before you apply.ESL teaching certifications are generally short, post-baccalaureate programs. They are available in most countries and online and qualify you to teach English as a foreign language around the world.  Not all programs require you to take a qualifying Teaching-English-to-Speakers-of-Other-Languages course and exam. However, doing so will make you a more attractive applicant and qualify you for a wider range of teaching gigs.Most countries have TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages), TESL (Teaching English as a Second Language), and/or TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) programs available. You can take courses online or in-person in as little as four weeks.Many teach abroad programs in India offer TESOL/TEFL courses and certification as part of the program. Go Overseas has a database of reviews for qualifying courses to teach abroad: https://www.gooverseas.com/tefl-courses  Companies and language schools often require or strongly prefer certified teachers.  

research teach abroad programs.  take location into consideration.  decide on a timeline.  pick a teaching level.  decide if you’re looking for a volunteer or paid gig.  determine your eligibility.  consider getting a tesol certification. 

, For shots with action, hold the shot for at least 10 seconds. , If someone is cooking, get a close-up of their hands or the ingredients. If you are in a taxi, get a close-up of the driver or the rear-view mirror.  Just try to get the camera as close as possible for your shot. When shooting from far away, zoom in and focus your shot before you push the record button.  Sometimes shoot from down low, up high, or off to the side.  Interviewing local people will help you capture the culture of your travel destination. Adding local interviews to your video will also help break up you narration and keep your audience interested.  

use a tripod or rest your hand on something to hold your hand steady.  ,  hold each shot for a minimum of 5 seconds without moving the camera.  get two or three wide, establishing shots of your location.  ,  take plenty of close-ups to show details.  do not zoom in while the camera is recording.  vary your angles.  talk to people. 

 Position your free hand a short distance away from the other hand. Since he will be jumping, you want to prevent any potential injuries. If your gecko does fall, check him over for injuries such as bruising or broken limbs. If your gecko is not walking normally after a fall, take him to see a vet.   Do not be alarmed if his tail falls off. This is normal in crested geckos. Tail loss is a natural response to stress or fear. In the wild, they lose their tails to get away from predators. Your gecko will be fine after dropping his tail, although it will not grow back. There may be a stump left afterwards., Make sure your free hand is slightly higher with a short distance between them. You will know if your gecko will jump because of his body language. His toes will move in front of his head as his body pushes back and up. His eyes will also be locked on the other hand as he aims for it. , Your gecko may not be comfortable with jumping between hands at first. As you handle him, you can give him room to jump, and over time, he will become more comfortable with your handling. He may also jump straight over your hand. Catch him if he does, and place him back on your arm.  

hold your gecko close to the ground with one hand.  wait for him to jump.  practice. 

 A clicker is a small noise-making device which emits a sharp cracking sound when squeezed. These are available at your local pet store or online. When your dog performs a positive action, you should squeeze the clicker, then immediately administer a dog treat and/or fulsome praise.It’s alright if teaching your dog to play shy is the first trick it will learn with the clicker. However, if he or she has been trained with the clicker before in more basic tricks such as sit, play dead, or lie down, your dog will learn to play shy through clicker training much faster.  A target, in dog training, is the place or position you want the dog to be in. Targets will evolve in difficulty for the dog as the training process proceeds. A starting target for training a dog to play shy could be a a ruler or short stick.   Lay the stick on the floor about 10 centimeters in front of the dog. Beckon the dog forward with a treat. When the dog sets his or her paw on the stick, squeeze your clicker and administer the treat. Repeat seven to ten times, alternately administering either a dog treat, or praise (“Good boy/girl!”)  , Instead of clicking and rewarding your dog when it steps on the stick, life the stick with your hand about halfway up the dog’s body. Hold it close enough that the dog does not need to move forward to touch the target, but can simply reach its paw out to make contact with it.   If your dog is 30 centimeters tall, hold the ruler or stick in front of him or her at a height of approximately 15 centimeters. When your dog places its paw on the target, squeeze the clicker and administer either a dog treat or generous verbal praise. Your dog should recognize that stepping on the target stick is still the goal even though it has changed position. However, you may need to demonstrate to your dog how to step on the stick. Take its paw in your hand and place it on the stick directly one or two times, then click your clicker and administer a treat when after it has held the position for two or three seconds.  Bring the target stick further up the dog’s body. If your dog is 30 centimeters tall and you moved the stick from the ground to a point 15 centimeters up, after seven to ten successful attempts by the dog to place its paw on the stick, move it up to 17 centimeters. Just as before, each time the dog places its paw on the target, squeeze your clicker and administer a treat to the dog. Seven to ten successful attempts later, raise the target up to 19 or 20 centimeters.   As you elevate the target, shorten it as well. Instead of a ruler or stick, use a straw. After each elevation cut it a bit shorter.  As you elevate and shorten the target, bring it closer to your dog’s snout, aiming for an area just below its eyes. Once you bring the target object close enough to make contact with the dog’s snout, deploy your cue phrase (“Play shy” or some variation) just before you raise it to the point near your dog's eye. Your dog should, in the final stage, be raising his or her paw to a point where he or she covers or touches this point near the eye. Repeat seven to ten times.  When the dog learns to associate your command to play shy with its action and subsequent reward, you have properly conditioned it. Once conditioned, you can take away the target and practice playing shy with only the clicker and dog treats. After a week or so, begin to phase out the clicker as well. Use it every three out of four times instead of every time, then every one of two times after another week or so.   If the dog cannot perform the trick without the target object or clicker, you may need to go back to an earlier stage of training to reinforce the steps you taught your dog initially. Keep practicing until the dog understands how to play shy.  

obtain a clicker and use it to train your dog.  set a target for your dog’s movement.  move the target.  continue elevating the target.  bring the target closer to the dog’s snout.  condition your dog to play shy. 

 Are you just looking for a slight change to revitalize your look or are you interested in making a dramatic change? Make sure that you consider rules at your place of work or school as you plan your new hair color look.; , Cut pictures out of magazines or save images onto your phone or computer so that you can easily look through the hair color looks that you like. Saving these pictures will also provide your hair stylist with a guide if you decide to have your hair professionally colored.  If you are considering a haircut in addition to your new hair color, you should get your hair cut first. If you cut your hair first, you will save money because you will need less dye to color your hair. Cutting before coloring will also allow you to see the effects of your new hair color on your new haircut.  If you make a dramatic change, like going from blond to black, then you will need to have regular touch-ups to maintain that look. But if you only make a subtle change, like going only one shade darker than your natural color, you will not need to worry about maintenance as much. Decide how much time and money you are willing to put into maintaining your hair color before you decide on a hair color look. 

think about how drastic you would like your color change to be.  collect physical and digital pictures of hair color looks that you like.  decide if you want to get a haircut as well.  think about how often you are willing to get touch-ups. 

 Keep a spray bottle full of water at arm's reach. When one cat starts intimidating the other, just aim and spray several times. It may take a few sprays but eventually the intimidator should get the message and scram.   Your aggressive cat should learn that when you raise the bottle it is going to get sprayed. Eventually you should just have to do this to stop the behavior but that depends on you actually spraying the offending cat quite a few times. "However, be aware the cat may associate the deterrent with you and not the other cat. At best, it might mean the cats behave when you're there but fight when you're gone. At worst, it could make the cat wary of you.  Your cats will not work their problems out through fighting. In fact, letting them fight may make their relationship even worse. If your cats are fighting, stop them by making a loud noise of some sort, basically scaring them. Try to clap really loud or slam a door, anything that will catch them off guard.   Don't try to get in the middle of a cat fight. You may get scratched or bitten in the process.  Make sure each cat has his own food and water bowls, litter box, and safe hiding places. Competition for resources increases tension and can lead to fighting.  If your cats are getting along, you should reinforce that behavior. Give them each a treat and a little affection, if they like that kind of thing. Make sure they both know that they get better treats and more affection if they get along, rather than if they are irritable and fight., An animal behaviorist or other expert may be able to find techniques to reduce feline aggression. You can also talk to your vet about techniques you can try, as well as ask for suggestions about behaviorists to contact.  

stop fights before they start.  interrupt aggressive behavior.  provide plenty of resources.  reward good behavior.  contact an expert. 

 Espresso beans are a type of different coffee beans that have less acidity than other types of coffee beans. In the Italian tradition, they are always a blend of beans that in addition to being low in acidity, are heavily bodied, and sweet.You can buy a bag of your favorite espresso roast at any coffee shop or grocery store. If you don’t know a lot about different roasts, then just look for “Espresso Roast” on the bag. If you get whole beans then you will have to grind them properly for espresso, which is a fine grind.You can substitute the espresso for strong coffee if you need, and add just a bit of sugar to mimic the sweetness of espresso.; , You will need about 3/4 a cup of milk for every cup of espresso. You don’t have to worry about frothing the milk for a Caffe Latte Freddo. Unlike the lattes you usually get at a coffee shop here, this drink has you just mixing the milk into the espresso and shaking.   Whole milk is the standard in Italy, but you can use whichever milk you prefer.Thinner milks will affect how thick your drink ends up being.  Your ice cubes shouldn’t be too large as the method for making the Caffe Latte Freddo involves shaking instead of blending.   Regular ice cube trays should be fine.  If you want your drink to taste a bit less bitter you can add sugar to your drink. While espresso roasts are sweeter than other roasts, some people still prefer an even sweeter taste.  The more pure the water, the better. If you are using water from the tap and it is full of minerals, it may affect the taste of your espresso slightly.   Most average coffee drinkers won’t really notice much of a difference, but the purer the water the more the flavors of the roast will come through.  In order to ensure that your shots are pulled at the correct temperature you should heat up the espresso maker. Plenty of modern espresso makers will automatically heat up before pulling shots.   If your machine doesn’t preheat automatically, then run your portafilter under hot water to warm it. The portafilter is where you pack in your grounds and if it is cold then this could affect the brewing temperature. If you do heat it with water, make sure it is relatively dry when you put the grounds in it.  If you have whole espresso beans and have a coffee grinder at home you can grind your beans now for a fresher taste. To ensure you get a proper grind, figure out which kind of grinder you have.   There are a couple types of grinders out there, Burr Grinders and a Blade Grinders.Blade Grinders are better for drip and French Press because they don’t usually offer a super fine grind. A Burr Grinder uses two burrs to efficiently grind your coffee beans and will be able to offer a much finer grind. If you are using a Blade Grinder, set the grinder to the highest setting for the finest grind. To see if your grind is fine enough you can do a simple test by pinching the grounds between your fingers. If a small portion clumps and stays compact between your fingers, your beans are ground fine enough.  There are several types of machines that can brew espresso. While unfortunately your drip coffee maker isn’t suited for espresso, you can find reasonably priced stovetop machines.   You can get an Italian Moka pot which makes espresso in a little metal pot that heats on your stove.If you have an espresso machine, then load it up for one shot, or a double. Most espresso machines will automatically pull a double shot, which for best results should require between 18-21 grams of grounds.If you don’t have either an espresso machine or Moka, you can use a French Press.  Ensure that your portafilter is securely locked. Then place your shot glass under the spout.For the best roast, you should pull your shots for between 22-28 seconds.  Make sure that you have measured your milk out correctly so that you get the best taste. Your end result should be a nice light brown color.   Make the mixture in a mason jar if you have one, or use a beverage shaker that will strain the drink while leaving any ice behind. Pour the espresso in first, then add the milk.  If you want your drink to be a bit sweeter, and a little more American you can add a tablespoon of sugar.   You don’t have to stir it in as the espresso will dissolve it on its own, and you’ll be shaking the entire mixture which will disperse it evenly.  If you are using a mason jar, then make sure the lid is screwed on tightly and shake as you would when mixing a drink like a shaken Martini. Use an up and down motion to best distribute and mix your ingredients.  Your glass should be large enough and suitable for serving coffee beverages.   If you used a drink mixer then pour your Caffe Latte Freddo into a clear espresso glass (or a half-pint glass if you have one), or back into your mason jar. If you shook your Caffe Latte Freddo in your mason jar and didn’t strain it, then just unscrew the lid.    If you have strained your Latte Freddo you can see if there’s any foam left in your shaker and scoop it out, placing it on top of your drink.  

get the espresso beans or espresso ground.  grab some milk.  get 8 to 10 ice cubes.  grab a tablespoon of sugar.  pour the water in your espresso machine.  preheat your espresso machine and portafilter.  grind the beans.  put the grounds in your espresso maker.  pull your shot(s).  mix one (1) cup hot espresso with 3/4 cup of cold milk.  add sugar to taste.  add ice and shake.  strain into a glass.  serve with two straws and enjoy!. 

 Before scaling, you should make sure that all layers are set to ON and UNLOCKED.   Note: Pretty much the same procedure can be used when rotating an object by an undefined angle.  This is going to be your reference length. Command: Scale --> select entire drawing, except your reference line, press space.    Type "re" (as reference), press space. Pick first point and endpoint of the object from your drawing, that you want it to be 100 units long. Type "po" (as points), press space. , Instead of you having to calculate and writing down decimals, now AutoCAD will do it instead, and the result will be most accurately scaled drawing.  

check the settings.  use the following:  command: line --> draw a line of a length that you want to use (for example, you have an object in your drawing, and you want it to be 100 units long, so draw a 100 units long line).  select the base point.  pick first point and endpoint of your referenced line that you drew.  ,  done. 

 Add up the total number of steps and divide by 7 for your average daily steps.; , These 1,000 steps equal a distance of about 1⁄2 mile (0.8 km). To accomplish this, try:   Walk instead of watching television or surfing the web. Play outdoors with kids or walk around the field while they are playing sports.  You might want to try some of these strategies to help you reach your goal:   Take your dog on longer walks. Park farther away from your destination. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Walk instead of drive to run an errand.  You may have to add a nightly walk in your neighborhood or other activity to reach this goal.  Here are some strategies to try:   Try to complete every 2,000 steps 5 minutes more quickly than you did before. Add hills or inclines to your walk. Alternate between fast and slow speeds throughout your walk. Add hand weights to your workouts.  

wear a pedometer for a week to determine how many steps you take each day.  start by adding 1,000 steps to your daily average during week 1.  add an additional 1,000 steps per day during week 2.  continue adding 1,000 steps per day each week until you reach a goal of 10,000 steps per day.  increase the intensity of your walking. 

 As long as the interval between sessions, of the lift that is in cycle, do not exceed three weeks you can still progress. Rest is the most important factor in dealing with lower back pain and the other main factors are workload, choice of exercises in your routine and form.; , An example of a strength lift, not in cycle, is doing pull-ups or pull downs instead of bent over rows. An example, of an auxiliary exercise change, is to do recumbent cycling instead of cycling.  Minimize warm ups set and reps for your lift in cycle and lifts not cycled.   If your set rep scheme is set 1 10 reps, set 2 10 reps, and set 3 (your top set) 10 reps, reduce your workload by doing just 5 reps for set 1 and 3 reps for set 2. All that matters is your top set, your personal record is for your top set and not your warm up sets. If you do legwork exercises like running or agility drills, merely reduce the total time you spend on them. When in a few weeks, your are thru with your cycle, resume your normal routine of running and everything else. Increase your poundage or reps in smaller amounts for your cycled lift. Improvise with smaller weights beside plates. Weight plates go as low as 1.25# making the weight jump 2.5#, so with improvised weights the advantage is to make the weight increases below 2.5# by using weight plates cut in half, wrist weights, fishing lead taped one, short pieces of chain etc. If using a fixed weight, repeat workouts with the same weight or do a partial, last rep.  Check the long term effects of these medications. Do not rely on these drugs in the long term, unless you are an elite athlete or have factored in the risk/ reward of them.  If getting a back massage, have it done sitting and as upright as possible. Virtually all positions where you are bent forward (or facing down) at the waist standing, sitting or lying results in back tension. If you are on a massage chair and leaning on the chair, the benefit from the massage might be cancelled by the back tension of leaning forward. Sitting, in a slightly reclined position, in a whirlpool bath is a better option.  Have a balanced life and physical routine (strength, speed, agility, endurance, active rest and flexibility).  Reach down by bending you legs and hips. Do not bend over only at the hips.  Do stretching exercises that do not stress or cause pain to your back  , The muscles of the lower back require a long recovery time to grow - be patient. Having enough rest, is far more important than meticulously watching your protein intake. Investigate the negative effects of excessive protein intake.  When your form degenerates, and it is not correctable, it should mark the end of your cycle. Read about the causes of disc herniation. Your lower back pain should be from long periods of stress and not from using incorrect form. See your internist and get referred to a specialist if you have spinal pain.  

rest.  keep going with your lift in cycle and do variations of your non-cycles lifts that do not stress the back.  modify your set/rep schemes.  take otc pain medication and vow to make changes in your routine.  sleep on your back and sides.  question your motives, goals and training methodology for the quality of your life, and your health, if you are persistently pursuing a personal record and with acute, lower back pain.  in daily life, use good form when reaching down.  when stretching avoid the standing, forward bend stretch.  consume enough protein and consume them at every meal.  practice excellent form in your lifting.

 Tips like Rubber Flat, Hole Flat, Coat Sharp and Metal Flat are best for a sliding shoot. Be sure all the other parts on your beyblade are meant for a solid Attack or this move will be ineffective.; , Figure out a place to launch your beyblade. Know the path of your beyblade so it doesn't bounce out of the stadium or into a penalty pocket. This may take a few tries to learn how your beyblade moves.  Tilt the launcher so it is in line with the concave shape of the stadium. This will give your beyblade a better angle so it will be more aggressive.  As you pull the ripcord out of the launcher push the launcher forward as if you are playing air hockey. Do not push or pull too hard, this may cause your beyblade to knock itself out or start ramming the walls of the stadium causing it to lose its spin.  Once you get it down your beyblade should make a pattern like a 4 leaf clover and make contact with the center point of the stadium. It may take a few tries to get it right but it is well worth it.  

use a round, yet flat tip.  aim.  prepare for launch.  push and pull.  practice makes perfect.

 50% of women may have no symptoms at all. Nine out of every ten men will likely experience symptoms. Painful urination, genital discharge and general abdominal/pelvic pain are obvious symptoms of gonorrhea that affect both men and women., You can get gonorrhea by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has gonorrhea. Direct contact is key. A pregnant woman with gonorrhea can also give the infection to her baby during childbirth.Take preventative steps to halt gonorrhea. Prevent Gonorrhea by using condoms, dental dams, or limiting the number of sexual partners you have.  Gonorrhea can have numerous complication. In women, gonorrhea may cause Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID). This can happen when the infection spreads to the uterus or fallopian tubes. If untreated, PID can cause chronic pelvic pain and tubal pregnancies. PID can even damage the reproductive organs and make it hard for a woman to have a baby. Gonorrhea can also make it easier for women to contract an HIV infection. Gonorrhea in men can lead to permanent painful urination., Gonorrhea is not a disease that you can cure with home remedies or sanitation. If you are sexually active or suspect that you've been with someone who has contracted gonorrhea, you should consult your doctor immediately., The most common symptom in both men and women with gonorrhea is painful/burning urination. This sensation may disappear on its own, but is often painful enough to send men to the doctor., In both men and women, gonorrhea produces a yellowish-greenish, thick discharge from the genitals. It is a secretion produced by the bacteria itself. In women this secretion can also be accompanied by bleeding between periods. It is the body’s way of expelling the foreign agent.Any unusual vaginal discharge should be examined by a doctor.  This could be a sign of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) — a common symptom of gonorrhea in women. If you have PID, you might also experience fevers greater than or equal to 101 Fahrenheit. 750,000 cases of PID are diagnosed annually. 10% of those with PID face infertility., In both men and women, gonorrhea can cause general inflammation of one’s genitals.   Women may experience swelling, redness, or soreness of the vulva (the opening of the vagina).In men, gonorrhea can lead to swollen testicles and an inflamed prostate gland., In both women and men who practice anal sex, gonorrhea can produce anal discharge and painful bowel movements. Frequent and persistent diarrhea can accompany anal gonorrhea. See your doctor immediately, if you experience these symptoms., Gonococcal pharyngitis or gonorrhea of the mouth produces sore throat, discomfort while swallowing, general redness, and whitish/yellowish discharge. The symptoms are the same for men and women. People with oral gonorrhea usually do not transmit the disease to others, but it is possible through direct contact with the back of the mouth. Kissing does not normally transmit the disease. Contact between the pharynx and body parts/objects can lead to transmission.Most people with oral gonorrhea often mistake their condition for strep throat or the common cold. Only after visiting the doctor do they discover that they have oral gonorrhea.  If you are a woman and you have reason to suspect you may be at risk for gonorrhea, get tested. Many women who are infected do not have any symptoms, or symptoms so non-specific as to be mistaken for other conditions.   Gonorrhea requires medical treatment. If left untreated, it can cause numerous serious health problems, including chronic pain and infertility in both men and women. Eventually, untreated gonorrhea can be spread to the blood and joints, which can be a life-threatening condition.  Your medical provider will take a urine sample or will swab your cervix, vagina, rectum, urethra, or throat — wherever gonorrhea is suspected. There are several tests that can be done, all of which look for the neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteria.If you are giving a urine sample, be sure not to urinate for at least 2 hours prior to the test. You want to make sure that the bacteria hasn’t been flushed out before taking the test. Most tests can be completed in a couple of days.  In some cases, gonorrhea can have lasting effects. Women may experience cervicitis, tubo-ovarian abscesses, or even ectopic pregnancies.Men may face continued pain along their epididymis (the duct that connects the testicles to the vas deferens) for up to six weeks after initial infection. , The standard treatment for gonorrhea is a 250 mg injection of ceftriaxone along with 1g of azithromycin, which is taken orally. A 400mg single dose of cefixime may be given along with 1g of azithromycin if ceftriaxone is not available.Since some strains of gonorrhea have become resistant to these medicines, you may receive additional antibiotics to treat gonorrhea. You will need to get tested for gonorrhea again in about four weeks to determine if the treatment worked or if you need to be treated with another type of medicine. You will also need to be retested every time you change sexual partners.  You want to be certain that the disease has cleared your system to avoid further transmission. 

recognize that gonorrhea affects men and women differently.  know how gonorrhea spreads.  know what happens if you don't treat gonorrhea.  visit the doctor.  see if it burns when you urinate.  watch for unusual discharge.  check for pelvic and lower abdominal pain.  check for painful or swollen genitals.  check for painful bowel movements.  see if you have difficulty swallowing.  get tested by a doctor.  take the test.  talk to your doctor about possible complications.  get medication.  wait at least seven days after completing treatment to have sex again. 

 The first step when teaching your bird the step-up command is letting it out of the cage and having it sit on a hand. After it sits on your hand you will be able to use your other hand to start teaching it how to step up.Once your bird steps out of the cage, offer your hand to it as a platform. Move slowly and make sure your bird stays comfortable.  The aim of the step up command is to have your bird step from one hand to the other. To do this you will need to bring your other hand up to the bird, offering a new platform for it to move up to. Keep some of the following tips in mind as you work with your bird:If your bird bites, move your hand in from underneath the bird. Bring your hand up to the area just above where your bird's legs meet its body. Keep your hand flat and level.  Whenever your bird steps up successfully you can offer it a reward. Giving your bird a tasty treat will help it understand that stepping up onto your other hand will result in rewards. Always offer a reward when training your bird to step-up in order to get the best results.Try to give your bird their favorite treat as a reward. Many birds love fresh vegetables, fruits, or seeds.  Without enough training your bird may forget the step-up command or never properly learn it in the first place. Whenever your bird is feeling comfortable you should try working with it, spending time with it, and reinforcing the step-up command to build even more trust. 

let the bird sit on your hand.  bring your other hand up to the bird.  reward the bird for stepping up.  practice often. 

 Either use one that you already have or build one from scratch. If you are using an existing one, it must be wide enough to accommodate the top of the stage that you'll be building in the next part. If building one from scratch, cut three base panels to the height of choice, using the following widths:  Cut one piece 59" long for the front panel. Cut two pieces 34" long for the two side pieces.   The height should be determined by what will be high enough to cover an adult squatting down behind the panel. Only your hands should be observed (covered in the puppets), none of your body or head.  Screw these into place firmly. You may also need to glue the edges together for a firm fit, that depends on how well the brackets are holding the pieces together.      The image demonstrates another option for attaching the panels together, using metal square pole joints instead of bracketing the wooden pieces closely together. Cut the flagstaffs (long poles, see image above) to size. Don't make any shelves, as they'll only get in the puppeteers' way. If you need a place to hold items, boxes can be shifted in and out from the back of the stage, as needed.  After you've built the lemonade stand, you have made the base of the puppet stage. You'll now need to make the top of the stage, from which the curtains will hang., They are now ready to be cut as follows:  Cut two pieces 59" long. These will become the long sides of the curtain-top frame. Cut another pair of pieces 34" long.These pieces will become the short sides of the frame. Cut two 23" lengths which will become the filler pieces.      ; ,      Place the 34" side pieces first. One goes on the left and the other on the right. Set the 59" front and back pieces perpendicular to the 34-inch side pieces, with their ends resting on top of the 34" pieces. This forms a rectangle. Set the 23" filler pieces on top of the 34" side pieces and between the 59" front and back pieces. You should now have a rectangle in one plane on the top. Square up the pieces using a framing square to align the outer edges.       Carefully lift up the filler pieces and put carpenter's glue along the bottom surfaces. Replace them and check the alignment with a framing square again. Drive four #8 or #10 x 1-1/4" long screws through each filler piece into the end pieces below, securing the two pieces. , Holding the long side in place, drive three 1/4-inch screws through each end, into the side piece below Avoid driving a screw in the extreme outside corner of each corner; you'll be drilling holes for the curtain rods there later.,, (Perfection is not required.), At each corner, square a line 3-% inches in from each outside edge, so that you have two lines that intersect. Use an awl to punch each intersection point. , Repeat at the other three corners., Square lines across the nearer long side 28 inches (71.1 cm) in from either end. On one of these lines, mark a point 1 inch (2.5 cm) in from the near edge of the frame.,, Mark the point where the two lines intersect. Do the same on the other far corner. If there is a screw in the way at these crosshairs, rake it out now., Drill a hole all the way through the top frame at each of the four points you've marked.  These smaller holes are for the curtain-rod ends.  Each one should measure 11 f 'ct by 12 inches., You should now have three 11-feet by 6-inch lengths of cloth., surface. Clamp the frame in place. Then find the center of the front edge of the frame and make a small pencil mark there., At the midpoint, staple the unfolded edge of the cloth to the center of the front edge of the frame, keeping the edge of the cloth flush with the top edge of the frame. At this stage, the unfolded edge of cloth should be stapled to the wood and the folded edge should hang down.   Grab hold of the top edge of the cloth a few inches to the left of the midpoint. Bring that top edge back against the midpoint staple, making a loop of cloth that points out toward you. Keeping the top edge in position, flatten the loop to the left and staple its end to the edge of the frame. The new staple should be just about an inch away from the midpoint staple. You've just made one pleat.    Grab the cloth a few inches to the left of the pleat, pull the top edge back to the staple you just placed. Fold the loop of cloth down to the left, and staple it flush to the top edge of the top frame. Working to the left, create a series of flat, folded pleats across the top of the top frame. The end result will appear just like the tops of old-fashioned curtains.   Try to keep each of the folds even, stapling every inch or so. You may also find that pleating may be an easier task with two people working together, one to fold and hold the cloth and the other to staple.  Get another length of fabric, and keep going. Overlap the new fabric over the "ruffle" of the old fabric by an inch or so. , At this point, cut the fabric about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) longer than you need, and fold this extra underneath before putting in the last staple, just before the corner.,, Start at the end of one short side, moving across the front, and finishing on the other short side. Cut off any excess ribbon when you are finished.  Gluing, smoothing, and holding the ribbon in place may require a few extra sets of hands.   The result will be a beautiful finished ruffle.  Each piece should be 5 1⁄2 feet (1.7 m) long (but longer is okay too).,, Iron it down. Then, staple it in place., Then bring the other piece of fabric to the work surface, ironing and stapling using the same three folds., Figure out how much you'll have to fold over to make the final width of each cloth 36 inches (91.4 cm). If your fold is more than 2 inches (5.1 cm), use two or even three rows of staples to hold it down.  Alternatively, you can trim off some of the extra cloth to make your fold less than 2 inches (5.1 cm).  Start at a corner and place a clip every 6 inches (15.2 cm) or so., Bend them until they are basically straight.       To bend (or straighten) the tubing, grasp it with both hands, with your thumbs pointing toward each other and about an inch apart. Gently push in with your thumbs until you feel the tubing move. Shift your hands along the tubing and press down again with your thumbs, bending the tubing just a little in each place along its length to avoid creating kinks.  Mark both tubes together at three even intervals where the tubing is going to be bent into shape: a bend in from each end of the tubes and one bend in the middle. The two end bends at each side should be exactly the same measurement in from the ends, about 11 inches in from each end, while the center bend is dead center, 31 3/4 inches from the end (see the image to help you see where to make the bend points).  Hold the end you have just measured from in your right hand. About 11/2 inches (5.1 cm) from the end, begin bending the tubing. Bend a little, moving your hands farther down, then bend a little more. When you reach the first layout mark on the tubing, stop bending and check your progress.  Your goal is to make the tubing turn 90 degrees evenly between the end of the tube and the first layout mark. Adjust the curve being shaped by bending more (or unbending if necessary), spreading your efforts along the whole length of bent tubing. (Perfection is not required, and you will be able to make adjustments later.)  , Begin making a second bend along a horizontal plane, trying to complete a 90-degree turn by the time you reach the third layout mark. You should end up with a left-hand bend., Make the end bend as for the first end bend., The second curtain rod will be a mirror image of the first., Hold the completed curtain rods up to the curtain frame to check their alignment, remembering that they overlap at the center of the frame., The rods should curve around the outside of the larger holes (so that on opening night the curtain can follow the same path around the pole that will run through the holes). If the rods are out of alignment, bend them into position now., Slip the curtains onto them., Work the ends of the rods down into the holes until they reach all the way through the frame to the work surface., Drive the sheet-metal screws into the tubing until the screw head contacts the wood frame. This is an unorthodox use of screws and copper tubing, but with some extra force, the threads should bite into the copper and flare it right against the sides of the drilled hole.     

start with a lemonade stand.  attach the side pieces to the front pieces using brackets.  put to one side.  stack the two 1"x6" boards on top of each other with their ends even.  position the cut pieces on your work surface.  glue up the top frame.  lift up one of the long sides and put glue on the top surfaces of the two ends beneath it.  ,  replace the piece.repeat previous step with the other long side.  check the alignment one last time and try to get the top frame as close to square as you can.  when the glue is dry, turn the top frame over.  put the 1 1/4-inch forester bit in the drill chuck set the spur of the bit in one of the small holes you punched with the awl.  ,  drill a hole all the way through the long side and the end piece beneath it.  turn the top frame upside down on your work surfaces, with the filler pieces facing down and the short sides to your left and right.on the other line, mark a point 2 inches (5.1 cm) in from the near edge of the frame.  reach across to the long side away from you and square a line 1 inch (2.5 cm) in from each edge at one of the far comers.  put the 5/16-inch bit in the drill chuck.  cut the ruffle cloth into three 12-inch-widc s tulips.  fold each piece in half lengthwise and run a hot iron along the folds.  turn the top frame so that the filler pieces face up and one of the long sides hangs about 2 inches (5.1 cm) off the front of the wad (?),  find the midpoint of one of the pieces of ruffle cloth.  make the first pleat.  make the next pleat.  when you reach the end of the cloth, staple the end to the frame.when you get to the corner of the top frame, turn and reclamp the frame on the work surface and turn the corner with the fabric.  continue pleating until you reach the end of the short side.  go back to the middle of the front and repeat the pleating and stapling process, working to the right, until you have completed the ruffle all the way across the front and the other short side.  ,  glue a long piece of ribbon along the top of the ruffle to hide the staples.  cut the curtain fabric in half.lay one of the pieces of fabric flat on the work surface.  on one of the long sides, fold over 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the edge.  repeat this process on both of the short sides of the top frame.  fold, iron, and staple the remaining long sides.  clip the curtain loops to one of the long sides of each piece.  uncoil the two lengths of copper tubing.  when the copper tubing is straightened, lay the two lengths side by side.  grab one length of tubing in both hands.  grip the tube at the second mark (31 3/4 inches from the end, in the center), with the bent end on your right and pointing up.  hold the tubing with the unworked end on your left, the second bend pointing downward, and the first bend pointing toward you.  repeat.  place the curtain frame upside down with the 5/16 -inch holes in the corners closest to you.  insert the ends a short way into the 5/16-inch hole until the rods support themselves.  remove the curtain rods one at a time.  insert the ends of the rod back into the 3/16–inch holes.  set the frame on edge with its top surface facing you. 

 As soon as the dog is moved to safety, check to see if it is breathing. To do so, watch its chest to see if it is rising and falling. If there is no movement, it is not breathing and you should perform artificial respiration, which is where you assist the dog in breathing.You may also need to perform artificial respiration if the dog has labored breathing, is unconscious, or shows other signs of respiratory suppression, like blue or pale-colored gums, or a staring expression., To perform artificial respiration, first lay the dog on its side on a flat surface, pulling the neck and head forward (as long as the dog has no neck or back injuries)., Next, open the dog’s mouth and pull its tongue forward with your fingers. Clear any debris from the dog’s mouth that may be preventing it from breathing or causing it to choke. Once you have removed any debris, close the dog’s mouth.   You may need to remove the muzzle for this step. Be careful even if the dog is unconscious, as it could wake up at any moment. Put the muzzle back on once you have cleared its mouth of debris., After reapplying the muzzle, inhale and place your mouth over the dog’s nose, forming an airtight seal around it. Exhale into the dog’s nose.Exhale just enough so that the chest expands. You will have to exhale harder for larger dogs and more gently for smaller dogs. Lift the dog’s chin while you are doing this so its throat is straight., Remove your mouth from the dog’s nose after you exhale and allow the dog’s chest to deflate., After the dog’s chest deflates, check to see if it has a pulse. The dog’s heart can still be beating even if it is not breathing. If you cannot find a pulse, you should start chest compressions immediately.Check for a pulse by placing two fingers on the inside of the dog’s rear thigh., If there is another person present, have them help you resuscitate the dog—one of you will perform chest compressions while the other continues artificial respiration. Have one person perform three chest compressions after every time you exhale into the dog’s nose. If you are alone, do five chest compressions for every breath. Use the following procedures to perform chest compressions:   For small dogs (30 pounds or less): Lay the dog on its side on a flat surface. Place one hand on top of the other, interlocking your fingers. Place the palm of the bottom hand on the rib cage, over the dog’s heart. Press down, compressing the chest about one inch. Squeeze and release this hold steadily at a rate of 80 to 100 compressions per minute. For large dogs (over 30 pounds): Lay the dog on its side on a flat surface. Place one hand on top of the other, interlocking your fingers. Place the bottom hand over the widest part of the dog’s rib cage (not necessarily over the heart). Push down on the rib cage, keeping your arms straight. Compress the chest about one quarter of its width. Continue to squeeze and release rhythmically at a rate of around 80 compressions per minute., You may need to repeat this process 15 to 20 times per minute (or one breath every three seconds, on average) to get the dog breathing normally. When the dog starts to fight the process or you notice its gums are returning to their normal color, the dog’s breathing is improving and you can stop artificial respiration. 

check to see if the dog is breathing.  lay the dog on its side.  clear any debris from inside the dog’s mouth.  breath into the dog’s nose.  remove your mouth.  check for a pulse.  start chest compressions if there is no heart beat.  repeat this process. 

 Dates can be compared with the equals, after and before methods. If two dates are for the same point in time, the equals method will return true.

 Gratitude is an act of honoring the wonderful things in your life. It’s like thanking the universe for what you appreciate and sending the message “Yes, more, please!” Instead of dwelling on what you don’t like, when you turn your attention to what you appreciate, you invite more of this into your life.Find your bliss by expressing gratitude for the good in your life. Each day, write down at least three things, people, or events that you are thankful for.  As you slowly build awareness of yourself, you may start to notice the things, activities, people or events that make you feel especially euphoric. Let your pile of good things grow by doing more and more of these things.Make a list of the things that bring you incredible joy. Do them as often as you can. For instance, you might find joy in singing. If so, find a way to sing nearly every day.  You will spend a lot of your life working, so it’s a great idea to do something that brings you joy. This may not even be your occupation, but a side job or passion project. When you do work that you feel is purposeful and enjoyable, you are more engaged and less stressed.If you’re not already doing work that speaks to your passion, figure out what that might be. See a career counselor, job-shadow someone, or read a book about an industry that piques your interest.  Volunteering and charity work can bring about a deep sense of purpose for you. It also helps you feel connected to your community. Acts of selflessness like this are great for others, but they benefit you, too. Giving back has been shown to increase the lifespan, lower depression, boost self-esteem, and lead to more happiness.Find a cause you feel inspired by and get behind it. Dedicate a few hours each week or month to community service. Write a check to a charity you believe in. Or, volunteer to help out a neighbor or a friend.  

practice gratitude.  recreate your happiest moments.  do meaningful work.  give back.

 The best way to use an ice cream machine is to follow the instructions that came with the model of machine you purchased. If you do not have the instructions, you can likely find time on the manufacturer’s website. However, the description below should fit most ice cream makers.  Many ice cream makers come with a bowl that should be frozen completely (usually for 24-hours) prior to making ice cream. Sometimes the bowl has liquid between the inner and outer walls of the bowl that freezes to help keep the product cold.Old-fashioned ice cream makers that do not have a frozen bowl may have a stainless steel (or other metal) bowl that sits inside a bucket of ice and rock salt. The salt helps melt the ice, which makes for a colder environment around the outside of the bowl.  Most ice cream machines have a detachable paddle that stirs the mixture inside. Put the paddle in place per the manufacturer’s instructions.  Remove the sorbet mixture from your refrigerator (where it has been cooling) and carefully pour it into the ice cream maker bowl.  The ice cream maker should do most (if not all) of the work for you. Turn it on and it will spin for a set amount of time or until the mixture is frozen.Some models have a timer on them for a pre-determined length of mixing time, while others will automatically shut off once they meet a certain amount of resistance (caused by the frozen mixture).  Depending on your machine, your sorbet may be very soft when it finishes mixing. If this is the case, you may want to place the sorbet in an air-tight container and put it in your freezer to harden.  

consult your machine’s manual.  freeze the bowl.  place the bowl into the machine and add the paddle or stirrer.  pour the sorbet mixture in the bowl.  turn the machine on.  re-freeze the mixture for a firmer texture. 

 Over the counter pain relievers can help to reduce inflammation and pain from mouth ulcers. Try taking a pain reliever such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. These pain relievers will not necessarily heal your ulcers, but they can help to relieve pain caused by the ulcers while the ulcer heals.   You can also use topical products like Anbesol, which is applied locally for pain relief. Use these products for children and adults as directed., There are multiple kinds of medicine that can help mouth ulcers. Topical corticosteroid preparations, such as triamcinolone paste or Orabase, can help treat sores on your lips or gums. Blistex and Campho-Phenique provide relief against the pain of canker sores and cold sores.   These work best if you apply them at the first sign of a mouth ulcer., If you have serious issues with your mouth ulcers, you can get medication from your doctor to help. Your doctor may prescribe medication such as Zovirax or Denavir, which can reduce the healing time of the ulcer by half a day. They also decrease the pain associated with the inflammatory response.   If you have a severe cold sore, your doctor may prescribe oral antiviral medications, which can be used to help heal the herpes simplex virus stomatitis that causes them. These include medications like acyclovir, valacyclovir and famciclovir. 

take pain relievers.  treat ulcers with over the counter medications.  take prescription medication. 

 Identical twins often have different personalities. If you've known a pair of twins for awhile, you may be able to tell them apart based on personality. For example, Alice may be very shy and withdrawn, while Sophie is a social butterfly. If you see one of the twins out walking, and she smiles and yells, "Hi!", you're likely dealing with Sophie.  Twins may have a different speaking style. You can use this as a means to identify twins. Returning to the above example, as Sophie is more social, she may use common slang and colloquial terms in conversation. As Alice is more withdrawn, and spends a lot of time at home, she may have not picked up on as much slang. She may be unlikely to use certain terms and phrases in conversation, sticking to more formal sentences.  Twins may also have slightly different mannerisms and habits, which you may pick up on if you've spent a lot of time with the twins. One twin may have a habit of twirling his hair, for example, while another may bite his fingernails. One twin may gesticulate more when he or she talks, while another may be more reserved in conversation.  It's okay to ask politely. While twins may sometimes get slightly annoyed, many identical twins understand others have trouble differentiating between them. If you're really in doubt, politely say something like, "I'm sorry, but are you Mason or Todd?" Thank the twin for answering, and let him or her know you'll try to do better in the future. 

assess personality.  pay attention to speaking style.  look at habits and mannerisms.  ask politely when in doubt. 

 Drop it and let it bounce. As the ball begins to descend after this bounce, kick it back up into the air. Try to kick it with your dominant foot hard enough that it reaches chest height. Try to kick the ball with your foot angled slightly upward. Make sure to kick the ball with your laces.          Make sure that your laces are not double knotted at first. The ball may bounce off of your laces at a weird angle if your laces are tied in a large knot. If you deflate the soccer ball a little bit, you will reduce the intensity of its bounce. The ball will be easier to control and won’t go flying every time you miss a kick.Once you’ve mastered the technique of juggling, you should fully inflate your ball. Keep your ankle 'locked' so that it stays angled and strong. A wobbly ankle leads to a wobbly kick.; , Doing this will help you have better control over the ball. Do not lock your knees. Keep the foot you are not kicking with (your controlling foot) flat and firmly planted on the ground.         It is important to be balanced while juggling the ball. In between touches, it is risky but useful to try to re-balance yourself such that you can maintain control of how you hit the ball each time. Always try to stay balanced on your toes, ready to make quick movements. The biggest keys to balancing is to keep you knees bent and your eyes on the ball.  You should not have to lean or reach to catch the ball. Then do the same with your other foot. Keep in mind that juggling with your non-dominant foot will be harder. Keep at it!         , Instead of catching the ball every time you kick it, kick it up into the air and as it falls, kick it up again rather than letting it bounce on the ground. Try to keep the ball under control. Focus on juggling with one foot until you feel confident, then switch to the other foot. Practice until you feel confident juggling with both feet.          You can "catch" the ball on your foot with careful practice by cushioning the fall of the ball and holding it in place with your foot and shin.  

hold the ball straight out in front of you so that it is at the height of your chest.  keep your knees slightly bent.  practice until you can easily and consistently catch the ball in front of your stomach.  increase the number of times you let the ball bounce off your feet. 

 Most people should avoid lifting a dog of 40 pounds or greater by themselves. Every person will have his own weight limit for lifting, so please think of the safety of your pet and yourself when deciding to pick up your dog.   Animals will struggle more if they feel like they may fall because they are not supported properly or you are fumbling to hold body parts.; , Even if your dog weighs less than 20 pounds, it's important to pick him up carefully. Locate your dog's chest right behind the dog’s front legs. Support the dog here when you start to lift. Use your right hand to hold on to the dog’s collar or leash. This keeps him from running away and lets you control his head. Bring your left arm over the top of your dog’s back and lift him from under the chest.Bring the dog under your left arm or “wing.” Hold him to your body to minimize wiggling.  If your dog weighs more than 20 pounds, pick him up with one hand under his neck and the other scooped under his rump. At the same time, lift like you're lifting a board.For dogs over 40 pounds, get another person to help. One person will be at the head of the dog with one arm under the neck and the other under the chest. The other person gets a hand under the belly and their other hand scoops under the rump. Lift at the same time.   The person at the head of the dog will “call the shots” and give directions when to lift at the same time. For instance, you can count to “three” and lift the dog together on “3.”  , For a dog in advanced pregnancy, one that has an obviously distended abdomen, avoid the belly area. Lift from under her neck/chest and under the rump. Or, if you suspect your dog has an injured back, lift the dog keeping its back completely level and straight from under the neck and the rump.   Definitely get another person to help. This will keep everyone safe.  Don’t forget to bend at the knees and lift with your legs. Don't bend over the dog to protect your back from injury. Place your arms around your pet to securely lift the dog.   Bending your knees will bring you closer to the dog’s level. This means you won't be leaning over the dog which most dogs find frightening.  Try to avoid picking up your dog when he's jumping all around and wiggly. You may have to work on training your dog to be calm.   Establish a routine and begin short training sessions. Begin by keeping your dog in a seated position for several minutes. Gradually teach him to lay down. Practice having these calm periods of time., If you have to pick up a wiggler, use a short leash to keep a hold your dog. Or you could place a towel over his head and use it to hold his limbs.   If your dog is actually injured, protect yourself by muzzling the dog (with an actual muzzle for dogs or use a leash to wrap around the snout). At least use a towel over the dog’s head before you pick up the dog.  

get help if your dog is heavy.  pick up small dogs properly.  lift heavier dogs with care.  learn how to lift a dog in a special circumstance.  keep your body in the correct position when lifting.  pick up your dog when he's relaxed.  use a towel or short leash. 

 Manure is a magnet for flies. You can help to keep your horse’s eyes safe but swiftly removing all manure in your stable area., Like manure, flies are drawn to dank areas with standing water. If possible, eliminate puddles and other places where water has accumulated to reduce the fly population and keep your horse’s eyes safe., A natural way to target the fly population in your area is to introduce predatory wasps. These can usually be obtained from your local feed store. Simply allowing a nest of wasps to accumulate in your area will significantly impact the flies.These wasps are not dangerous to horses.  Finally, a simple way to reduce the number of flies that have access to your horse is to install flytraps in and around your stable. This may include glue strips, insect zappers, or catch and release traps. 

remove all manure right away.  eliminate standing water.  introduce predatory wasps.  use flytraps. 

 It is a good idea to enter each category of expense in a separate section of your tax diary for easy calculations. The following are categories that are often computed and deducted on small business taxes:   Deduct all employee payments. These can be part-time, full-time or contract employees. Employee payments are deductible as necessary business expenses. Deduct the cost of an office and office expenses. Included in this is rent, mortgage payments, repairs, equipment, furniture, software, professional publications, utilities, supplies and more. Even if you have a home office, as long as you have a dedicated space from which you do business, you will be able to deduct the cost of rent. Deduct professional and legal expenses. You should also include dues to professional organizations and organization dues. Deduct advertising expenses. This may also include travel to get new business, business gifts, websites, ads and more. Deduct the cost of goods sold. For many businesses, this is the cost of the inventory, either made or bought. Deduct insurance premiums. For self-employed people, this can include health insurance premiums, as long as they are paid individually and not available through a spouse. For small businesses, you can deduct liability and worker's compensation insurance. Deduct transportation expenses. You can choose to deduct the cost of a vehicle for a business, or you can deduct mileage based on that year's tax formula, such as $.50 per mile. Deduct bad debts, interest on loans, charity contributions, education and training, depreciation, capital expenses, theft and anything else that was a reasonable expense and is listed in the tax deductions booklet.  

keep track of common tax deductions. 

 The interviewer will likely try to put you at ease before he or she begins asking questions. Make sure you are able to comfortably chat about the weather or the traffic.; , Most social work positions involve working with people, on behalf of government or community agencies.  An interviewer will ask you specific questions about your educational background in social work and your work experience.   Prepare to discuss your degree level. Most entry-level positions in social work will only require a bachelor's degree, but if you are applying for a position at a higher level, you will need to have a master's degree or be in the process of pursuing one.  Be sure you understand what the organization does, who it serves and what its leadership structure is like.  You will be asked why you are a good fit, so prepare to explain how your strengths match the position.  Most social work interviews will require you to use past experiences to explain how you would handle present situations.   Make a list of specific cases, clients and supervisors that you can quickly and easily call to mind to demonstrate your experience and abilities. Provide details. Explain how one case helped you handle frustrations better, or why working out your differences with a certain co-worker made you a better team player.  You might be asked where you see yourself in 5 years, or whether you plan to further your education.  You will need to be able to speak authoritatively and intelligently on developments that might be occurring in the areas of social work.   Prepare to share insight and opinions. For example, if you are interviewing at an agency that serves homeless people, be ready to discuss what churches are doing for outreach. If you are interviewing with a cancer center, be ready to discuss health care for those in poverty.  There is always time for you to ask questions during an interview. Never say you do not have any.   Ask what the interviewer likes about working for the agency. You might also want to ask about his or her management style, if that person will be your direct supervisor. Ask any other questions you can think of that are relevant to your employment there and demonstrate your interest in and knowledge about the organization.  

practice your small talk.  review the job description.  review your own qualifications.  research the agency or organization.  be able to explain why you are applying for the job.  prepare for behavioral interviewing.  anticipate questions about your career goals.  stay informed about current events in the social work field.  make a list of questions you will ask. 

 Deeper wounds can involve profuse bleeding and may necessitate the use of oral antibiotics to prevent infection, even from a fully vaccinated cat.You will typically be prescribed Augment 875/125 mg, to be taken twice daily for 7 to 10 days.   Before seeking treatment from a medical professional, you may want begin treatment at home. Be sure to go to the doctor after taking the following steps to treat the wound.  If the wound is bleeding heavily, apply pressure to the area with a clean towel. Press the towel firmly to the bleeding area and hold in place until the bleeding subsides. You may also need to elevate the wound above your head., After washing your hands thoroughly, gently wash the wounded area with soap and rinse with clean water.Do not scrub while you are washing, as this may restart the bleeding.  Use a second clean towel to completely dry the wound and the area around the scratch.  Deep wounds should be covered (or closed) using an adhesive bandage (a Band-Aid), a butterfly bandage, or clean gauze dressings.If the wound is wide, bring the edges of the wound together so that there is no gap between them and apply a butterfly bandage, which should pinch the cut together. Apply several butterfly bandages as necessary to close the edges of the wound together, which will facilitate proper and quick healing. If you do not have adhesive bandages, you can cover the area with gauze dressing, keeping it in place with medical tape.  

seek medical treatment.  stop the bleeding.  wash the scratch area.  dry the wound.  cover the scratch wound. 

 Is your song going to be classic music? Is it going to be rock or jazz? Maybe your song is going to be Caribbean themed? This is the time to decide, as later, it might be too late.; , You will realize that at the bottom of the screen, there are many colours. Each coloured square represents a different pitched note. You place down your notes by clicking on the square of the note that you want to place down and clicking on the screen. You can click on the squares of the notes at the bottom of the screen to see what note they play. Write your song and make sure that it matches the theme you planned out at the beginning.  Bugs are the little tiny instruments with eyes going through the screen at all times. You are allowed four of them in the screen at once. Use the tweezers option to pick up a bug and run it through the notes you placed. It doesn't matter which bug you select. If the bug isn't turned in the direction that you want it to be, shake it in the tweezers until it does. If you like the way the music sounds, then move onto the next step. It you don't like the way the music sounds, then make some last minute corrections. If the the notes are good but the theme sounds wrong, don't worry because that's because of the bug you chose.  You have to select the 'bugs' button and from there, you select your bugs. You have a large list of bugs to choose from now but you are only allowed one yellow bug, one blue bug, one green bug, and one red bug. You can see what sounds the bug plays by clicking on the sound button located just below the bug. By clicking on the sound button, you can see if the bug is a good bug to use to play your song, as each bug represents a different musical instrument. After you chose your four bugs that will play your song, click on the 'OK' button.  The notes in the game are made to represent musical notes and also, they can draw pictures as each one has a different colour. Now you can draw a picture that matches the theme of your song somewhere on the screen by clicking on the colour you want and placing it down. Make sure that you keep you notes that your bugs play away from the picture so they don't get mixed up together.  You do this by placing one or more of your bugs on the notes that you wanted it to play. You use the tweezers to get the bug(s) to the notes. Now sit back and enjoy the music. If you still have any corrections to make, you should do them immediately.  You do this by clicking on 'file', and then 'save'. Now you have to fill in three boxes. In the one that says 'artist', put your name there. In the one that says 'title', put the title of your song there. In the box that says 'description', you can put a brief description of your song including the theme, the bugs you used, and when you made your song.  

plan out the theme of your song.  start to write your song.  have a bug go through the notes you placed.  choose your bugs.  draw a picture.  play the song.  save your song.

Discuss your symptoms with your therapist and work on creating treatment goals to improve your symptoms and coping.   You can discuss medication with your therapist before visiting a doctor. For more information, check out How to Know if You Have Depression and How to Know if You Have Anxiety.  It can be difficult to know who to share your fertility problems with and how much to share. At the same time, it can feel like keeping your sadness or frustration to yourself is killing you. Therapy is a safe place to talk about all issues related to infertility and how they make you feel. It’s okay to discuss whatever comes up for you emotionally around fertility, such as feeling like a failure, feeling frustrated with your partner, or resenting the fact that other people are having unplanned pregnancies around you.Try not to feel embarrassed, ashamed, or guilty when you talk to the therapist. They have probably encountered this situation before, and they may be able to help you cope with it.  Infertility can take a toll on your self-worth.You may feel like less of a woman or less of a man due to your inability to conceive. You may feel like a failure or like your body has turned against your desires. It can be traumatic to feel like you cannot go through with such a natural function. If you’re struggling with self-worth, talk about this with your therapist.   Infertility treatments can affect your body in different ways, and this might cause body image issues. You can bring these up to your therapist as part of your treatment. For some tips to increase your self-worth, check out How to Build Self Worth.  If you decide to get therapy together, choose a therapist together as well. Choose someone who both of you feel comfortable around and willing to open up to in therapy. When dealing with infertility, couples’ therapy can be hugely beneficial.Remember that a good therapist will work with both of you. They should not take sides. You may choose to see a marriage and family therapist (MFT) who specializes in working with couples. You may also find an infertility specialist.  When dealing with fertility issues and treatment options, you and your partner may disagree on what is best. This can cause significant strain in the relationship. Use therapy as a way to address issues and to reduce conflicts and stress. It’s common for couples to disagree on treatment options, and a therapist can help you sort through your options and communicate your needs more effectively together.When under such intense stress such as going through infertility problems, it’s important to strengthen your communication and bond with each other in order to support one another.  Therapy is an opportunity for you and your partner to talk openly and honestly with each other. Avoiding difficulties may make them worse. If you’re having a hard time or experiencing more conflict with your partner, talk it out in therapy.For example, if one person wants to continue treatments and the other does not, this can cause strain in your relationship. Express these strains openly with your therapist and find ways to approach these differences constructively together. If one person is infertile, it can cause guilt or anger in the partnership. Talk about these feelings openly.  You may have specific items that you and your partner are struggling to resolve. Brings these concerns up to the therapist as central to your therapy.Especially if you feel overwhelmed by options or by making the “right” choice, it can be helpful to talk over your options with a therapist. He or she can help guide you in this process.   For example, you may want to consider all of your options in how to proceed. You and your partner may need to create some clarity over medical treatments, adoption, using a surrogate, or even separation. This process will encourage you to compromise with your partner. Remember that you may have to concede on some things.  Some couples may notice a dramatic shift in sexual pleasure when dealing with infertility. Instead of having sex for pleasure and connection, sex may be specifically calculated for certain times in order to conceive. This can leave couples feeling less connected during sex or less fulfilled in their sexual encounters. You may also begin to experience related sexual dysfunction due to the pressures to perform and conceive.Bring up sex during therapy if it has become a problem in your relationship. Remember that most things are up for discussion when working with a therapist, even sex!  , Your therapist may recommend that you join a support group. A support group can be helpful in joining you with other couples who have similar experiences as you.A support group is a great place to share advice and support, talk about recommendations, and talk about your experiences. It can also help you feel less alone and isolated in your struggles.   Ask your therapist, general practitioner, or local mental health clinic for recommendations for joining an infertility support group. You can also check online resources and forums. A similar option is group therapy. Like support groups, you will be with other people who have fertility problems, but the group will be led by a trained mental health professional instead of a volunteer.  You may find it helpful to discuss your process with friends and family. Loved ones can be a significant source of support and love during difficult times.Talk to people who will listen and comfort you. While some people may want to give advice, say that what you need most is comfort and support.   Sometimes family members have a difficult time relating or understanding fertility problems. If someone gives you bad advice (“Just relax! You’ll get pregnant when you least expect it!”), you don’t have to confide in him or her. It’s your choice what you share and with whom you share it. If you are comfortable with it, you can tell family and friends what type of support you need during this time. This will give them clear expectations of how to act.  Fertility problems and treatments can cause considerable stress, both to the person receiving treatments and to the relationship. Get into a habit of managing stress regularly by doing activities such as daily yoga, qi gong, tai chi, and meditation or guided imagery.Better yet, find a relaxation technique that you and your partner can do together, and practice it 30 minutes or more each day.  Creative outlets can help you process your emotions in a healthy and safe manner. These can be shared with your therapist or kept private, if you choose. Some options include:  Writing in a journal. Painting or drawing. Making crafts. Learning to play an instrument.

 If you want to get a new bed, don't go king or queen sizes. Try out a double. A double is big enough for you and your mate (if you have one), and can be as cheap as one hundred dollars or equivalent.; , Try teen bedding, and you can find tons of (just as) mature bedding. And, children's bedding is often so much cheaper, my little pony bed sheets at 28, why not! (Unless they specialize for children)  , Do you like to show off your creative (and possibly artistic) side? If so, you must want wall art. But paintings and designs are SO expensive! Well, you can get original-artist paintings at art.com. They often have sales, too! Then provide all sorts of wall art.  You may want new furniture, especially since it's been beat up over the years. Try Target, which has many sales and is, quite frankly, cheap! They have lots of selection, from shelves to desks to nightstands. Second hand shops are a good option too.

If you head down to Target or Walmart, they have pretty vases in all sorts of shapes and colors, starting at 3 dollars.  Night lamps? No problem! Check out Target's store and website. They have a hunk of colors, if not every single one. They also last long, and you just place in some batteries! (Switches come in different types)  , If you want a new laptop, don't always assume you must have a Macintosh computer. You can always pick a different kind! You can get the same great quality in a Dell. The cheapest computers I've ever seen are Fujitsu. They can be as low as one hundred and fifty dollars. And, what's the difference? Macs are just gadgets that you can get free if you have Google Chrome.  For a TV, flat screens aren't so important. You can get a perfectly square, high-definition plasma screen for about 50 dollars cheaper. Stores will constantly try to get more out of you.

 Some watercolor artists only use a single brush. The most common brush you’ll use water coloring is a size 5-8, round brush.A round brush has rounded bristles that come to form a fine tip at the end. They are versatile brushes, and can paint detail and larger areas. A good watercolor brush will be able to hold a lot of water and paint.   Sable brushes are the best but most expensive brushes to use for water coloring.If you’re on a budget, try buying a synthetic brush.  Watercolor pencils are a great alternative to real paint if you’re a beginner. They work like regular pencils, but interact with water on paper to create paint. Tube watercolor paint looks similar to acrylic paint and needs to be diluted with water as well. Tubed paint is necessary if you want to paint on larger canvasses, or want to give a deeper and richer feeling to your watercolor paintings. Pan sets on the other hand are hardened paints that come as a box set.Pan sets are great for smaller paintings, or if you’re on the go.   If you are brand new to painting all together you should look into watercolor pencils. If you’ve painted using other mediums however, tubed paint will probably feel more familiar to you. Pan sets are great for beginners as well.  There are different varieties, weights, and textures of paper that you can get. Heavier paper is more expensive, but will be able to hold your paint better, while lighter paper might buckle or wrinkle when touching water. Rough paper will take your paint and water well and gives your painting luminosity.There is students’ and artists’ quality paper. Artist quality is higher grade and will stand the test of time, while student grade paper may yellow over time. The difference between regular paper and watercolor paper is the level of absorbency. Regular computer paper is too absorbent and will cause your paint to spiderweb.Some paper is also tinted off white which can give your paintings a different effect.  

buy a size 5-8 round watercolor brush.  purchase watercolor pencils, tubed paint, or a pan set.  purchase watercolor paper.

 Keep your eye on stores with used clothing or ones that specifically curate vintage clothing from the ‘60s and other decades.   If you care to find perfectly authentic items from the decade, do some research into the brand and style to find out when it was made, or ask an expert on vintage clothing to help you authenticate it. Check out garage sales, estate sales, and flea markets for other great options and potential hidden gems.  Check sites like eBay and other online stores where individual sellers advertise their vintage clothing or personal pieces that they’ve held onto since the ‘60s.   There are also a number of online stores like ModCloth that bring very retro styles, including hippie style, into modern-day clothing.  Tie dye your own shirt, headband, or any other clothing item or accessory using rubber bands or string to tie up white fabric and create patterns with different colored dyes.   Create all kinds of patterns with tie dye, like a spiral, stripes, polka dots, or rosettes.  If you enjoy making your own clothes or want to learn how, you can pick up your own fabrics in earth tones and floral patterns and use them to follow sewing patterns for the items you want to make, like bellbottoms or mini skirts.   Some fabric stores may sell retro sewing patterns, or you can check out online shops or antique malls for those that sell truly vintage patterns straight from the ‘60s!, Add fringe, embroidery, patches, or beading to the hems, sleeves, and seams of nearly any piece of clothing to give it some extra hippie flair.   Make any pair of pants into bellbottoms by cutting open the seam along the outside of the calves and sewing in a triangular piece of fabric.You can also add fun wide sleeves to a top with a circle of fabric attached to the end of each existing sleeve.If you don’t want to buy clothes or modify your clothes, simply pair different textures, colors and patterns in your wardrobe that you would never ordinarily think to put together. Hippie style means anything goes, as long as you like it!  , Get ideas for what to buy and how to wear it by studying some of the women that made hippie fashion popular in the 1960s. Look up images of icons online or in books to get a sense of their styles.   Try out the look of tousled hair and big round glasses that Janis Joplin wore, the natural afro and maxi dresses of Marsha Hunt, or the shawls and flowing shirts of Stevie Nicks. Finding a fashion icon can help you narrow down the specific type of hippie style you want to emulate, be it peasant folk singer, blues rocker, or psychedelic babe.  

search vintage and thrift stores.  look online at private sellers.  make your own tie dye items.  sew your own clothes and accessories.  modify existing clothes.  emulate a ‘60s icon. 

 Examples are cars, flags, plastic bags, the cart you plan to use, young children, dogs, and anything else that might one day cross his path. Being traffic-wise is even more important to a driving horse, as places to drive off-road are rare.; , He will need to get used to having something placed on his back. Be sure to let straps gently touch his legs and get him used to having his tail handled. Treats may be a good reward.  Even if the horse is broke to ride you should introduce the bridle gently as he will not be used to blinders (solid pieces of leather on a harness bridle that keep the horse from seeing the cart behind him). Most people start with either a snaffle or a solid rubber bit. You may have to spend a while before the horse becomes comfortable with the bit and the blinders.  If you have done your homework well, your horse should accept the harness with little trouble.  He should fully understand these commands. If he doesn't, you can grab a lunge whip and as you go from walk to trot drag the whip behind them. If they don't respond to that, you can lightly tap them on the rump with the whip. Do not hit the horse at any time. When you are showing your horse in a show-driving competition, you will have to use a whip as a traditional item. If your horse doesn't stand still, it may be a good time to take the harness off and lunge them in a roundpen while using voice commands as they transition from walk to trot, trot to walk, stopping, etc. Once your horse understands this, then you will be able to move to ground driving.  During ground driving, you walk behind the horse and teach him to respond to your (gentle) tugs on the reins and voice commands. To do this, have him walk toward a fence, as he prepares to stop, gently pull on both reins and tell him "whoa", or gently pull on one rein to encourage him to turn. Most horses get the message fairly quickly.  He should be especially well-trained to stop at "whoa" and to stand perfectly still at "stand". Your horse shouldn't turn his head as he is turning, even though this is an indication that he's paying attention to you rather than what's going on outside of his periphery. Blinders can help him focus on looking straight ahead when performing this step.  Pull it around him so that he can hear the noise it makes and see it moving. Let him smell of it and become completely familiar with it. As your are ground driving, ask someone to pull the cart between you and your horse on both sides and in front of your horse. Put the horse between the shafts (but do not hitch) and lead the horse while one or two helpers walk the cart to keep pace with the horse. You might even let him watch another horse pulling a cart.  One person will need to hold the horse and comfort him (as well as have control of his head) while you hitch him up. Then lead him while he has the cart hitched to him. Do not get into the cart until you can walk him around without him getting panicky about a cart following so closely behind. Go through your commands with your horse before you feel absolutely certain your horse is ready to be truly driven, with you sitting in the cart has he pulls you and the cart along. You must be absolutely certain that your horse is ready; if you have any doubt, you may compromise the safety of both you and your horse.  Once you have repeated the previous lesson as many times as necessary, you can step into the cart. Be sure you are wearing a helmet, and always have a friend nearby in case assistance is needed. First time must be slow, at walking pace, and preferably on a flat, level surface such as in a riding arena.  Now, you can step it up to pleasure drives on back roads. Somewhere safe without much traffic is all you need.  15-20 minutes of solid driving is about all a beginning young horse can handle per lesson. Be sure to reward lavishly, and of course, have fun!  

let the young horse see new sights.  dress your horse in soft blankets or parts of the harness.  bit the horse as you would when breaking for saddle but use a driving bit.  walk him around in the harness for a while to get used to it.  lunge the horse in the harness and practice giving him voice commands to "walk", "trot", and "whoa".  attach long reins or lines to the horse's bit and begin to "ground drive" him.  ground drive the horse until you are confident that he understands what you want him to do.  spend some time letting your horse get used to the cart for added safety.  with the help of a friend or two, one day quietly hitch the horse to the cart.  step into the cart while your horse pulls it.  repeat until both you and your horse are confident with this arrangement.  keep these lessons short and interesting. 

 If you want to meet new people without being creepy, the first thing you have to do is stop worrying about how you come off and to enjoy the present moment of the new conversation. Let go of your expectations, ego, and fears, all of which can prevent a conversation from unfolding organically. Learn to focus on the other person so that you can drown out your inner nag and stop being distracted from interesting points of discussion and exploration.   When you approach a new person, don't ask yourself, "How do I look?" or "How do I sound?" Instead, ask, "What would this person like to talk about?" "What matters to this person?" You can keep the momentum going by being one step ahead of the person you're talking to by thinking about what to say next, instead of falling behind and obsessing over something you said or did five minutes ago that might have come off the wrong way.; , Neediness is a precursor to obsessiveness, and obsessiveness is creepy. Needy people are imbalanced and unstable because their happiness hinges too greatly on someone else. If you're projecting a vibe that you'll be devastated if a person doesn't want to be your friend or romantic partner, it's time to slow down, be patient, and examine yourself.   If you really click with someone you meet, don't be too quick to say, "I like you!" or "You're really awesome!" unless you're getting a really positive vibe from the other person. Whether you're meeting a potential friend or romantic partner, don't ask for the person's number in the middle or the conversation or as soon as you think you click. Instead, wait until the end to ask -- it's a more natural time to ask. If you meet someone who you think will be a great friend, you can casually say, "We should check out that new movie together," or "I'd love to check out that yoga class you're talking about" -- don't invite the person to do anything too intense at first. Don't ask the person to go out on a long hike with you, go to a family dinner with you, or to help you go underwear shopping. Keep it casual at first, or you'll look too eager. Avoid sounding creepy or desperate by not saying things like, "I don't have many friends -- it would be great to hang out with you!"  , You may be doubting yourself, but you'll be much more likely to come off as not creepy if you keep up your confidence and make other people feel that you're a person who is worth talking to. You should be confident before you walk into a room with new people in it and build your confidence as the conversation goes along. Just smile, talk about the things that you love, and show everyone that you love who you are, where you are, and what you do.   Body language can help you stay confident. Stand tall, maintain eye contact, and don't fidget with your hands or look at the floor. Don't check your reflection in your mirror or in reflective surfaces, or people will see that you're doubting yourself. When you introduce yourself, speak clearly and loudly enough that you'll be heard.  Maintaining a positive attitude -- without seeming too excited -- will make people want to talk to you. You should smile or laugh from time to time without keeping a creepy grin plastered on your face or laughing at things that aren't funny. Talk about the things you love, the things that make you happy, and your interests (as long as they aren't too off-putting at first -- avoid mentioning taxidermy or Facebook stalking on your first go-around) to keep people engaged.   If you talk about your long-standing hatred for a certain teacher, classmate, or celebrity, then yeah, you will come off as creepy. Don't nod and agree with what the person is saying every five seconds like a little lap dog -- that will definitely be creepy. The occasional, "That's so true!" or "I know exactly what you mean!" will be far more positive and far less creepy.  

live in the moment.  don't be needy.  stay confident.  be positive. 

 Colour the parts of the clock handout. Each student can can decorate it any way they like.; , This means the circle and the arrows.  Don’t use too much glue, just enough to ensure that the paper is attached.  First, join the minute hand, then attach the hour hand to the drawing pin. Second, attach the drawing pin with the arrows to the paper plate in the circle. Be sure you can move the clock hands freely.  From the number 12 down to the number 1, draw 4 lines, then from 1 to 2, the other four lines, and so on between the numbers.  Draw a line towards each number that indicates the hour. So, in number 12, draw a line and the number 0. In the number 1, draw a line and the number 5, then in the number 2, draw the number 10 and so on. , Divide the class into groups. For instance, you can divide the class into five groups of students if there are forty of them. Each group will have a chance to say and show a time.  What time does she get up? Camila watches TV at 4:50 after doing her homework. What time does she watch TV? Lucy has lunch at 1:50. What time does she have lunch?  , Meanwhile, the other students have to write their own answer down on paper. If the student is right, the group will win a point. Make at least three rounds. Give some sweets to all of your students at the end of the game, telling them "well done!".  Then you can check that their answers are correct, letting you know how much learning is still needed.   

use this image to print off the clock handouts for each clock being made.  cut out the parts of the clock handout.  stick the circle into the paper plate.  attach the arrows with a drawing pin.  draw lines to represent the minutes.  write the minutes on the edge of the paper plate.  keep on decorating as much as wanted.  ,  ask the students to play a game.  ask the children questions such as:  ana usually gets up at 6 o'clock.  ask your students to indicate the time, using their own clocks.  ask students to hand their papers in to you. 

 Measure the inside surface of the cabinet, by first laying a straight-edge face flat on the bottom shelf of the cabinet with one end of the straight-edge sticking out of the cabinet a few inches.   Slowly close the cabinet door until it is lightly touching the straight-edge. Mark a pencil mark on the door where it touches the straight-edge. Move the straight-edge over at least a couple of inches and make a second mark.; , Now, place your straight-edge on the bottom shelf with its face against the vertical stile (vertical piece of the face frame) opposite the hinged edge of the door.   As before, it should stick out a few inches. Hold it as parallel with the side of the cabinet as possible so it’s close to 90 degrees to the face frame of the cabinet. Again, slowly close the door until it just touches the straight-edge. Mark a pencil mark on the door where it touches the straight edge. Raise the straight-edge at least a few inches and make a second mark.  From the pencil mark near the bottom of the door, use that measurement and make a pencil mark at that point near the top of the door, then make a second one a few inches apart from the first one.   You should now have two marks near the bottom of the door, two near the top, and two along the opened edge of the door.  Create new reference marks by measuring up ½” from the bottom marks, ½” down from the top marks, and ½” in toward the center of the door from the vertical edge marks.   From the new reference marks you just made, line them up with a straight-edge and connect them with a pencil line. Do this along all three edges. These lines represent the size of your piece of sheet metal.  Measure the spaces between your reference marks be sure you stay BETWEEN the hinges and the outer line on the door.   By taking these measurements once, you have established the vertical measurement for all the cabinets of the same height in your kitchen. For cabinets of different widths, measure from the outer edge of the “model” door to the vertical pencil line. Measure that same distance on the other doors and make your reference points. This process will prevent the sheet metal from contacting the face frame of the cabinet. For frameless cabinets, you can use the straight-edge easily at the top, bottom and side without the encumbrance of a face frame. Always remember to measure between the hinge location inside the door and the outer reference line so your sheet metal does not touch the hinges! If the cabinet door has a separate panel within a frame, you can cut the metal to fit the size of the panel (inside surface of the panel) without doing all the measuring and marking. Do not make the sheet metal larger than the panel, or the metal will not attach flatly to the inside of the door.  

lay a straight edge on the bottom shelf of the cabinet.  move the straight-edge on to the bottom shelf.  measure the actual height of the cabinet opening (from the surface of the bottom shelf).  make new reference marks.  take measurements from between your reference marks. 

 If you have a legitimate complaint against the carrier, and you’ve had no success dealing with the various levels of customer service, you can always take your gripe online. Obviously, the more Facebook or Twitter followers you have, the better. And don’t hesitate to encourage your readers to re-post what you’ve written.  Mention the carrier in the hashtag to your posts. You want to make sure that the carrier is specifically referenced, so that other dissatisfied customers of the company can find your posts more easily.  If you find that your posts are getting a lot of views, you might want to consider contacting your carrier’s customer service department again, to let them know of the success of your campaign. They’d really prefer not to have their company’s public relations crisis management team get involved in the dispute if at all possible. That might be enough for them to let you go without a fight. 

air your grievances on social media sites.  use appropriate hashtags.  notify customer service if you’re getting significant activity. 

 The bright light from the beam can temporarily blind or distract the operator of the vehicle. This is extremely dangerous to all of the passengers on board. A laser beam in an airplane cockpit is not just a continuous beam, but appears as a flash that is very distracting.It is actually illegal to aim laser pointers at planes and you can be arrested for it.  At these types of events there are large crowds of people and you can’t be sure that your beam will not end up in someone’s eyes. Aiming the beam at the stage or at a player on the field is annoying both for other viewers and for the players themselves.If you have no specific need for the laser pointer, leave it at home.  Just as you shouldn’t point the laser beam at a person, you should never point it at an animal either. Animals have very similar eyes to ours and they can be harmed by the beam. In addition, you can frighten or confuse the animal by accidentally flash blinding them with the bright light.If you see someone aiming a laser pointer at an animal, gently let them know that this is unsafe.  Most laser pointers are not powerful enough (5 mW) to actually damage your skin, but it’s best if you don’t shine the laser on your skin. Stronger lasers (500 mW) can actually burn your skin if you shine them for too long. It is safe to test that the pointer is working by briefly shining it into your hand.  

never aim a laser pointer at planes, trains, boats, or automobiles.  do not bring laser pointers to concerts or sporting events.  never point the laser pointer at animals.  avoid skin contact for prolonged periods of time. 

 In this initial stage, you will be looking at how you will implement a project and from where you will get relevant data.; , In writing a medical research proposal, experts recommend starting with an abstract that is informed by well-thought-out ideas on comprehensive planning for the research project. This includes proposed methods, overall study design, logistics, a schedule or timeline and other aspects of what you will be doing if the project is approved.  Using the word "problem" in the context of a medical research proposal is not quite like the common use of the opposite words "problem" and "solution." Here, the problem defines the existing situation or general scenario, where goals and objectives seek to use research to illuminate a particular medical phenomenon or general scientific reality.  Develop all of these ideas and use a good comprehensive approach to blend all of the above into one single proposal.   Take advantage of a good format. The style and format of your medical research proposal is crucial to its success. Take a look at what others have done to guide you in the creation of your own proposal. Use white space and create concrete elements of your proposal. Experts recommend using labeled elements like an introduction, plan, method module and conclusion in order to make your medical research proposal look good, and to keep all of the appropriate data in the right places. Approach your document with a concern for style. Many experts who advise individuals on writing these documents recommend keeping the vocabulary reasonably clear and avoiding wordy, vague sentences that may confuse the reader. Also keep an eye out for good transitional elements to make your research proposal flow smoothly.  With a draft of the medical research proposal in hand, go back over the document and read through it to determine its overall effectiveness.   Look for internal consistency. In order to be fairly successful, your medical research proposal should be coherent, and the ideas that are presented should be presented clearly and consistently throughout each element.  One thing that helps a research proposal succeed is its originality from prior research and existing projects. Make sure that yours has an angle that will appeal to those who are in authority to approve projects.  

collect source material and potential project sources.  develop a plan.  identify the problem and the goals.  start writing.  evaluate your rough draft.  assess your plan for originality. 

 If refinancing isn't an option, you may be eligible for pre-paying your loan. Pre-payment, also called early loan payoff, simply means that you pay off your debt before the agreed-upon end date of an existing loan.The benefit of pre-paying your loan is that you're not subjected to the monthly finance charges you would otherwise be paying on your loan, but for that reason many lenders charge a pre-payment penalty or fee.The terms of your existing loan should specify whether there is any pre-payment or early loan payoff penalty, but if you're unsure you can always consult with your lender.  If your lender permits you to make pre-payments on your loan, there may be a special process for making those payments. These payments are sometimes referred to as principal-only payments, and it's important to specify to your lender that you intend for that payment to be applied to the principal loan, not the finance charges for upcoming months. Each lender's process may be different, so it's best to call or email the lender's customer service department and ask what you need to do to make a principal-only payment towards your loan., There are many early loan payoff "calculators" available online, but all of them factor in the same basic information to determine how much you will need to pay in order to payoff your loan early:   the total number of months in your existing loan termthe number of months remaining on your existing loanthe amount your existing loan was forthe monthly payments remaining on your loanthe current annual interest rate (APR) on your existing loan 

learn whether you're able to pre-pay your loan.  learn the pre-payment process for your lender.  calculate your early loan payoff amount.

 You can use any kind of thicker fillet (salmon, halibut, bass, snapper etc.) Or you can use a cleaned and scaled whole fish. Lay your fish in a lightly oiled glass dish with a lid.If you are working with several fillets, you can overlap them in the dish.; , If you'd like, you can start an easy side to cook while your fish is cooking in the microwave. Put some rice in a rice cooker and turn it on. Try basmati or jasmine rice. Or, get your water boiling for couscous. Try salting the couscous water and adding a little butter or oil.  Here comes the fun part. What kind of flavor are you craving? You can easily season your fish with any of the recommendations below, or create your own seasoning. Don't worry about basting the fish perfectly, just glob your seasoning on!   A few dashes of coconut milk, cloves, a clove of diced garlic, fresh or dried basil, cilantro, sliced chives, and lemon juice. Lemon or limejuice, sliced green onion, garlic, salt, and pepper. A pinch of ground cumin, a clove of diced garlic, sliced sweet onion, cilantro, salt, and pepper. A splash of soy sauce, a splash of sesame oil, grated ginger, a dash of rice wine, and sesame seeds.  Cover your dish with a lid and place it in the microwave for 4-5 minutes depending on the thickness of your fillets.   Use a fork to carefully test the doneness of your fish by gently flaking away at the meat. If the meat is white (or barely opaque) and flakes easily, the fish is done.  Combine your fish with a side of rice, couscous, salad, or whatever you prefer, and enjoy!  

prepare your fish.  prepare a side to go with your fish (optional).  season your fish.  microwave your fish.  serve your meal. 

 Volunteer, practice random acts of kindness, and be generous. The act of giving always makes the heart more content with its self. Peace and selfishness do not coexist very well.; , Don't be too hard on yourself. No one is perfect. Love yourself and love life in all its forms. Be open to accept things in a positive manner.  Remain cool and calm as a person. Ignore the negativity (negative comments, happenings, people) around you.Be understanding: many times hard feelings exist due to not understanding the other person's point of view. When you start putting yourself in the person's place you begin to understand why he says what he says and you start breaking the wall of ego.  Be friendly and helpful. Being friendly does not mean you have to bring home everyone you meet, but you can always put up a good front and behave warmly in front of others. When you give positive vibes, you will attract positive vibes.  Do not enter into an argument for silly things. Nothing is worth fighting over and you cannot change other people. Remember these two rules before picking up a fight. It's not worth it after all.  Keep yourself busy with something constructive. But do keep some time for relaxation too.  Always. Take lessons from the events in your life. Turn disappointments into life lessons. Explore courses in sustainable happiness and positive psychology.  Try not to compare yourself with others. Everyone is unique in this world. Cherish the fact and feel nice about yourself. You have everything including a nice heart.  Remember that your body will experience the harmful effects of keeping anger and hatred inside you. If you forgive you will be able to forget. Forgiving may not be easy but it brings you tremendous peace. Forgive for your sake, if not theirs.  Be honest with yourself and what you want, and what you expect from yourself and others. It is not easy at first. If you know what you really want, then you could achieve your goals easier.  Being calm keeps a person from making hasty decisions. Once something is said or done, it cannot be taken back. It takes practice, so hang in there.  You are only in your head. You never know what someone else is thinking or what they meant by their comment. Ask questions if you want to be sure.  Rarely anything anyone does is about you. It is based on their own dreams and desires. You never know how someone else's life is going.  True happiness can only be found when you stop worrying about yourself and try to look out for those around you. Helping family members, co-workers, and friends can give your life meaning and joy. Selfishness, on the other hand, will only provide temporary pleasure. Obviously there are some aspects of life where you must focus on yourself, like your body's need for food and sleep, but only focusing on your own needs will never result in true, sustainable happiness.  Smiling is infectious. If you make yourself smile for a minute, you are using all kinds of facial muscles, and you can't help but feel good.  If you can accomplish even the smallest goal, it will pave the way for bigger and better things. With goals accomplished, it sends a message to yourself, that you are a winner, and can do what ever you set your mind to.  You are unique and special in all the world. If life knocks you down get back up. Failing is not in getting knocked down, it is in staying down.  Choose your own way of life without being pressured by anyone else. As an example of this, Barrack Obama was born to a Muslim father, but chose to be a Christian and Nobel prize winner Bertrand Russel, a great advocate of peace, chose to be an atheist. ,,,, Comparing your life against others or your past creates a lot of unhappiness, enjoy and make the most of what you have. Don't compare. Comparing your life against others or your past creates a lot of unhappiness, enjoy and make the most of what you have.  When you experience a thought nagging at the back of your mind, write it down as a question. This focuses your mind and helps you not become obsessed with your thoughts.  Don't worry about the past and the future. contentment is reached when you make the most of the present as thinking of the past and the future will in the end just lead to disappointment.  This does not have to be a religious practice, the intention is to give time for your worries to come up, but don't think about them just allow them to naturally pass until you achieve a calm mind. meditation is allowing your mind to become calm. You don't have to spend hours doing this 20 minutes is fine.  Getting up early helps you avoid feeling rushed and you can relax before you go to work.  A lot of us do what we think we should do and this is often influence by what we think others think we should do. Instead follow your instincts and do what you feel is right., 

be generous.  love yourself.  ignore negative comments.  be friendly.  never argue.  stay busy.  think positive.  be yourself.  forgive and forget.  be honest.  stay calm.  making assumptions can be painful.  remember not to take things personally.  give service to others.  smile.  do, not try.  never, ever, give up!,  always be true to yourself.  know that by being truthful and positive and by helping others, you can have more.  ,cherish the values of love generosity courage, compassion and kindness in their own right as being worthy of getting you closer to happiness,  ,be simply good it is advantageous to you as an individual , and to the human species as a whole and remember the words of confucius' truth and sincerity is the basis of all virtue'  ,have a purpose in life and here i quote a is the meaning and purpose of life , the whole aim and end of human existence'  ,  don't compare.  ask questions.  be in the moment.  meditate.  get up early.  do what you feel you should do and not what you think.   

 Do not take larger or smaller amounts of the drug, and do not take it for any longer than what the doctor has prescribed. Make sure that you carefully read the instructions on the prescription label before you begin taking the drug.; , Cephalexin capsules or tablets should be taken with a full glass of water. Other drinks may affect the effectiveness of the drug.If you are taking the capsule or tablet form, do not chew or try to dissolve it in your mouth. It should be swallowed whole along with the water., When using the dissolvable tablet, never chew or swallow the tablet. Dissolvable tablets are designed to be combined with liquid before taking the medicine so that the medicine will be metabolized faster by the body.   Dissolve the drug in 2 teaspoons of water. Stir the mixture until it is fully dissolved. Drink the solution immediately.To ensure that you have taken the entire dose, add water to the glass and swirl gently to collect remaining drug, then drink the water.  Follow your doctor’s instructions for taking liquid Cephalexin. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions. If you are using the oral suspension liquid form of Cephalexin, you will need to shake the container before use.It is also crucial that you take the correct dose by using a measuring cup or spoon. Often the dose is given in milliliters (ml), so a medicine syringe (without a needle) is commonly used to measure the dose. If you do not have a measuring device, ask a pharmacist for one.  Remaining Cephalexin drugs should be stored properly. Store the drug in a cool, dry place with temperatures not exceeding 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius). Do not store this drug in the bathroom because the moisture may affect the quality of the tablets or capsules.   Liquid Cephalexin should be stored in the refrigerator. Do not freeze this medication. Throw away any unused medicine after 14 days., Cephalexin may cause an upset stomach if taken without food. To prevent an upset stomach, take Cephalexin with a meal, a snack, or at least a glass of milk. If you still experience an upset stomach when taking Cephalexin with food or if the upset stomach is severe, talk to your doctor about it., However, if there is 1 to 2 hours left for the next dose, just skip the missed dose altogether and wait for the next scheduled time.   Never try to take double dose just to make up for the missed dose. This may lead to overdose and adverse side effects., This drug is known as bactericidal, which means that its primary mode of action is to inhibit or disrupt the bacteria’s cell wall and cause it to burst or rupture.Cephalexin is effective against gram positive bacteria. These bacteria include bacillus, corynebacterium, clostridium, listeria, staphylococcus and streptococcus.Cephalexin does not exhibit any therapeutic effect on viral infection. It is also not used to treat methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)., Cephalexin is primarily used against bacterial infection. Bacterial infections may include bone and joint infections, pneumonia, skin, urinary tract and middle ear infection.   In some cases, Cephalexin serves as a prophylactic drug - meaning, it is used to prevent certain infections. For example, this drug is used to prevent bacterial endocarditis., Taking Cephalexin when you do not have a bacterial infection may reduce the effectiveness of antibiotics when you really need them. Cephalexin may also be less effective if you do not take the full dose or cycle that your doctor has prescribed.Talk to your doctor if you still have symptoms of infection after taking all of your medication., Do not use Cephalexin if you are allergic to it. In most cases, if you have a known allergy to Cephalexin, you probably will also be allergic to other cephalosporin antibiotics.Some of the examples of cephalosporin are cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefdinir, cefditoren, cefixime, cefprozil, ceftazidime, and cefuroxime. If you notice, cephalosporin drugs start with ‘cef’. Remember this and you will be better prepared to avoid this drug. Also tell your doctor if you are allergic to penicillin or amoxicillin. You may have a higher chance of being allergic to cephalexin., You should not take Cephalexin if you have certain underlying conditions. Some medical conditions or diseases may also stop you from taking Cephalexin. These diseases may include kidney and liver disease, colitis, diabetes and malnutrition. Most of these diseases alter your body’s ability to metabolize Cephalexin.   For example, Cephalexin contains sugar, so you might not want to take it if you have diabetes., There have not been many studies about the effects of Cephalexin on unborn babies. Therefore, it is best to discuss alternative options with your physician if you are pregnant. Cephalexin should only be taken by pregnant women if there is no other choice., If you are taking any other drugs aside from Cephalexin, let your doctor know about it. There is a chance for drug interaction – meaning taking another drug may affect the effectiveness of Cephalexin.   For example, some vaccines that contain bacteria such as typhoid and BCG may be affected by Cephalexin. In addition, some studies show that Cephalexin can interfere with the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. So if you are taking Cephalexin while taking pills, you might get pregnant.Other drugs that may interact with Cephalexin are Coumadin, metformin and probenecid., Certain herbal medicines may interfere with the effectiveness of Cephalexin, so it's important to inform your doctor of any herbal medicines or supplements that you are currently taking., If you feel like there is a reason that you shouldn't take Cephalexin, it's a good idea to tell your doctor. Your doctor may either reduce the dose or switch you to a different drug entirely.   Special tests, such as a skin test, can also be done to determine if you can safely take the drug. , It is crucial to talk to your doctor before taking the drug. Your doctor will be able to give you comprehensive and accurate instructions pertaining to the proper use of the medication. Never attempt to self-prescribe Cephalexin or take someone else’s medication., Cephalexin has some common side effects, that should be mild and short-lived. If these side effects become unmanageable or severe, notify your doctor. These side effects include:   upset stomach diarrhea vomiting mild skin rashes  , When taking Cephalexin, you should call your doctor right away if you experience any serious side effects. You or your doctor may file a report with the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online at http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch or by phone at 1-800-332-1088. These serious side effects that you should watch for include:difficulty breathing or swallowing unusual bleeding and bruising sore throat vaginal infection wheezing hives severe skin rash itching painful mouth and throat sores diarrhea that is severe, or with blood or mucus dark colored or decreased urine fever pale or yellow skin  

follow your doctor's instructions for taking cephalexin.  drink water with your cephalexin capsules or tablets.  use water to dissolve tablets if taking the dissolvable form of cephalexin.  take liquid cephalexin as directed by your doctor.  store cephalexin in a cool, dry place.  have some food or a glass of milk when you take cephalexin.  take any missed doses of cephalexin as soon as you remember.  understand that cephalexin is used to combat bacteria within the body.  take cephalexin to combat bacterial infection.  be aware that improper use of cephalexin may reduce its effectiveness.  tell your doctor about any allergies that you have.  make sure your doctor is aware of any underlying conditions you have.  inform your doctor if you are pregnant.  make your doctor aware of any other medications you're currently taking.  tell your doctor if you are taking any herbal medicines.  let your doctor know if you don't think cephalexin is a good choice for you.  talk to your doctor before taking the drug.  notify your doctor if you experience any severe or persistent side effects.  see your doctor immediately if you experience any serious side effects or symptoms of a possible allergic reaction. 

 It is important to research your transfer(s). Prior to beginning this process you should learn the following: Does a transfer pathway already exist for these credits? Many institutions have designated transfer pathways between specific programs. For example: if you're using a Police Foundations diploma as leverage to complete your Criminology degree, many universities have likely already created a seamless transfer pathway for students completing this traditional transfer.  This will be critical. Some institutions are more likely to accept transfer credits than others, same goes with individual programs. Do your research - it can save you (more) time and money.  Each program generally publicizes the required courses. If this is not publicly available, contact their faculty and request a copy of the requirements. Faculty's contact information should be included on the website.  This is a critical step in the process. It is important you compare your completed credits to those required in the program you're applying to. Determine if you're able to transfer any 'core credits' or if you're simply transferring credits that will be applied as electives or general education credits., Once you've determined where and which credits you're planning to transfer, you will require the documents that prove your educational experience. You will require an 'official' transcript as part of the evaluation process. You will have to request this document from your previous institution, whether over the phone, online or in-person. Typically the Registrars or Admissions office will be responsible for this information.   It would be wise to ask for two copies, one for you and one for the institution you are transferring into. In order for the document to be official it must be sealed, only open one copy (this is why asking for two is wise). It should be noted that some schools will charge a fee for processing the transcript while others will do it at no charge.  Course outlines (also known as a course syllabus) are the contract between a professor and their students. They detail the learning outcomes for any student who successfully completes their course. These outlines are the specific details that will be used to evaluate your actual credits. Focus on retrieving outlines for the courses you believe will transfer, but if possible provide the advisor with ALL your course outlines - you never know which credits will surprisingly transfer over, even if as electives.  Find out who is responsible for transfer credit evaluations. Typically, you will work with an academic advisor who initiates the process on your behalf but senior faculty members are usually involved in the process as well., This is your moment, this meeting will officially begin the process of transferring credits from one institution to another. Prior to the meeting, ask what you should bring with you (remember this set of instructions is general and each school may require additional items, or less items), This process will vary depending on the amount of transfer credits and which institution is processing the request. It can range anywhere from immediately to weeks. If you are going through this process during peak season (typically July - September) you will likely experience a longer wait time.  It is important to establish this during your meeting. Institutions have different processes for transfer credits., Find out how your credits transfer. Some schools will block enroll you into a schedule, in this case it will be your responsibility to drop the individual courses which you've already received credit for. Other schools require you to create your own schedule, you should be equally as careful to not duplicate any courses that are unnecessary., This may help a future student transfer their credits more seamlessly, or even create a new pathway., Your work load just got a bit lighter!  

research your transfer pathway.  decide which institution, and specifically which program, you're interested in transferring credits to.  determine which credits are required in the program you've selected.  identify which credits you will be transferring.  request your official transcript.  gather your course outlines.  request a meeting with an academic advisor, or faculty.  provide the academic advisor/faculty member with your transcript(s) and course outline(s).  be patient.  follow up on your transfer.  drop necessary courses, if applicable.  share your experience with faculty and administration at your previous institution.  if your credits have successfully been evaluated, you will now be a few steps closer to graduation. 

 Whenever possible, purchase shower products that come in non-breakable containers. This will help eliminate the risk of accidents., Many products, including shampoos, body washes, and lotions come in containers that have pump dispensers rather than tops that twist off or pop open. Not only are these convenient, they will also help you avoid spills. Choose products with pump dispensers whenever possible., You can also rely on your sense of touch to help you select the right materials to use in the shower. For instance, you can use one cloth for washing your face, and select a cloth with a contrasting texture to use for washing your body. Likewise, if your shampoo and conditioner bottles are the same size and shape, place a rubber band around one of them so you can tell them apart. 

choose plastic containers and materials.  use products with pump dispensers.  use tactile aids. 

 You can make one meal in bulk and measure out portion sizes into mason jars to eat later in the week. They’re also freezable, so you can store food for longer periods of time. If you’re packing dinner to transport elsewhere, mason jars offer an elegant and portable presentation option., Since they’re already so gorgeous, those lunch salads will present beautifully for dinner. You can make them heartier by going with the optional protein choices, like adding the baked or grilled chicken. You can also substitute chicken for grilled shrimp or salmon to dress your salads up for dinner., Curry and rice will pack some robust flavors into your mason jar dinner. To make the curry, simmer the chicken, salsa, and curry powder or garam masala in a large skillet covered with a fitted lid over low heat for 30 minutes. Then remove the pan from heat and stir in the low- or non-fat yogurt and use two forks to shred the simmered chicken.Then divide 1/2 cup portions of the pulled chicken in wide mouth pint jars.  Bring the rice, water, and salt to a boil in a large saucepan, then lower the heat and simmer until the rice is tender and has absorbed the water, or 20 to 30 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork and stir in the cilantro and lime juice and zest.Add 3/4 cup of the rice over the chicken in each jar, then top with a lime wedge and cover the jar to store for up to five days or to transport. Make sure the chicken goes in the jar first, so the rice will be less likely to become soggy. To reheat, microwave for 90 seconds, and enjoy dinner from the jar or pour its contents onto a shallow dish.  

make and store dinners for a week or use jars for transport.  switch up protein choices to dress up lunch salads.  make a curry in a hurry.  prepare cilantro lime rice. 

 If your dog has mastitis, there are treatments available to cure it. The most common treatment is antibiotics to kill the bacteria. When the mastitis is too severe, the mammary glands may need to be surgically drained. If the glands get infected often, the dog may have to have their mammary glands removed.If the dog is ill or septic, they may need an IV. You may need to place a warm compress on the swollen glands to help reduce pain and help the milk flow better.  Measures can be taken to prevent mastitis if your dog has just given birth. Make sure to keep your dog and the puppies clean. Trim the hair around the dog's mammary glands and wipe away any dirt, debris, or urine from that area. You should also clean the puppies' litter area.Make sure the puppies don't scratch the mammary glands with their nails. Clip their nails if possible. Make sure each mammary gland is expelling milk. If the puppies aren't using each teat, manually squeeze milk from them to clear bacteria and help milk not to get backed up.  Some risk factors may lead to mastitis in dogs. The condition is most commonly seen in female dogs who are lactating. Trauma to the mammary glands can lead to mastitis. Trauma can come from nursing puppies who bite the teat or scratch it. Trauma may also occur if the dog has short legs and the teats drag along the ground and get scratched or damaged.Poor hygiene around the mammary glands may also cause the bacterial infection. It may also occur due to the infection spreading through the blood.  Mastitis is an infection of the mammary glands caused by bacteria. It leads to inflammation. The infection usually starts at the opening of the teat. It can occur in one or multiple mammary glands. It generally affects female dogs who have already given birth and who are lactating.The infection is not common.  

treat mastitis.  prevent mastitis.  identify the risk factors.  know what mastitis is. 

 On your palette or painting surface, place a small dab of Ultramarine blue. Blue should make up roughly half of the total paint, so use as much as you need for what you want to paint., Don’t apply the two colors to the exact same spot. Rather, place them a half inch or one centimeter apart. Then gently swirl the two colors together. Adjust with a little more of either color to make the black you want.  if you want to deepen and darken the black you’ve mixed, add just a small dab of Prussian Blue. This new mixture works great for a black that shows the darkness of night.         

start with ultramarine blue.  place a touch of burnt umber near the blue.  add a dab of prussian blue. 

 Take two colours of thread and fill two shuttles with the light colour and two with the dark.; , Make 24 double and 12 picots, 6 of them short and 6 long.

 One person needs to be “the computer.” In other words, s/he needs to set up the game. In most of the games, it’ll be you, since you’ll be the one who’s read the article.; , Then make an 9 by 9 grid on each sheet.  Do the same on the other grid.  That selection should be arranged like an even bigger square. Copy the arrangement onto your friend’s grid in the same place. Make sure that the letters and numbers correspond.  This will now be the cheat sheet. Place 8-10 Xs (or “mines”) on your grid, making sure that none of them are inside the 4 by 4 arrangement.   Surrounding each X should be 3, 5 or 8 squares. Any mines in the corner will be surrounded by 3 squares, any mines bordering the edge of the grid will be surrounded by 5 squares, and all other mines will be surrounded by 8 squares. We will call these squares ‘’’border squares.’’’  , Figure out how many mines are surrounding the border square. The answer will be written as a number on the border square.  To make sure you’ve filled them all in, just look at how many border squares are labeled around each mine. If a mine has only 7 labeled border squares, you probably missed one.  

pick the 'computer'.  assuming you’re the computer, you should take a piece of paper and tear it in half.  label the columns of your grid a-i and the rows 1-9.  have your friend outline a 4 by 4 arrangement of squares on your grid.  cover your own grid from view.  pick a border square.  do the same thing on every border square. 

 Eating healthy is really important if you want to be a healthy teen. You don't need to go on a diet, just pay attention to what you're putting in your body.   If you only ever eat sugary breakfast cereals and candy bars you aren't going to be healthy. Depending on your body and what works best for you, you can eat three meals a day or 5-6 mini-meals a day. NEVER skip meals. Try healthy alternatives, instead of having a bowl of ice-cream, opt for a frozen yogurt. Or try having apple slices instead of potato chips. Drink more water. This is basically the most important thing of all. If you drink more water you will be much healthier. It flushes the toxins out of your body and gives your skin a healthy glow. It also keeps your skin hydrated and helps prevent spots. It also helps if you have acne. As a general rule of thumb, try to drink a lot to the point where your urine is almost completely clear.; , Whether it's walking in the park, or doing a couple of crunches do at least 20 minutes of physical activity several times a week.   You should not exercise every day, when you work out you break your muscles down. It's the rebuilding that makes them stronger. If you don't give them time to rebuild, you're going to seriously hurt yourself. Exercise will make you stronger and tone your muscles. You can go to the gym and swim or run on the treadmill, buy a few work out DVDs, or just go for a jog around the block. Whatever it is, exercising will make you healthier and happier about your body. It also reduces stress and helps to calm the mind!  , During puberty you'll find you need more sleep than you did when you were younger. Sure it's tempting to stay up late chatting with friends on the phone or computer, but the next morning you'll be miserable   You need to get a minimum of 8 hours of sleep every single night. To find out how many hours you personally should be sleeping, on a weekend go to bed at the time you do on a school night and don't set your alarm. When you wake up count how many hours you were asleep and get that many hours every night. It may be tough if you get back late and have to wake up early on a normal school day, but if you put the extra effort in of an early night you will feel much more refreshed the next morning. This will aid your concentration and you will be in a much happier and friendly mood.  

start eating healthier.  start exercising more.  catch up on your sleep. 

 You may want to apply a nail hardener to help strengthen and protect your nails while they grow.Nail hardeners will help to prevent chips and breaks that force you to trim your nails back before they reach the desired length.          Remember, your nails will only be harder while the nail hardener is on them. Once it wears off your nails will return to their normal strength. Reapply the nail hardener daily to keep your nails strong. Nail hardener should be used only as a temporary supplement to a more long-term nail health plan in which you improve the nail’s natural strength.; , In addition to applying lotion, remember to always wear gloves or mittens when you're outside in the cold. If working with any type of chemicals — from household cleaning products to art supply products — protect your nails with latex or heavy duty work gloves, depending on what the situation calls for. This will help to prevent your nails from breaking.  That, in turn, results in having to trim them back more frequently.   For longer nails, make sure to protect your nails from water by cutting down on exposure — wearing gloves while washing the dishes, for example.  You already probably eat more than enough protein for your body, so unless you're protein-deficient (which, per the average U.S. diet, is highly unlikely), you don't need to add more protein to your diet to grow your nails. In fact, too much protein can cause obesity, accelerate kidney damage, and possibly cause diabetes.   For strong nails, try to eat a wide variety of healthy foods, including fruits, vegetables, lean protein, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products.  Biotin can help to strengthen brittle nails so that they will not break as easily.Taking a biotin supplement may help you to grow your nails longer and faster. Eating foods that contain biotin can also help with growth.You can purchase biotin supplements in drug stores, grocery stores, or health food stores. A common dosage of biotin for adults is 30 micrograms per day. 

apply a nail hardener.  wear gloves to protect against cold weather and chemicals.  protect your nails from prolonged water exposure.letting your nails soak in water for too long — whether you’re doing the dishes or spending a lot of time in the swimming pool — can result in weak nails that have a tendency to split when they grow a little bit of length.  eat a balanced diet.  try taking biotin supplements. 

 To relate to someone requires that you know where this person is coming from, so it is very helpful to learn about the challenges an autistic person faces. They may have trouble reading your emotions, or they might read your emotions but not be sure why you feel that way. In addition to this confusion, sensory issues and introversion are common, so socializing can be tiring. But the sense of a connection with you is still likely very important to them.To learn more about the symptoms and challenges of being autistic, see How to Recognize the Signs of Autism.; , You may see in your friend a tendency to say or do things that are socially inappropriate at the time, such as saying something out loud most people have learned to keep in their heads, getting too close to someone else, or cutting in line.This is because understanding social rules can be difficult for autistic people.   It's okay to explain a social rule or tell them that an action of theirs upset you. For example, "This isn't the back of the line, so we shouldn't cut in here. I see the back of the line over there." Autistic people often have strong senses of fairness, so explaining how a social rule fits into these values may help.Assume that they mean well. Autistic people usually do not mean to be offensive. They don't want to hurt you or anyone else; they just don't understand how to respond.  Autistic people tend to display a variety of atypical behaviors. For example, autistic individuals may:   Echo things someone else said. This is called 'echolalia'. Talk about a topic for a long period of time, without recognizing when others have lost interest. Speak honestly, and sometimes bluntly. Interject with statements that seem irrelevant to the current discussion, such as pointing out a pretty flower. Not respond to their own names.  For many autistic individuals, routines are an important aspect of their lives. Because of this, you can better relate to an autistic person by keeping in mind that routine may matter a great deal to them; you can help this individual by making sure their routine stays on track throughout the day. If you have become part of this person's routine and then break it, it could be very upsetting to your friend. Try to keep in mind their perspective as you interact with him. Keep in mind that just because you may not value routine that much, and so don't care much whether routine is deviated from or not, to them it may be a huge deal if you deviate from routine.  Special interests are similar to a passion in non-autistic people, but are even stronger for an autistic person. Your friend may engage in their special interest(s) often, and love to talk about it. See if their interest area overlaps with yours, and use it as a tool to connect.   Some autistic people have more than one special interest at once.  Every autistic person is different, and so it's important to understand them as a unique person.Difficulty reading tone of voice and body language is typical of autistic people, so they may need extra explanation. Autistic people usually have slightly different body language, including an avoidance of eye contact and frequent stimming (repetitive self-soothing behaviors). Recognize your friend's own personal "normal." Autistic people often have sensory issues. They may react differently, or even adversely, to strong odors (such as tuna), unexpected touches, loud noises, or certain textures (to name a few).  There is a false stereotype about autism, most likely (unintentionally) propagated in part by the movie Rain Man, in which it is thought that most autistic individuals have super-human cognitive abilities (such as the ability to near instantly count how many toothpicks fell on the floor).In fact, such autistic savants are not all that common., On one hand, not seeing the person may lead you to introduce them as "my autistic friend," stereotype them, or treat them like a child. On the other, refusing to acknowledge the disability and not accommodating their needs is also unhelpful. Strike a balance by treating their differences as natural, and overall unremarkable.   Don't tell people that your friend is autistic unless they have given you permission. If they mention a need, accommodate it without making it a big deal. They may be surprised at your graciousness, and they will likely appreciate your being understanding., Autistic people may not pick up hints or cues, so it's best to directly state your feelings.This helps eliminate confusion on both ends, and that way if the autistic person has upset you, they have the opportunity to make amends and learn from it.   "I'm feeling really down about my day at work, and I need some quiet time right now. We can talk later." "Asking Jamal out was really difficult for me, and I was so surprised that he said yes! I can't wait for our date on Friday. Do you want to help me pick out what to wear?"  , Autistic people tend to move, speak, and interact in ways that are slightly offbeat.This is likely true of your friend. If so, keep in mind that it is part of who they are, and if you are going to be their friend, it's important to accept all of them.   If something crosses your boundaries (e.g., playing with your hair in a way that bothers you), or otherwise upsets you, it's always okay to explain how you feel. If they state that they want to look less unusual, you might want to subtly point out when they do something strange. Explain it clearly and without condescension, the way you might tell a new driver how to merge onto a highway.  If your autistic friend is looking to make new friends, then they may be interested in group events. No matter how obvious or subtle their autistic traits are in social settings, you might be surprised at how accepting other people are!, If an autistic person becomes overtaxed, it may end in screaming, crying, or losing the ability to speak. Your friend may not recognize stress cues on their own, so if you notice them becoming agitated, suggest that they take a break.   Help them get to a quiet, peaceful place with less noise and movement. Take them away from crowds and spectators.Ask before touching or grabbing them. For example, "I'd like to take your hand now and lead you outside." You don't want to startle or scare them. Avoid criticizing their behavior. They can't control themselves very well right now, and you don't want to stress them even further. If you're overwhelmed, leave. Ask if they would like a tight hug. Sometimes this helps. Let them relax for a while afterwards. They might want one-on-one time, or want to be alone.  The same rules of respect apply to autistic and non-autistic people: don't grab or move their hands/arms/body without permission, don't take away a toy or object they're busy with, and be considerate in your words and actions. Some people, including adults, feel that disabled people don't need to be treated like real people.   If you see someone else being rude or mean to the autistic person, say something. Encourage your friend to recognize when they are being mistreated, and to stand up for themselves. This can be difficult for autistic people, especially those who have PTSD as a result of compliance therapy or other bad experiences.  Get insight on how to relate to this person by talking with them about what it is like for them in particular to live as an autistic person. You may find that they want to share and can tell you lots of useful information that will help you to relate to them better.A broad question like "What is it like to be autistic?" is too vague, and the autistic person will probably be unable to put such a complicated thing into words. Specific questions, like "How does sensory overload feel?" or "Is there a way I can help when you get too stressed?" are more likely to result in a useful answer. Be sure to do so in a quiet place when you are alone so as not to draw a lot of attention to them. Be sure to speak clearly and genuinely, so the autistic person doesn't misunderstand or think you are teasing.  Stimming refers to self-stimulating behavior and it helps autistic individuals to stay calm or manage emotion. For example, if they start giggling and flapping their hands when they see you, it means they really like you. Try to remember that stimming often helps the person doing it, so unless it's seriously disruptive or invading your personal space, learn to accept it. Try taking deep breaths in and out if you find yourself getting annoyed at the behavior. Stimming may include behaviors such as :   Fidgeting with objects. Rocking. Flapping and fidgeting with hands. Bouncing. Head banging. Squealing. Repeatedly feeling the texture of something, such as hair.  Autistic people are routinely criticized by family members, friends, therapists, bullies, and even strangers, because they act or look different. This can make life very difficult. Work on communicating unconditional acceptance in your words and actions. Remind them that it's okay to be different, and you like them just the way they are.  

recognize the emotional challenges autistic people face.  learn about the social challenges.  learn about the behaviors of autistic individuals.  understand the importance of routine.  recognize the power of special interests.  get to know this person's strengths, differences, and challenges.  rid yourself of stereotypes about autistic individuals.  see both the person and the disability.  be clear about how you feel and what you want.  accept any quirks and oddities, without trying to change them.  try introducing this person to your other friends.  watch for signs of stress, and step in to avoid a meltdown or shutdown.  respect their free will and personal space, and encourage others to do the same.  ask questions about how you can be accommodating and helpful.  avoid stressing out when this person 'stims'.  make it clear that you accept them. 

 If your son is old enough to understand that you need to take a urine sample, it is possible he may be uncomfortable or resistant to providing a sample. Such resistance can cause stress to the child and the parent who is trying to collect the sample, so preparing the child ahead of time can help make the test go smoothly., Tell your son that the test will not hurt or cause him any physical discomfort, and reassure him that you will be there to guide him through the test., For boys, the urine test can be turned into a game, which will make your son more comfortable and perhaps even eager to complete the test correctly.   Tell him to think of the test as target practice. Learning to urinate in the toilet is part of toilet training, so tell him that urinating into the test cup is the same thing. Come up with a fun reward for your son for when he "hits the target" during the urine collection.When the test is for protein in the urine, tell your son that the nurse or doctor will have to dip a special paper strip into the urine for a color test. Ask the doctor or nurse if your son can watch the strip being dipped and have your son guess what color the strip will turn., You can minimize stress for your son and for yourself if you do the following:   Come prepared. Ask when you make your son's doctor's appointment whether a urine sample will be required. This way you can try to avoid having your child urinate right before the appointment. You should also ask if the urine sample must be a "clean catch" (a sterile specimen) so that you can practice having your son wipe with sterile towelettes before the appointment.Explain the test to your son. Telling your son that he will have to provide a urine sample prior to the doctor's appointment and then explaining the test to him in a reassuring, calm manner will also help prepare your son. Explain that even grown-ups collect a sample of urine this way when their doctors ask them to. Assure them this is a normal test and that it is not difficult.Give your son water prior to the test. Encouraging your son to drink plenty of water before your visit to the doctor's office can help him to urinate when it is time to collect the sample.Having an empty bladder and being unable to urinate may cause your son to feel pressured or stressed during the test, so make things easier for him by getting him to drink liquids beforehand. Simplify the test procedure. Ask the doctor's office which supplies they offer to make the collection as easy as possible. A receptacle placed in the toilet, such as a bedpan, can be simpler and more familiar for a child than catching urine in a cup.Follow your doctor's recommendations for how to simplify the test.  

prepare the boy.  reassure the child.  make it a game.  minimize stress. 

 That counts just as much as if everyone else likes it. Have fun choosing your name and love what you end up using.  User names like WakaWaka or Playboy fall flat because everyone already knows them, and that takes all of the fun away. Even names like ILikePie (The most common male user name a couple years ago in my school) just causes them to lose all of their points due to lack of creativity. Also, they're not really fun. Your name should be comical, fun and very clever. That's what gives it intrigue.  People don't like copies. Also don't add random letters or numbers to it, it makes it look uncreative and bad. If your name is taken, think of a new one.  

no matter what your user name is, make sure you like it.  don't use something well known or taken.  make sure the name or anything similar to it isn't taken yet. 

 Don’t regret having spent too much time at work, and not enough time with your friends and family. The people who love and care about you can help to boost your self-confidence and make you feel happier with yourself.Cherish the joys of time with friends, loved ones, and family. Make sure that you have time on the weekends and evenings. If you don’t already, set aside time regularly each week to do something as a family or with your friends. Have more one-on-one time with your spouse, friends, or kids. When you’re with someone one-on-one, that may help to deepen the relationship. You may be able to talk more freely about your interests, thoughts, and feelings. Don’t be afraid to share your worries or concerns with trusted friends and family. Keep close those who love you unconditionally, regardless of your status, career, or money.  You may have been trained to think that the only measure of success is to be respected at your job. Even if your work or life doesn’t exactly go as planned, believe that there are other things out there that are worth living for. See yourself as constantly changing and evolving, rather than static.If things don’t go as you’d planned, be flexible. Imagine what other things might work well for you, or make you happy. Avoid people that make you feel worthless, and focus your time and efforts around those that value you regardless of what you do for a living. Review the positive things that you have done in your life thus far. Be proud of the small or big accomplishments that you have achieved. Write down at least five things that you have done that make you feel happy about who you are.  Cultivate your adventurous and curious spirit. Don’t give up on your dreams, whether it’s to build your own outdoor patio, bake decadent desserts, or do watercolor art. See your life as full of new and interesting surprises.Be confident that you are good enough, smart enough, and capable enough to try new things. Consider taking classes at a local university or community college. Join a club that has common interests, such as an outdoors club, a language group, or a knitting group.  

connect more with your friends and family.  avoid feeling shame if things don't measure up to expectations.  develop new skills or interests beyond work. 

 If your battleships are touching, there is a chance that your opponent may sink two ships back to back. To reduce your opponent’s chances of finding a second battleship after hitting one, some players suggest spacing your battleships out so that they do not touch. Try to keep one or two spaces between each of your battleships to reduce the chances of your opponent finding one of your battleships., Even though having your battleships right next to each other is seen as a weakness by some players, other players see this as a potential strategy. By placing two ships so that they are touching, but not overlapping, you may be able to confuse your opponent about the type of ship they have just sunk.Keep in mind that placing ships close together can work in your favor, but it can also be a risky strategy since it may lead to your opponent discovering one or more of your other ships.  If you play with the same opponent often, another way that you can improve your chances of winning is to place ships where your opponent seldom strikes. Keep a mental record of the spaces your opponent strikes most often and avoid these zones.For example, does your opponent tend to start their strikes on the right side of the board, to the center or in the lower left corner? Identify your opponent’s most common strike areas and avoid placing your ships in these zones.  

space ships out so that they do not touch.  try placing ships so that they touch, but do not overlap.  pay attention to your opponent’s moves. 

 Drinking water serves a two-fold purpose in a liver cleanse. Consuming adequate amounts of water each day will naturally help flush toxins out of your body, which will aid your liver.Drinking water also becomes important if you're using a detox drink that causes you to have more frequent bowel movements.   Any time your body loses more fluids than it takes in, you run the risk of becoming dehydrated. This is particularly common during bouts of diarrhea or vomiting.Typical signs of dehydration include thirst, infrequent urination, dark-colored urine, dry skin, fatigue/dizziness, and light-headedness. If you experience diarrhea, your body also loses electrolytes. Electrolytes are the minerals like sodium, potassium, and chloride that your body needs in order to continue functioning properly.Water is the best beverage to stay hydrated, but it will not replenish lost electrolytes. Try drinking a little fruit juice in addition to water, or adding sliced lemons, limes, or cucumbers to your water to ensure you do not lose electrolytes.Any detox drink that causes severe bouts of diarrhea or vomiting should be discontinued.  Not all liver cleanse plans involves a detox drink, but many do. The ingredients will vary, depending on the plan you've chosen. Two common liver cleanses are the Five Day Liver Detox and the Dr. Clark Liver Cleanse.   For the Five Day Liver Cleanse, mix eight ounces of fresh citrus juice, eight ounces of spring water, one lemon, one clove of garlic, one teaspoon of olive oil, and a one-inch piece of ginger in a blender. Some versions of this cleanse recommend adding an additional garlic clove and an additional teaspoon of olive oil each day of the cleanse.As the name suggests, the Five Day Liver Cleanse takes five days to complete, and this cleanse drink should be prepared and consumed for five consecutive days. For the Dr. Clark Liver Cleanse, you'll dissolve four tablespoons of epsom salt into three cups of water and measure out four 3/4 cup servings, and drink one serving every two hours. At 9:45 pm blend and drink a half cup (120 ml) of olive oil, one large or two small pink grapefruits freshly juiced, one dose of ornithine, and 10 to 20 drops of black walnut tincture.Unlike the Five Day Liver Cleanse, the Dr. Clark Liver Cleanse can be completed in a single day. If you're following the Dr. Clark Liver Cleanse, you should not eat or drink anything but the detox drink and epsom salt water portions after 2:00 PM. You will also avoid eating anything that contains fat the day of the cleanse.Again, speak with a doctor of pharmacist about any current medications (including supplements) to make sure they don't interact with grapefruit.  Many liver cleanses advise that you avoid taking unnecessary vitamins or medicines before and/or during the cleanse, though it goes without saying that you should continue to take all prescription medications as usual. The biggest change will be to your regular diet, before and/or throughout the course of the cleanse.   Some cleanse plans advise eating a no-fat breakfast and lunch, like oatmeal, fruit, fruit juice, or bread with honey. Others advise eating no fat whatsoever during the day of the cleanse, though this may not be manageable for multi-day cleanses. Depending on the plan you're following, you may also have restrictions on what times of day you can eat.Avoid processed foods, high-fat foods, and high-sugar foods, both during the cleanse and as part of your regular day-to-day diet to help keep your body healthy.Drinking lemon water is often considered a low-stress way to help cleanse your body, especially during the course of a liver cleanse.Garlic is thought to help rid the body of toxins, and can be added to your diet both during the cleanse and in the days leading up to your cleanse.The antioxidants in green tea may help flush toxins out of the body. Green tea can be consumed during the cleanse, as it shouldn't violate most cleanse guidelines. It can also be incorporated into your daily diet. Some studies suggest that incorporating avocados into a healthy diet may protect the liver from damage, though further research is required to determine how avocados help the liver and at what dosage.However, avocados do have a relatively high fat content, and may therefore be incompatible with certain cleanse plans. Turmeric is commonly used to alleviate liver problems. Consider incorporating turmeric into your diet, especially during the cleanse., Some herbal supplements are thought to help the liver, especially in people with pre-existing liver problems.Talk to your doctor before taking any supplements, as they could interact with other medications in dangerous ways.   B vitamins may help improve liver function in some people, though further studies are needed on how effective vitamins are in assisting the liver.Milk thistle contains silymarin, which has been shown to treat and prevent liver damage.Schisandra supplements are derived from the plant of the same name. Schisandra is often used to treat liver diseases and to protect the liver from toxins/poisons.Selenium may also help improve liver function.  

stay hydrated.  drink your detox drink.  modify your diet.  consider taking supplements. 

 The cap is a small covering located over the mouthpiece of the inhaler to prevent foreign objects from getting in the inhaler. Pull the cap to remove it and set it in a safe place.An uncapped inhaler can pick up germs and debris, which you will then pump into your lungs. Make sure that you don’t lose your cap while you’re using your inhaler.; , The inhaler should be clean, especially the mouthpiece. Remove the cap and check the inside and outside of the mouthpiece. Check the expiration date to make sure that it can still be used. Wipe any grime or debris off the inhaler with a dry tissue or cotton swab.If the mouthpiece is dirty, wipe it down with rubbing alcohol, and let it dry.  Hold the inhaler in your hand with your index finger on top of the canister. The mouthpiece should be on the bottom with the top of the canister pointing up. Quickly move your inhaler up and down by pumping your forearm or wrist.If you haven’t used it in a while, make sure that you prime it by pumping it until it sprays at full force. Don’t worry about wasting medicine because an unprimed inhaler will not provide you a full dose, putting your breathing at risk. Instructions for priming vary, so know how many pumps it takes to prime yours.  Take off the cap and look inside to make sure that there is no grime or debris inside the spacer. If there is, then try blowing it out. If you can’t clear out the debris, you may need to wash your spacer.Don’t wipe your spacer with a cloth because it will create static cling that attracts your medicine.Clean your spacer by dismantling and washing it in mild dish detergent. Allow it to air dry before putting it back together., Breathe in through your mouth. Open your lungs to their maximum capacity, then hold the breath for just a second., You only need to slightly tilt your head back. This will open your airways so that the medicine can easily flow into your lungs. If you bend your head too far back, you may cut off your throat instead of opening it, however., Release the air from your lungs in preparation for inhaling your medicine from the inhaler., The mouthpiece should sit above your tongue and between your teeth. Close your lips around it, and aim the spray hole at the back of your throat.If you’re using a spacer, the mouthpiece on the spacer goes in your mouth, and the mouthpiece of the inhaler fits in the other end of the spacer.If you don’t have a spacer and don’t want to put the inhaler in your mouth, then you can hold it 1-2 inches in front of your mouth.  Begin inhaling slowly through your mouth as you press down on your inhaler. This will release a dose of your medicine. Keep the mouthpiece in your mouth to help keep the medicine in your mouth. Continue to breathe in for about three to five seconds. Try to push the medication back towards your lungs as you inhale.This movement is known as a "puff."   Only press the canister down once. If you’re holding your inhaler 1-2 inches in front of your mouth, then close your mouth as soon as the dose is delivered. If you’re using a spacer, some spacers have a whistle on them. Listen for the whistle. If you hear it, you are breathing in too rapidly. If you don’t hear it, you are breathing in at an acceptable rate., Your medicine needs time to work, and exhaling too quickly can allow the medicine to escape. You should aim to hold the medicine in your mouth for at least ten seconds, but try to see if you can wait up to a minute.You only have to count to ten on breaths you take from your inhaler.  Exhale slowly and deeply through your mouth, and then resume breathing normally. Rinse your mouth with water thoroughly after using the inhaler. Gargle, then spit the water out. If you’re supposed to take two puffs from your inhaler, wait one minute before repeating the process. Continue to use your inhaler as directed by your doctor. In general, most people take one or two puffs every four to six hours or as needed. It’s especially important to rinse your mouth if your medication is steroid-based because the medicine can cause a secondary yeast infection in the mouth called thrush. Rinsing your mouth after use will help prevent this. 

remove the cap.  inspect the inhaler.  hold the inhaler upright and shake it 5-10 times.  prepare your spacer if you’re using one.  take a deep breath.  tilt your head back.  exhale slowly.  place the inhaler or the inhaler with the spacer in your mouth.  breathe in as you press down on the canister.  hold your breath and count to 10.  remove the mouthpiece from your mouth. 

 Track your spending and income to get an accurate picture of your financial situation. Save receipts or write down your purchases in a notebook as you make them. Review your bills each month and add those expenses to your budget.   Organize your purchases by category (food, clothing, entertainment, etc.). Categories with the highest monthly amounts (or monthly amounts you consider surprisingly high) may be good targets for saving money. Once you've tracked your purchases for a while, create a monthly (or weekly) limit for each category. Make sure the total budget is smaller than your income for that period, with enough leftover for savings if possible.; , Making spur of the moment decisions can balloon your expenditures. Write down what you need to buy while you're calm and at home.   Make a preliminary trip before you go on your real shopping trip. Note the prices of several alternatives at one or more stores. Return home without buying anything and decide which products to buy on your second, "real" expedition.The more focused you are and the less time you spend in the store, the less you'll spend.If you are motivated to treat each purchase as an important decision, you will make better decisions.Do not accept free samples or try something on just for fun. Even if you don't plan on purchasing it, the experience can convince you to make a decision now instead of considering it carefully in advance., If planning your purchases in advance is a good idea, buying something on the spur of the moment is a terrible one. Follow these tips to avoid making shopping decisions for the wrong reasons:   Don't browse store windows or shop for fun. If you're only buying something because you find the act of shopping fun, you'll likely end up spending too much on stuff you don't need.Don't make purchasing decisions when your judgment is impaired. Alcohol, other drugs, or sleep deprivationcan harm your ability to make sensible decisions. Even shopping while hungry or listening to loud musiccan be a bad idea if you don't stick to your shopping list.  Children, friends who love shopping, or even just a friend whose tastes you respect can influence you to spend extra money.Do not take advice from store employees. If you need a question answered, politely listen to their response but ignore any advice on purchasing decisions. If they won't leave you alone, leave the store and return later to make your decision.  Credit and debit cards increase spending for two reasons: you have much more money available to spend than you normally would, and because no visible money is changing hands, it doesn't register as a "real" purchase. Similarly, running up a bar tab or using a delayed payment scheme makes it harder to realize how much you're actually spending.Don't bring more cash with you than you need. If you don't have the extra money, you can't spend it.Similarly, withdraw your weekly budget from an ATM once a week rather than filling up your wallet whenever you run out.  Outside influences are a huge factor affecting what we spend our money on. Be vigilant and try to be aware of all the reasons you're drawn to a product.   Don't buy something on the basis of an advertisement. Whether on television or the product's packaging, treat ads with skepticism. They are designed to encourage you to spend money and will not provide an accurate portrayal of your options. Don't purchase something just because it's reduced price.Coupons and sales are great for products you were already planning to buy; purchasing something you don't need just because it's 50% off does not save money! Be aware of pricing tricks. Translate that "$1.99" price into "$2". Judge the price of an item on its own merits, not because it's a "better deal" than another option by the same company. (By making the "worse deal" atrocious value, someone can trick you into paying more for add-ons you don't need). Don't automatically buy the mid priced product within a category. Marketers know that if they want you to buy a high-priced product instead of a low-priced product, they can influence your decision by adding an outrageously expensive product to make the high-priced product intermediate in price and look reasonable in comparison.  If you know you'll need a particular item but don't need it today, wait until it ends up in the bargain bin or try to find a coupon for it.    Only use a coupon or take advantage of a discount for an item you absolutely need or decided to buy before the discount occurred. The attraction of a cheaper price is an easy way to get customers to buy something they don't need. Buy products only useful at particular times of year during the offseason. A winter coat should be cheap during summer weather.  Before making expensive purchases, go online or read consumer reports to find out how to get the most bang for the least buck. Find the product within your budget that will last longest and meet your needs best.  You'll end up paying a lot more than the sticker price for many big-ticket items. Read all the fine print and add up the total amount before making your decision.   Don't be fooled by lower monthly payments. Calculate the total amount you'll spend (monthly payments x number of months until fully paid) to find out what the cheapest option is. If you're taking out a loan, calculate how much total interest you'll have to pay.  This may sound paradoxical (isn't this buying something you don't need?) but in fact, it's easier to maintain your spending goals if you give yourself the occasional reward. Try to go cold turkey on unnecessary spending and you may eventually "crack" and splurge much more than you should.Set aside a very limited amount of money in your budget for these treats. The goal is to give yourself a small reward to keep your spirits up and prevent a giant splurge later. If your usual methods of treating yourself are expensive, find cheaper alternatives. Take a bubble bath at home instead of going to the spa, or borrow a movie from the library instead of going to the theater.  Go through your closet and see what you already have. Sell or give away anything you don’t wear or that doesn’t fit so you have a better idea of your situation.   Clearing out your closet is not an excuse to buy replacements. The goal is to find out what types of clothing you have enough of, and which you actually need more of.  It's foolish to buy the priciest brand of socks, since socks wear out quickly. However, spending more money on a pair of higher quality, longer lasting shoes may save you money in the long run.   Remember that price doesn't guarantee quality. Research what the longest lasting brands are rather than assume the most expensive option is best. Similarly, wait until the item you need goes on sale when possible. Remember not to use sales an excuse to purchase items you don't require.  Some secondhand clothing shops carry surprisingly high-quality items. At the very least, you should be able to purchase basic items for a fraction of brand new prices.   Thrift stores in more affluent neighborhoods usually receive higher-quality donations.  A designer logo does not indicate a higher quality.  Once you have an amount budgeted for food, write down in advance the exact meals you will eat and what you need to purchase at the grocery store to make them.   This will not only prevent you from making impulse buys at the grocery store, but also prevent wasting money due to food waste, a major expenditure for many people.If you find yourself throwing away food, reduce the size of your planned meals.  There are many ways to save money while grocery shopping, from buying food in bulk to knowing the times of day when various products are cheaper.  Eating out is much more expensive than preparing your own food, and should never be done as an impulse by someone who is trying to save money.   Pack a lunch at home instead and bring it with you to work or class. Fill a water bottle using your tap at home instead of buying expensive bottled water. Similarly, if you drink coffee frequently, buy a cheap French press and save money by preparing it at home.  Making wise spending decisions goes hand in hand with saving. Budget as much as you can each month toward a savings account or other reliable, interest-accumulating investment. The more money you save each month, the better your overall financial health will be. Which is pretty much the point of spending money wisely, isn't it? Here are some savings ideas for you to consider:   Establish an emergency fund.  Start a Roth IRA or a 401(k).  Avoid unnecessary fees. Meal plan your meals for the week  , Compulsive habits such as smoking, drinking, or gambling can easily consume any money you save. Eliminating them from your life is both a boon to your wallet and your health.  If you're unsure about a particular purchase, ask yourself these questions. If you don't answer "yes" to all of them, that's a strong sign you shouldn't spend the money.   Will I use this item regularly? Make sure you'll drink all that milk before it goes bad, or that you have enough summer months left to wear that skirt more than a couple times. Do I lack something that serves the same purpose? Beware specialized products whose role can be performed by basic items you already have.You probably don't need ultra-specialized kitchen equipment, or a special workout outfit when sweatpants and a T-shirt will work just as well.Will this item change my life for the better? This is a tricky question, but purchases that encourage "bad habits" or cause you to neglect important parts of your life should be avoided. Will I miss this item if I don't buy it? Will this item make me happy?  , If you have a gym membership and don’t use it, don’t renew it. Avid collector turned to lukewarm possessor? Sell it. Devote your finances and your energy only into areas you are truly passionate about.  

create a budget.  plan your purchases in advance.  avoid impulse purchases.  shop alone.  pay in full and in cash.  don't be fooled by marketing.  wait for sales and discounts.  do your research.  take all the costs into account.  give yourself occasional, inexpensive treats.  only purchase what you actually need.  know when to spend more for quality.  shop at thrift stores.  if you can't find it in a thrift store, buy cheap, generic brands.  compile a weekly menu and shopping list.  learn tips for saving money on food.  minimize dining at restaurants.  save money.  break free of expensive habits.  don't buy what you don't need.  prune your hobbies. 

 C code needs to be compiled by a program that interprets the code into signals that the machine can understand. Compilers are usually free, and different compilers are available for different operating systems.   For Windows, try Microsoft Visual Studio Express or MinGW. For Mac, XCode is one of the best C compilers. For Linux, gcc is one of the most popular options.; , C is one of the older programming languages, and can be very powerful. It was designed for Unix operating systems, but has been ported and expanded for nearly all operating systems. The modern version of C is C++.   C is essentially comprised of functions, and in these functions you can use variables, conditional statements, loops to store and manipulate data.  Take a look at the (very) basic program below to get a good idea about how some of the various aspects of the language work together, and to get an idea of how programs function.      #include <stdio.h>   int main()  {     printf("Hello, World!\n");     getchar();     return 0; }     The #include command occurs before the program starts, and loads libraries that contain the functions you need. In this example, stdio.h lets us use the printf() and getchar() functions. The int main() command tells the compiler that the program is running the function called "main" and that it will return an integer when it is finished. All C programs run a "main" function. The {} indicate that everything inside them is part of the function. In this case, they denote that everything inside is a part of the "main" function. The printf() function displays the contents of the parentheses on the user's screen. The quotes ensure that the string inside is printed literally. The \n sequence tells the compiler to move the cursor to the next line. The ; denotes the end of a line. Most lines of C code need to end with a semicolon. The getchar() command tells the compiler to wait for a keystroke input before moving on. This is useful because many compilers will run the program and immediately close the window. This keeps the program from finishing until a key is pressed. The return 0 command indicates the end of the function. Note how the "main" function is an int function. This means that it will need an integer to be returned once the program is finished. A "0" indicates that the program has performed correctly; any other number will mean that the program ran into an error.  Enter the code into your code editor and save it as a "*.c" file. Compile it in your compiler, typically by clicking the Build or Run button.  Comments are part of the code that is not compiled, but allows you to explain what is happening. This is useful for reminding yourself what your code is for, and for helping other developers who might be looking at your code.   To comment in C place /* at the start of the comment and */ at the end. Comment on all but the most basic parts of your code. Comments can be used to quickly remove parts of your code without deleting them. Simply enclose the code you want to exclude with comment tags and then compile. If you want to add the code back, remove the tags.  Variables allow you to store data, either from computations in the program or from user input. Variables need to be defined before you can use them, and there are several types to choose from.   Some of the more common variables include int, char, and float. Each one stores a different type of data.  Variables need to be established, or "declared", before they can be used by the program. You declare a variable by entering the data type followed by the variable's name. For example, the following are all valid variable declarations:      float x; char name; int a, b, c, d;      Note that you can declare multiple variables on the same line, as long as they are the same type. Simply separate the variable names with commas. Like many lines in C, each variable declaration line needs to end with a semicolon.  Variables must be declared at the beginning of each code block (The parts of your code that are enclosed in {} brackets). If you try to declare a variable later in the block, the program will not function correctly.  Now that you know the basics of how variables work, you can write a simple program that will store the user's input. You will be using another function in the program, called scanf. This function searches the input that is provided for specific values.      #include <stdio.h>   int main() {   int x;     printf( "Enter a number: " );   scanf( "%d", &x );   printf( "You entered %d", x );   getchar();   return 0; }      The "%d" string tells scanf to look for integers in the user input. The & before the variable x tells scanf where to find the variable in order to change it, and stores the integer in the variable. The final printf command reads back the input integer to the user.  You can use mathematical expressions to manipulate the data that you have stored in your variables. The most important distinction to remember for mathematical expressions is that a single = sets the value of the variable, while == compares the values on either side to see if they are equal.      x = 3 * 4; /* sets "x" to 3 * 4, or 12 */ x = x + 3; /* adds 3 to the original value of "x", and sets the new value as the variable */ x == 15; /* checks to see if "x" equals 15 */ x < 10; /* checks if the value of "x" is less than 10 */     , Conditional statements are what drive most programs. They are statements that are determined to be either TRUE or FALSE, and then acted upon based on the result. The most basic of the statements is the if statement.   TRUE and FALSE work differently in C than what you might be used to. TRUE statements always end up equaling a nonzero number. When you perform comparisons, if the result is TRUE then a "1" is returned. If the result is FALSE, then a "0" is returned. Understanding this will help you see how IF statements are processed.  Conditional statements revolve around the use of mathematical operators that compare values. The following list contains the most commonly used conditional operators.      >   /* greater than */ <   /* less than */ >=  /* greater than or equal to */ <=  /* less than or equal to */ ==  /* equal to */ !=  /* not equal to */          10 > 5 TRUE 6 < 15 TRUE 8 >= 8 TRUE 4 <= 8 TRUE 3 == 3 TRUE 4 != 5 TRUE     , You can use IF statements to determine what the program should do next after the statement is evaluated. You can combine it with other conditional statements later to create powerful multiple options, but for now write a simple one to get used to them.      #include <stdio.h>   int main() {   if ( 3 < 5 )     printf( "3 is less than 5");     getchar(); }     , You can build upon IF statements by using ELSE and ELSE IF statements to handle different results. ELSE statements run if the IF statement is FALSE. ELSE IF statements allow you to include multiple IF statements into one code block to handle various cases. See the example program below to see how they interact.      #include <stdio.h>   int main() {   int age;     printf( "Please enter your current age: " );   scanf( "%d", &age );   if ( age <= 12 ) {     printf( "You're just a kid!\n" );   }   else if ( age < 20 ) {     printf( "Being a teenager is pretty great!\n" );   }   else if ( age < 40 ) {     printf( "You're still young at heart!\n" );   }   else {     printf( "With age comes wisdom.\n" );   }   return 0; }     The program takes the input from the user and takes it through the IF statements. If the number satisfies the first statement, then the first printf statement is returned. If it does not satisfy the first statement, it is taken through each ELSE IF statement until it finds one that works. If it doesn't match any of them, it goes through the ELSE statement at the end.  Loops are one of the most important aspects of programming, as they allow you to repeat blocks of code until specific conditions are met. This can make repeating actions very easy to implement, and keeps you from having to write new conditional statements each time you want something to happen.   There are three main types of loops: FOR, WHILE, and DO...WHILE.  This is the most common and useful loop type. It will continue running the function until the conditions set in the FOR loop are met. FOR loops require three conditions: initializing the variable, the condition to be met, and the way the variable is updated. If you don't need all of these conditions, you will still need to leave a blank space with a semicolon, otherwise the loop will run forever.#include <stdio.h>   int main() {   int y;     for ( y = 0; y < 15; y++;){     printf( "%d\n", y );   }   getchar(); }      In the above program, y is set to 0, and the loop continues as long as the value of y is less than 15. Each time the value of y is printed, 1 is added to the value of y and the loop is repeated. Once y = 15, the loop will break.  WHILE loops are more simple than FOR loops. They only have one condition, and the loop acts as long as that condition is true. You do not need to initialize or update the variable, though you can do that in the main body of the loop.      #include <stdio.h>   int main() {   int y;     while ( y <= 15 ){     printf( "%d\n", y );     y++;   }   getchar(); }      The y++ command adds 1 to the y variable each time the loop is executed. Once y hits 16 (remember, this loop goes as long as y is less than or equal to 15), the loop breaks.  This loop is very useful for loops that you want to ensure run at least once. In FOR and WHILE loops, the condition is checked at the beginning of the loop, meaning it could not pass and fail immediately. DO...WHILE loops check conditions at the end of the loop, ensuring that the loop executes at least once.      #include <stdio.h>   int main() {   int y;     y = 5;   do {     printf("This loop is running!\n");   } while ( y != 5 );   getchar(); }      This loop will display the message even though the condition is FALSE. The variable y is set to 5 and the WHILE loop is set to run when y does not equal 5, so the loop terminates. The message was already printed since the condition is not checked until the end. The WHILE loop in a DO...WHILE set must be ended with a semicolon. This is the only time a loop is ended with a semicolon.  Functions are self-contained blocks of code that can be called upon by other parts of the program. They make it very easy to repeat code, and they help make the program simpler to read and change. Functions can include all of the previously-covered techniques learned in this article, and even other functions.   The main() line at the beginning of all of the above examples is a function, as is getchar()  Functions are essential to efficient and easy-to-read code. Make good use of functions to streamline your program.  Functions are best created when you outline what you want it to accomplish before you begin the actual coding. The basic syntax for functions is "return_type name ( argument1, argument2, etc.);". For example, to create a function that adds two numbers:      int add ( int x, int y );      This will create a function that adds two integers (x and y) and then returns the sum as an integer.  You can use the outline to create a program that takes two integers that the user enters and then adds them together. The program will define how the "add" function works and use it to manipulate the input numbers.      #include <stdio.h>   int add ( int x, int y );   int main() {   int x;   int y;     printf( "Enter two numbers to add together: " );   scanf( "%d", &x );   scanf( "%d", &y );   printf( "The sum of your numbers is %d\n" , add( x, y ) );   getchar(); }   int add ( int x , int y ) {   return x + y; }      Note that the outline is still located at the top of the program. This tells the compiler what to expect when the function is called and what it will return. This is only necessary if you want to define the function later in the program. You could define add() before the main() function and the result would be the same without the outline. The actual functionality of the function is defined at the bottom of the program. The main() function collects the integers from the user and then sends them to the add() function to be processed. The add() function then returns the results to main()  Now the add() has been defined, it can be called anywhere in the program.  This article covers the basics, but it only scratches the surface of C programming and all the associated knowledge. A good reference book will help you solve problems and save you from a lot of headaches down the road.  There are lots of communities, both online and in the real world, dedicated to programming and all of the languages that entails. Find some like-minded C programmers to swap code and ideas with, and you will soon find yourself learning a lot.   Attend some hack-a-thons if possible. These are events where teams and individuals have time limits to come up with programs and solutions, and often foster a lot of creativity. You can meet a lot of good programmers this way, and hack-a-thons happen regularly across the globe.  You don't have to go back to school for a Computer Science degree, but taking a few classes can do wonders for your learning. Nothing beats hands-on help from people who are well-versed in the language. You can often find classes at local community centers and junior colleges, and some universities will allow you to audit their computer science programs without having to enroll.  Once you have a grasp of C, it wouldn't hurt to start taking a look at C++. This is the more modern version of C, and allows for a lot more flexibility. C++ is designed with object handling in mind, and knowing C++ can enable you to create powerful programs for virtually any operating system.  

download and install a compiler.  understand the basics.  examine some basic code.  try compiling the program.  always comment on your code.  understand the function of variables.  learn how variables are declared.  know where to declare variables.  use variables to store user input.  manipulate your variables.  understand the basics of conditional statements.  learn the basic conditional operators.  write a basic if statement.  use else/else if statements to expand your conditions.  understand how loops work.  use a for loop.  use a while loop.  use a do...while loop.  understand the basics of functions.  start with an outline.  add the function to a program.  find a few c programming books.  join some communities.  take some classes.  consider learning c++. 

 Exfoliating facial scrubs are sold at most supermarkets, drug stores, and stores that sell beauty products. They usually have small granules designed to force out dead skin cells and debris.   Prices for exfoliating scrubs range. Some are quite expensive, selling for as much as $30, while others might go for under $10. Browsing reviews online or in beauty magazines can help you make an informed decision about the best scrub for you.Exfoliating scrubs have been criticized by environmentalists. Many of the scrubs use non-disposable plastic beads as granules and this leads to pollution in great lakes and other bodies of water. If you're wary about the environmental impact, it might be a good idea to opt to make your own eco-friendly scrub at home., A simple sugar and honey scrub can help exfoliate skin and is simple to make. If you're on a budget or distrustful of the heavy use of plastic in some exfoliating scrubs, this might be a better option.   In general, mix equal parts raw honey and sugar. Mix together well and store in an air tight container at room temperature., Using the scrub you chose, work the concoction into your skin. Use circular motions. Scrub for about two minutes. Be gentle. The beads or grains of sugar should exfoliate your skin without too much extra pressure from you rubbing., Once you've scrubbed for two minutes, wash off your skin.   Use cold water. Wash until skin is clean of the substance used. Pat dry with a clean towel.Rub a light facial moisturizer, one that does not use too many oils, into your face once it's fully dry. 

buy an exfoliating facial scrub.  make a sugar and honey scrub.  rub your scrub on in circular motions.  wash off your face and apply moisturizers. 

 German Shepherds can be fairly aloof and reserved when first meeting new people. However, once the dog has formed a connection with their owner, they are extremely loyal. German Shepherds are usually friendly and loyal to their family, but can be protective if they feel threatened., German Shepherds are high energy dogs and they need lots of daily exercise. If a German Shepherd is left a lone for long periods of time it will likely become bored and destructive. For example, the dog may start barking, chewing things, or digging. Make sure that your German Shepherd receives at least 1 hour of exercise each day., This breed is highly intelligent and trainable. They like to have a job or task to do, and you can train a German Shepherd to do a variety of different jobs. For example, German Shepherd's are often used as "working" dogs, helping with search and rescue, drug sniffing and security, as well as providing aide and assistance to the visibly impaired.Take your German Shepherd to obedience classes to train the dog to follow commands and complete a variety of tasks. This is fun and stimulating for the dog.  

notice the dog's loyalty.  recognize the dog's energy level.  see if the dog is trainable. 

   Certain personal documents such as a birth certificate must be provided when someone applies for immigration to the U.S. However, in some cases these documents may be unavailable or impossible to obtain. For example, the facility where birth certificates were stored may have burned down, or the immigrant may live in a war-torn area where government authority was non-existent when he or she was born and such documents were never created.If an applicant cannot obtain certain types of required documents, USCIS will accept sworn declarations as substitutes. The applicant also must include a sworn declaration regarding why the original document is unavailable.An immigration applicant may need a sworn declaration from you because you have first-hand knowledge of the facts that would be proven by the document. For example, you may be able to confirm the person's birthdate or place of birth.Additionally, if you are a government worker in the person's home country, you may be called upon to write a sworn declaration explaining why the original document required for the person's immigration application is not available., Before you write your sworn declaration, plan it out so the information is organized and flows well in your final document.   The information you include will depend on the purpose of your declaration. Generally, you should not include facts for which you do not have first-hand knowledge.For example, if you know the person for whom you're writing the declaration was born on July 4, 1984 because he told you so, this isn't sufficient knowledge to prove the accuracy of his birthdate. However, if you were present at his birth – maybe you were a nurse or the doctor who delivered him – that first-hand knowledge would support his claim regarding his date of birth. Include as many details as possible. Specific details about the necessary facts that support the person's application are more important than any formal wording, legal terms, or fancy formatting., You may write a sworn declaration either in business letter format, or using the traditional format for a legal affidavit.   If the person for whom you're writing the declaration has an attorney, there may be a particular format he or she prefers. Additionally, you may be able to find sample declarations online that you can use as guides. However, you should be careful about copying language from sample declarations that doesn't apply to your particular situation. Regardless of the format you use, a sworn declaration isn't technically an affidavit since you won't be required to sign the document in the presence of a notary. However, your signature still verifies under penalty of perjury that the information in the declaration is true and correct to the best of your knowledge.In both formats, the text is single-spaced with a double-space between paragraphs. Use a basic, legible font such as the default font for your word-processing application.  The title tells the USCIS officer what the document is and the name of the immigrant to whom it relates.   For example, your title might be "Declaration in Support of Application of ..." with the applicant's full legal name as it appears on his or her immigration application.If you're writing a business letter, the title becomes the subject line of your letter, but it should contain the same information.  You must begin your declaration by providing your full legal name and residence along with your birth date and place of birth.   Include your phone number or other contact information in case the USCIS officer who reviews your declaration needs to contact you for further information or wants to schedule an interview to discuss your declaration.You should next identify how you know the information you're about to present on behalf of the applicant. What you write here will depend on your situation. For example, if you're writing to support the applicant's birth date because you were the doctor who delivered her, you would state that you were a doctor in the town where she was born. You might also include information about how long you had been a doctor or hospitals where you worked. Any information that supports your authority and knowledge is relevant., If you are using the traditional legal format for an affidavit, the paragraphs should be numbered. However, if you're using a business letter format, you can present your facts in a basic narrative style.   How long your declaration is will depend on the facts you're being asked to verify. A simple declaration confirming someone's birthdate may only be a paragraph or two. However, if you're asked to write a declaration in support of the fact that the applicant is no longer married because his wife died, you may have to write a substantially longer declaration to include all the details and relate how you have first-hand knowledge of those facts.Describing details of facts and circumstances increases the likelihood that your statement will be accepted as truth of the information the applicant claimed. Therefore, you should include as many details as you can remember, regardless of whether you believe they are relevant., You must close your declaration with a statement that the declaration was signed under oath.   The standard wording is "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge."Skip a few lines under this statement for your signature, then type your full legal name and leave another space to enter the date by hand when you sign your declaration., After you've finalized your declaration, you may wish to print a copy for your records. Then you typically submit it either to the person for whom you wrote the declaration or their attorney.If the applicant is represented by an attorney, the attorney may wish to review your declaration and suggest changes that would make it more supportive of the immigration application.  

talk to the person immigrating to the u.s. before you write your sworn declaration, you need to know the information for which the person needs supplemental documentation.  outline the facts.  format your document.  title your declaration.  identify yourself.  present your facts in numbered paragraphs.  close your declaration.  print and sign your declaration. 

 If you aren’t looking at your spouse, you aren’t giving them your full attention. Put down the iPhone or computer and turn off the TV. It’s nearly impossible to pay adequate attention to someone when our attention is divided., Making eye contact with your spouse lets them know that you are focused on them alone and ready to listen. Your facial expression matters, too. Don’t scowl at them or roll your eyes when they begin speaking., Often, we think we are listening to our spouse, when we are busy crafting our response or argument in our heads. This is not good listening because you’re only partially hearing your spouse because your main focus is on what you’re planning to say next. This leads us to jump into the conversation, usually before it’s our turn to speak. Few things are more detrimental to a spouse who needs to feel that they’re being heard than being repeatedly cut off mid-sentence by their partner.   To be a good listener, it's important to avoid dominating conversations. This is related to not interrupting and might seem obvious, but often couples begin to struggle with this concept over time: you can’t be listening if you’re speaking. Be patient and allow your spouse as much time as they need to talk or vent to you., Everyone feels busy and overextended at times between work, school, and family obligations. However, it is important to carve out even ten minutes a day to sit with your spouse and talk. The benefits of this are twofold. First, if you mention to your spouse that you want to prioritize talking to them, then that shows that you care about your relationship and are willing to be proactive to help improve it. Secondly, the ten or more minutes you set aside will help your overall communication if you use the time to give each other a “status report” on your days and how you’re both feeling.   Try to ensure that your discussions are productive. Don’t use this private time to complain that the house is dirty, even if it is. Use this time to talk about a tough project at work or an upcoming event you both have, for example. Then be sure to ask your spouse how their day went and actively listen to them. If you have truly opposite schedules that make this difficult, then you might try Skype or FaceTime as ways to still communicate with each other. 

stop whatever you’re doing.  look at them when they talk.  don’t interrupt your spouse.  dedicate time each day to talk. 

 If you are not interested in her, you should respond by not engaging in the flirtatious behaviour. You should continue to be kind towards her, but keep your interactions strictly on a friendship level., You can show that you are not interested by using closed body language, such as crossing your arms, turning your body away from her, and avoiding frequent or extended eye contact., If she continues to flirt with you, despite your attempts to convey disinterest, then you should have a conversation with her about it. Tell her that you aren’t interested in a romantic relationship with her. You should be direct and to the point, so that there is no misinterpretation.Let her know you would still like to be friends with her, if this is the case.

 The best way to get your children to value saving money is by showing them how to do it. Show your children your family’s budget and talk with them about how you are planning for your retirement, their future college expenses, and other savings goals. Modeling responsibility will likely lead to similar behavior from your children., In order to teach your children how to save money, you should practice money-saving lessons. Teach them how to use coupons or help them start a lemonade stand. These things will help them better understand the importance of a budget and how to save money.For example, you could encourage small children to place their money in three jars: one for savings, one for spending, and another for donating. This will help them gain an understanding of how adults budget their money.  With older children, you should consider giving them an allowance for completing household chores. This will help them become more responsible around the house and learn how to budget their money. Encourage them to save their allowance money for larger items like video games or bicycles., Once they are old enough, ask your kids to get a part-time job or do odd jobs around the neighborhood. Your kids can earn a little extra money by babysitting, mowing lawns, walking dogs, or shoveling snow. Encourage your children to put the money they have earned towards your savings goal.Do not force your children to put the money they earned towards their savings. This will make them resentful and less likely to want to contribute. Instead, remind them of the benefits of saving but allow them to make the final decision about their money.  

model responsible money management.  practice saving money.  give your children an allowance.  encourage older children to work.

 This is the same formula used to graph regular linear equations, but instead of an ‘=’ sign being used, you will be given an inequality sign. The inequality sign will either be <, >, <, or >.   Slope intercept form is y=mx+b, where m=slope and b=y-intercept. Having an inequality present means that there are multiple solutions.  Find the y-intercept and the slope to mark your coordinates. If we use the example of y>1/2x+1, then the y-intercept is ‘1’. The slope is ½, meaning you move up one point and to the right two points.  Before you draw it though, check the inequality symbol that is being used. If it is a “greater than” symbol, your line should be dashed. If it is a “greater than or equal to” symbol, your line should be solid.  Because there are multiple solutions to an inequality, you must show all possible solutions on your graph. This means you will shade all of your graph above or below your line.   Choose a coordinate - the origin at (0,0) is often the easiest. Make sure that you note if this coordinate is above or below the line you’ve drawn. Substitute these coordinates into your inequality. Following our example, it would be 0>1/2(0)+1. Solve this inequality. If the coordinate pair is a point above your line and the answer is true, then you would shade above the line. If the answer to the inequality is false, then you would shade below the line. If the coordinate lies below your line and the answer is true, then you shade below your line. If your answer is false, then shade above our line. In our example, (0,0) is below our line and creates a false solution when substituted into the inequality. That means that we shade the remainder of the graph above the line. 

use the slope intercept form.  graph the inequality.  draw your line.  shade your graph.

 The most important step you can take in increasing your rabbit’s lifespan is getting them fixed. This will also likely make it easier to get along with your rabbit. Neutering a male rabbit and spaying a female rabbit will greatly reduce the risk of disease, and will prevent rabbits of both sexes from becoming aggressive. Have these procedures performed once a rabbit is four months old. Be sure to take your rabbits to a vet that has experience caring for rabbits.  Though you want to minimize the amount of time you spend holding most rabbits, it is safe to do so for a short time. Make sure to fully support the weight of the rabbit’s body. Always use your arm or body to provide a surface for your rabbit's hind legs as well.Never lift a rabbit by its ears. Never hold a rabbit with its belly upward.  Even if they’re shy, your rabbit should be active and alert. A healthy rabbit will frequently walk around its cage, eating, drinking, and making soft noises. If these behaviors are not occurring, look for other signs your rabbit may be sick. Make sure breathing is clear, and that the rabbit’s eyes and fur look healthy. If your rabbit begins to lose weight or hair, is lethargic, or has discharge coming from any part of their body, take them to a veterinarian. 

get your rabbit fixed.  hold a rabbit correctly.  watch for signs of injury or illness. 

 Turn the heat dial to the setting that is most appropriate for your fabric. Once you've selected a heat level, the metal will begin to grow warm. Let the iron become hot. You shouldn't need to wait more than a matter of seconds.The heat levels are often listed in relation to a certain type of fabric. For instance, cotton responds well to high heat and steam, but some synthetic fabrics might melt or fuse if they're exposed to such temperatures.Do not use an inappropriate setting! Start with a low heat and work up. If you are ironing more than one item, start with the one that uses the lowest setting on the iron. This way, you won't need to let the iron cool down before you continue., Run the hot flat side of the iron firmly and slowly across the fabric. Smooth out the wrinkles. For the best results, work with the natural folds and creases of the garment.         Iron each individual part of the garment separately. For instance, if you're ironing a dress shirt, smooth out the collar, then the cuffs, then the sleeves, then the shoulders, then the placket – and, finally, the main body of the shirt.Do not let the iron rest directly on the garment, lest the fabric overheats. If you are careless with the iron, you might start a fire!  , Now, flip the piece of clothing over and iron the other side. Make sure not to flatten any wrinkles or creases into the new side.  If you bunch up the garment or leave it laying out, then there's a good chance that it will dry with wrinkles. Hang the fabric on a clothes hanger and let it air-dry.  

heat up the iron.  iron the first side.  smooth out the other side.  hang the clothing immediately after ironing. 

 Use a comb to achieve a precise part. Working with hair that is slightly damp might make it easier as well. You can use hair ties or clips to hold the sections as you create them., Ask for help if you have a hard time French braiding your own hair. Two sets of hands will help speed up the process. Depending on how many sections you decide to braid, this step could take several hours, so you might appreciate the help and the company.  If your braid is thicker than a half inch, you need to section off your hair in smaller widths. A braid that is too thick will only achieve wavy hair. Make smaller sections of tighter braids to give yourself the fullest afro possible.  A volumizing mousse or setting lotion will help to create firm, long-lasting curls.  To simplify this step, you can make a solution of 20% setting lotion or gel and 80% water and saturate the braids with the solution.,  Start with wet or damp hair before bed, and you will be ready to finish your afro when you get up in the morning. If you don't want to wait, you can use a hair dryer to dry the braids faster.  Make sure the braids are completely dry before taking them out. If your hair seems tangled, apply a moisturizer like shea or coconut butter to the remaining braids to make the rest of the process easier., If you have long hair, bend over and let the weight of your hair and gravity help the process. Your hair should appear much more curly than before., Do this one section at a time. Creating smaller sections to backcomb will help to create greater volume than larger chunks of hair., Use a fine-toothed comb and brush your hair gently from the tip to the scalp to separate the hairs from the section. This will create tangles in the hair that will give your afro more volume. Repeat until your hair has the desired fullness.  Do not use too much pressure when backcombing. You don't want the hair to break.  A little hairspray is all you need to hold your afro in place. You can carry a pick comb around to keep your afro detangled and looking fabulous everywhere you go. 

part your hair into at least 6 or 8 even sections, going from your forehead back to your neck.  french braid each section of hair.  wet your hair again and apply styling product.  cover your hair with a satin scarf until dry.  remove the braids.  tousle your hair with your fingers.  divide each of the six or eight sections into four individual sections with a fine-toothed comb.  backcomb (tease) each of the four sections of hair gently until you achieve your desired afro.  set with styling product if needed.

 Use a penny or another coin that is higher in value like a quarter, dime, or half dollar. The larger the value of the coin, the more people will be inclined to pick it up. You’ll also need a long fishing wire. Fishing wire is good for this prank because it is difficult to see.   You can also use a fake coin, as long as it resembles a real coin. You should use about three to five feet of fishing wire. The key is to find a close enough place to hide while performing the trick. You could also use a longer strand, but you shouldn't use more than ten feet of fishing wire.  Use a dab of superglue to attach one end of the fishing wire to the coin. You could also tie the fishing wire onto the coin, but this might come loose easily. Test each method before taking it out into public.  Go to a public setting like a park or somewhere you’ll be able to hide easily. Plant the coin in the middle of a walkway while nobody is around. Go hide somewhere unassuming, but in a place you can easily see the coin.   Make sure you have a grip of the fishing wire and its slack so you can easily pull the string to trick someone.  Wait until a curious stranger comes to pick up your prepared coin. Once they bend over and start to reach for the coin, give the wire a tug. If they begin to chase after the coin, tug the coin again. Keep the prank going for as long as they fall for it.   You can reveal yourself if they haven’t discovered you yet.

 Older dogs can sometimes struggle to get around on hard floors. To reduce your senior dog’s risk of falling or struggling to walk around, place some area rugs around the house. This will improve the chances that your dog can navigate your home safely and comfortably.You can place a large area rug over a bare floor or just place a few small rugs around.; , Older dogs sometimes struggle to get up and down stairs, which may lead to falls or place extra pressure on your dog’s joints. One way to make it easier for your senior dog to get up and down stairs is to place ramps.For example, you might place a ramp going from your backdoor to your backyard if there are a few steps that he has to use to go into the yard. Ramps can also be useful for helping your senior dog get into your car or up on the sofa (if he is allowed)., Some senior dogs struggle with poor eyesight, which can make it harder for them to navigate your home. If you notice that your senior dog frequently bumps into a table or other piece of furniture when he makes his way through your home, then you might consider moving this object aside.   For example, if you have a coffee table in the middle of your living room and your senior dog tends to bump into it sometimes, then you might move the coffee table to the edge of the room when it is not in use.  Some senior dogs develop disabilities, such as hearing loss and blindness. If your senior dog has developed a disability, then talk with your dog’s vet about the modifications you will need to make to ensure your dog’s safety. 

place area rugs over hard floors.  provide ramps wherever there are stairs.  remove obstacles.  ask your veterinarian about special modifications for a disability. 

 Find a piece of cardboard. Using a pen or pencil, draw a plane body shape in the cardboard. The exact shape is up to you, but it should have a tail and a head. Use this image to give you a basic idea of what kind of shape you should make.   Rounded shapes work better than angular ones. You can use another stiff paper material like cardstock as well.; , Use your scissors to cut out the glider body shape you drew in the cardboard.  Use a pencil or pen to mark two wing shapes in the piece of cardboard. The fore wing must be the a little lesser than the length of the glider, and the tail wing must be about half of that. Cut the wing shapes out with scissors.   You can use this image as a guide for what the wing shapes should like, but the exact shape is up to you.  Measure the height of your wings. Mark two lines in your plane that are the length of these measurements, with the bigger one near the middle of the body and the smaller one near the tail end. Use a sharp knife to cut out the slits.  First stick the wings through the slits and position them so that they stick out evenly on both sides. Then glue them in place. Don't use a glue stick; they're not strong enough. Use something like PVA glue, or something similar., Throw it to test its flying ability. You want to add paper clips until it can easily be thrown forward. Without enough weight, the plane will be difficult to send forward with force.  Roll and spread some modeling clay along the nose to make a rounded nose shape. You can do this in addition to or instead of the paper clips.   Experiment with different combinations of modeling clay and paper clips to see what makes your plane fly best.  

mark a glider body shape in cardboard.  cut out the body of your glider from a piece of cardboard.  cut out the wings.  cut out slits for the wings.  glue the wings in place.  attach a paper clip or two onto the nose of the plane.  add modeling clay to the nose optionally. 

 To remove rust and similar corrosion from most coins, try S100 Polishing Soap. You may be surprised at how well this removes rust from coin surfaces. It is also well suited to silver coins, and it is used by German silversmiths to clean silver jewelry. Silver cleaning wadding or batting products are sometimes helpful since these wool or cotton fibers help clean uneven surfaces on coins. Weiman metal polish should do the trick, along with many other brands.  Try the automobile section of your local department store to find a variety of metal polishes and cleaners that can also be used to clean metal coins. You can use silver cleaner, copper cleaner, or other metal cleaner – but the results of any product will be most effective if you're using it on the type of metal for which it is advertised.  Again, only if these coins aren't being cleaned for the purposes of coin collecting – such as in a collection of coins with any emphasis on building monetary value. Be sure to follow all of the manufacturer's instructions and recommendations whenever using ultrasonic cleaning devices.  

use a metal-polishing soap.  look for metal cleaners at an auto-parts store.  try using ultrasonic jewelry cleaners. 

 When you want to remove the skin from a chicken breast, place the breast on a clean cutting board so the skin side is facing up. Choose one side of the breast and take hold of the skin to carefully pull it away from the meat.Don’t worry if the skin doesn’t pull off in one piece. Just grab the remaining piece and tug until all of the skin is removed from the breast.  To skin a chicken thigh, it’s important to start at the joint where the skin is usually most strongly attached. Grab the skin right where it connects to the joint and pull it off in one piece. If you meet any resistance along the way, use a sharp knife to cut the skin free.If you feel like your fingers on slipping on the slick skin, you can use a paper towel to grab it and get better traction. Dipping your fingers in salt can also help, but be sure to pour the salt into a small dish and throw the remainder away after use so you don’t contaminate your salt with bacteria from the raw chicken.  When you’re removing the skin from a chicken drumstick, you should take hold of the meaty end, not the bone. With a firm grip on the skin, pull down toward the bone until it comes off the end. It should come off in one piece, but if the skin tears, just grab the remainder and pull it off the end.If any small bits of skin get stuck along the bone and you want to remove them, use a small knife to carefully scrape them off.  

pull the skin away from one side of a breast.  grasp the skin at the joint side of a thigh.  tug the skin away from the meaty end of a drumstick. 

 There are several types. Although some lawyers will handle legal issues involving all types, some lawyer will specialize in one or two. You should identify which type of intellectual property you have:Patents. Patents are granted by the federal government and confer the right to make, use, sell, or import a product exclusively for a limited amount of time. For example, if you invent a new oral treatment for breast cancer, then you can patent it.  Trade secrets. This is any information that is valuable, such as a secret recipe or process for making or doing something. Trade secrets aren’t patented. Instead, they remain valuable because they are secret.  Trademarks. A trademark is a word or symbol that distinguishes your goods or services from another business’. For example, the word Coca-Cola and the symbol are both trademarks of the Coca-Cola Company.  Copyrights. A novelist has a copyright in her novel, and a photographer has a copyright in his photo. Copyrights are available for works of original authorship.; , Lawyers are a good source of referrals since they know the reputations of other attorneys. If you used a lawyer for a criminal matter or to buy a house, for example, then ask them if they can recommend an intellectual property lawyer.   Fully explain your situation to the lawyer. He or she might see a hidden wrinkle and realize you also need to talk to someone who specializes in First Amendment issues or another area of law.  Bar associations are organizations made up of lawyers. Many provide referrals to the public. You can find your nearest bar association by searching on the American Bar Association website: http://shop.americanbar.org/ebus/ABAGroups/DivisionforBarServices/BarAssociationDirectories/StateLocalBarAssociations.aspx.   Usually, your bar association should have a phone number to call or an online database you can search. If you call, tell the person you need an intellectual property lawyer.  Some of the more reliable databases include Lawyers.com, Nolo, and Martindale-Hubbell. You provide information, such as your location and your legal issue. The database then produces a list of attorneys who meet your requirements.   If you specifically want a patent lawyer, then you can download a zip file containing the names and addresses of all 33,000 active registered patent attorneys: https://oedci.uspto.gov/OEDCI/practitionerRoster.jsp. Plug in your address and find registered patent attorneys in your area.  You might know a creator who has recently used an intellectual property lawyer. Ask them if they would recommend this person. If so, then write down the name.   For example, if you are a writer, ask another writer what lawyer they use.Avoid asking friends or family, unless they’ve used an intellectual property lawyer. Instead, they will likely refer you to someone they know who doesn’t practice IP law at all., If you are an artist with an IP issue, then look in your nearest city for attorneys who volunteer to help artists.About half of all states have volunteer services that provide low-cost legal help.   Search online by typing “your city” and then “volunteer legal services arts.”  , Run a quick Google search and find the lawyer’s website. Spend a few minutes analyzing the website for the following information:    The lawyer’s specialty. Lawyers should list representative cases they have handled recently. Check to see that the lawyer has done intellectual property work in the specialty you need help with. For example, someone who focuses on patent applications might not be the best choice if you have a copyright lawsuit.  Advanced degree. Many law schools offer a master’s degree (LLM) in intellectual property. Look to see if the lawyer has one. Of course, lawyers don’t need an LLM to practice IP law, but this credential shows the lawyer is dedicated to the field.  Board certification. Some states grant certifications in intellectual property. For example, Florida lawyers can get an IP certification if they demonstrate sufficient experience, take continuing legal education courses, pass an exam, and receive positive reviews from peers and judges.  Size of the firm. Some lawyers work as solo practitioners while others are members of a firm. A larger law firm is ideal if you have a very complicated legal issue.  The website’s layout. Does the website look professional? If not, then the lawyer might not be the kind of detail-orientated advocate that you need. Check for typos and poor grammar.  Each state has a disciplinary commission that investigates complaints about lawyers.You can find your state’s commission by looking online. At the state website, search for the lawyer by name. A full disciplinary history should pull up.   Also check the USPTO’s Office of Enrollment and Discipline at https://oedci.uspto.gov/OEDCI/practitionerSearch.jsp. This website will have disciplinary information for registered patent attorneys.  Many websites collect online reviews of lawyers. Check Yahoo, Google+, and Yelp. Don’t accept these reviews uncritically. Often the people who are angriest are the most motivated to leave a negative review.   However, look to see if more than one person makes the same complaint. For example, several people might complain that the lawyer didn’t understand intellectual property. Also check how old the reviews are. Newer reviews might be more representative.  You want to meet with lawyers who are sufficiently qualified to handle your issue and who look professional. Narrow your list to three or four attorneys. You won’t have a lot of time to schedule consultations with more than four.   If you don’t think any of the lawyers are qualified, then go back and get more referrals.  Call up the attorneys and ask if you can schedule a consultation. Your initial meeting will usually last 15-30 minutes. Ask how much it will cost.Some lawyers might offer a free consultation, while others will charge a fee.   You probably will speak to an assistant or secretary. They might ask you some questions to decide whether your issue is one the lawyer can help you with. The lawyer may also send you a questionnaire to fill out and return before the consultation., Lawyers are very busy, so get as organized as possible before your consultation. Make sure to do the following:   Copy relevant documents and put them in an order the lawyer can understand.If you’re being sued for copyright infringement, then have a copy of the complaint and summons to show the lawyer. Also have a copy of your work and the work you allegedly copied. Write down a summary of your issue in a few sentences. Be as brief as possible. However, remember to be honest. Your consultation will be confidential. Dress well. You’ll feel in control and be less intimidated by the lawyer if you look professional.  At the consultation, you want to fully understand how experienced the lawyer is with IP issues. Don’t waste time going over information you can find from the webpage (such as where the lawyer went to school). Instead, ask the following:   How much of their practice is devoted to IP issues? To copyright (or patent, trade secrets, etc.) specifically? Get a breakdown of the types of cases they handle.Have they handled issues like yours before?For example, if you are a band negotiating a contract with a studio, you’ll want a lawyer who has negotiated that type of agreement. Based on their experience, what is the likeliest outcome? For example, if you are applying for a patent, does the lawyer think it will be approved?  , Some lawyers are flexible when it comes to how much they charge and the different billing methods they use. You should certainly discuss fees before leaving your consultation. Try to cover the following areas:   Does the lawyer charge an hourly fee? If so, how much? Do they use alternative billing arrangements, such as a flat fee or contingency fee? With a contingency fee, the lawyer agrees to be paid only if you win. They get a percentage of the amount you win.Contingency fees are used when you bring a lawsuit, not when you defend yourself in one. What else will you be charged for? For example, does the lawyer charge for photocopying, mailing, and research fees?Will the lawyer provide you with an itemized bill? Will the lawyer use other lawyers and paralegals to do the work? If so, how much do they charge?  , Effective communication is critical, and attorney-client relationships often break down because of poor communication. Make sure to ask the lawyer how they communicate.Do they prefer email or a phone call? Can you stop in to talk if you have a problem? Who will return your phone call? Will you talk primarily with an assistant, or will the lawyer call you? How long do they wait to return calls? A lawyer should respond to you within a business day.  Law is a highly-regulated profession, so most lawyers should be reputable. However, some lawyers are in over their heads, and you should pay attention to red flags. Avoid a lawyer that exhibits any of the following:   Doesn’t understand your legal issue. The lawyer might lack sufficient experience in intellectual property or might be too busy to give you their full attention. Is rude or intimidating. The lawyer could be stretched to the max. Guarantees a result. There are very few 100% guarantees. If you want to sue someone, avoid a lawyer who guarantees you will win. Likewise, avoid a lawyer who guarantees your patent will be approved. Has a messy office with papers all over the place. You want a lawyer to keep your client confidences. A lawyer who leaves client files out in the open is probably not sufficiently careful.  If you didn’t like any of the lawyers you met with, then go back and get more referrals. However, if one or more were acceptable, then consider the following as you make your choice:Your comfort around the attorney. You will likely be working closely together, so you shouldn’t hire someone unless you feel comfortable. How well you understood the case. You want a lawyer who doesn’t speak down to you but who helps you understand the legal issues. You can’t make decisions as a client if you don’t know what is happening. The reasonableness of the fee. There is no reason to hire someone you can’t afford, so confirm that you can pay the fee. The lawyer’s experience. Don’t hire someone unless you have confidence in their abilities.  Call up the lawyer and tell them you want to hire them. They should send you an engagement letter to sign (also called a “fee agreement” or “fee retainer”). Read this document carefully. It should explain in detail what the lawyer will do for you and how you will be billed.If you don’t agree with something in the agreement, then call up the lawyer. Don’t sign until you agree with everything. After signing, keep a copy for your own records.  

identify your type of intellectual property.  ask another lawyer for a referral.  contact your nearest bar association.  search online databases.  get a referral from another creator.  look for low cost legal help for artists.  study the lawyer’s website.  check the lawyer’s disciplinary history.  read online reviews.  narrow your list.  schedule consultations with a few lawyers.  prepare for the consultation.  ask questions about the lawyer’s experience.  discuss the lawyer’s fees.  ask how the lawyer communicates.  identify red flags.  choose a lawyer.  sign an engagement letter.

 For helping them exercise, provide them with a solid wheel in their cage. Do not use wire or mesh wheels as it can cause bumble foot. Make sure the wheel is big enough so that your hamster's back isn't arching when it runs in the wheel, as that can cause back problems. If you want to bring your hamster out of the cage, provide a hamster ball or a playpen. Don't leave your hamster out for too long, because it can get stresses.  A hamster's teeth really grow fast, especially dwarf hamsters. Provide them with chew toys such as wooden chews to help trim their teeth.

 Maybe your bedroom has enough space, maybe you have a big room in your basement or maybe you can practice in your garden, everyone has a different practice place. Don't chose somewhere where other members of your family often are, such as the main family room as your family members may get annoyed if you are always dancing in front of the television.; , A perfect place for finding instruction is YouTube. Start by watching videos on how to do pirouette turns or any other moves you think look nice. Of course, without proper lessons it will be hard to know whether you are doing the moves correctly but the first thing to do is to master some good turns or tricky positions.  Practice at home with your dance and you will be learning more and more. Try to create good facial expressions to match the mood of your dance.  These will often show you the correct foot and arm positions for turns or ballet steps. Be sure to use these tips and perform the correct positions in all of your moves. This will make your dancing more impressive to watch.  Below are stretches that will help you.  Slowly stretch down as far as you can go. This stretch should finish with your palms on the ground, head looking back through your legs. Hold it for five seconds, gradually moving up to thirty. Repeat this exercise with your legs together. Instead of palms on the ground your hands should be comfortably resting on your feet.  It is much like the first two except many people find it harder and you are sat down with your legs straight in front of you. Stretch over and attempt to grab your toes. Once you can do this, see how far past you feet you can go.  Flexibility is essential to a gymnast, which is why you need to be stretching daily.  This looks impressive. You simply do a handstand, arch into a bridge and stand up. It is obviously a lot harder than it sounds but it looks impressive if pulled off correctly. Practice with a friend spotting you, doing handstands against your sofa. When you are good, arch you feet until they are on the sofa. Then, kick over until your feet are on the ground. Once mastered, try this without the sofa. The last part of this move is the recovering when you need to stand up which is hard. But try, try to try again and eventually you will succeed! Only do these if you are with someone who can do them and knows what they are doing!  , The splits also make a routine look good, so practice the splits each time you stretch and you will gradually improve. Do not push yourself too far otherwise you could pull or even tear a muscle.  If you really want to get good at dance try practicing at lunchtimes with a good friend who also wants to dance. Some schools or work placed have dance rooms and most have empty rooms you can use at lunch times. Be sure to ask about them.  Most schools have free dance groups and joining them will give you extra dance training and also maybe the opportunity to perform at events with the school.  You could leave that other club that is on the same night as dance, or leave a club you don't particularly like and use the money to pay for your dance lessons instead.  

find a space in your house where you will be able to practice contemporary dance frequently.  learn moves and stretches to help you become a contemporary dancer.  try to choreograph a dance to a piece of music on your phone or laptop once you've learnt some good moves.  look up online classes on youtube.  if you want to be serious about dancing, you need to be stretching about three times a day to gain and maintain your flexibility.  stand with your legs shoulder width apart.  complete the next stretch.  if you want your dances to look more impressive, then gymnastics can be incorporated into the choreography.  know how to do a good handstand lumber.  learn how to do the splits.  practice at school or work.  consider joining a school dance group, if you are still in school.  if you feel you really want to dance, then maybe you need to devote some time to it. 

 Cribbing is often associated with boredom, so consider turning your horse out more with some other playful horses. Or, make his stall more interesting with some stall toys or constant access to quality forage. However, if your horse has been cribbing for a while, he may prefer to crib than play or eat.; , These can be purchased at your local tack store, and are attached tightly around your horse's upper neck. They prevent your horse from breathing in very deeply, so he can no longer get the effect he seeks when he cribs. When he finds that there is no way to get high, he will stop chewing. However, he will never be cured, so he has to wear this collar whenever he is in his stall or turned out (if he cribs during turn-out). Be sure to remove the collar he is exercising, though, or he could potentially suffocate.  These are quite simple: just scoop the right amount onto his feed once or twice a day. You might still want to use these in conjunction with another method, though, to guarantee success.  They can't crib on something that isn't solid, and the bristles will give them a little reminder poke when they try to crib anyway. You could also try painting anti-chew treatment on the cribbed surfaces, or lining the surfaces with metal, as some horses find the metal uncomfortable to bite.  Due to the way they have evolved, horses have a psychological need to chew almost constantly, but they should not be chewing on something that isn't edible. , But don't try this with everything, as where their stall is might not be the problem.  

prevent boredom.  try a cribbing collar.  use an anti-cribbing feed supplement.  try making it impossible for your horse to crib by tying stiff brushes (brush side up) on your horse's usual cribbing areas.  as feeding forage ad lib is not always possible, try putting their hay into a hay net with really small holes to keep them chewing for longer.  another option is putting a muzzle on the horse while in the stall (except at meal times), which will make it virtually impossible for the horse to grab objects to crib on.  ,  if your horse is at the end stall in the aisle, trying moving him/her to a busier spot in the stable to prevent boredom. 

 It is not necessary for your hair to be freshly washed, but if you do wash your hair before styling it, you may find it useful to add some volumizing spray to it before you blow it dry.   You can apply some products after blowdrying your hair, so just be sure to follow the instructions of whichever product you choose.; , With your hands, use your thumbs along the sides of your head to help you separate the top third of your hair from the bottom. Use a clip to hold this section in place. To create the other two sections, simply separate the remaining hair into two halves with your left and right hands. Lay the left section over your left shoulder, and the right section over your right shoulder.   It is not necessary to clip these two bottom sections.  Starting with one of the two bottom sections, brush the hair with a paddle brush and then spritz the entire length of hair with a heat protectant.  Starting at the back of your head and moving toward the front, alternate between curling towards and away from your face. For the pieces of hair that frame your face, you’ll want to curl away from your face. Each curl should look like a little spiral.   Hold each strand on the wand for roughly 20 seconds. It could be slightly less time depending on the quality of your wand and the thickness of your hair. If your hair is fine or damaged, you may want to start at 10 to 15 seconds to see if that works for you. Curling away from your face means pulling your hair away from your face to wrap it around the wand. Curling towards your face means pulling your hair towards your face to wrap it around the wand. If your hair doesn’t hold curls well, as you let the curl slide off the wand, let it fall into the palm of your hand and hold it there until it cools off., Ensure that you cover all of your hair with hairspray. Fold your body over so that your head is upside down and your hair is hanging towards the floor, and then shake your head in a “no” motion as you spray your hair.  Run your fingers through your hair gently to mould the curls together and shape them into a look that you’re happy with.   For a slightly softer look, lightly run a paddle brush (a large, flat brush) over the top layer of your hair while also working it with your fingers until you get a look that you are happy with. This will make the curls look more natural.  

start with dry hair.  separate hair into three sections.  spray each section with heat protectant.  wrap 1- to 2-inch sections of hair around a 19mm (3/4-inch) curling wand.  spray your hair with hairspray.  tame the curls. 

 Over worked, under appreciated, vain, fighting with their significant other about who was more put out by the last DMV appointment, desperately looking for some small evidence their work has meaning. You have two sentences, max, to cajole, seduce and entice. Lead with them.; , Tell your reader how you know them, why you love their work and how their existence in the world has affected yours.  Do not start sentences with “I…” The reader doesn’t care about you or your story. Sorry. The good news is that it’s not personal. The reader *might* hire you but only *if* they have more work than they can handle *and* some surplus cash that is worth less to them than getting some help. See, it’s not about you.  Ask for an honest portfolio review. If you are serious about working for a particular firm, you need to be looking 3-5 years out. Go in as a disciple and get honest, brutal feedback about where your portfolio needs to be in order to come back a few years from now. Tell them up front this is what you are after! However, show up dressed to impress and ready to shine. If you’ve got the chops now, they will work you in or pass you onto a friend in need of help. If not, you know your work isn’t there yet… yet. Your foot is in the door and you have a clear idea of what you need to work on.All portfolio review interviews are good. If your idol turns out to be an ass you’ve saved yourself years of prepping for a job you wouldn’t want. If you find them a mensch, joy all around! They will remember you and reward your hard work. Anything in between is good interview experience and well worth your time.  Jobs happen when you follow up. Send thank you cards, send emails, send postcards. Diligence counts. Be gracious and thankful, even to the asses. Why? At the end of the day it’s about the person you are, not the work you do.  

consider your reader.  get your story straight.  it’s not about you.  do not ask for a job.  thank them and keep in touch.

 Close your blinds before you take them down to make it easier. If you have several sets that you will be cleaning on the same day, label them lightly on the bottom with a pencil. Wipe off the pencil after you’ve hung them back up.   Don’t ever soak cloth or wooden blinds.  Fill the tub until there are about six inches (15.24 cm) of water covering the bottom. Add three to six drops of liquid dish soap. You can also add about one cup (240 mL) of vinegar if your blinds are really dirty.  Add 3-4 tablespoons (44.36-59.14 mL) of bleach to the hot water in your tub. Don’t add dish soap or vinegar. Wear gloves when working with bleach and keep children and pets safely away from the tub., Swish the water around your blinds to agitate the soap and water. Use a soft brush, sponge, or rag to rub down the blinds if they are especially dirty. Let them soak for about an hour. After an hour, drain the tub and thoroughly rinse all soap from your blinds.This will work with faux wood and metal blinds.  After rinsing the blinds, give them a gentle shake to remove extra water. Lay them on clean towels and pat them dry. Next, carefully hang them back up and let them thoroughly air dry while they are open.   Repeat the soaking and drying methods for all sets of blinds you need to clean.  

take down your blinds.  get your tub ready.  try using hot water and bleach to clean white blinds.  lay one set of blinds in the tub.  dry your blinds. 

 Before purchasing check local codes to ensure that you can use a portable fire pit.   Every city is different and yours may have certain codes which only allow a certain type of fire pit. Get in contact with the planning offices in your area to see if any restrictions apply.  Your deck or porch may not be the best place for a fire bowl. Drifting embers can ignite surrounding wood, cause heat damage, and ventilation issues.   The best place to put a fire bowl or portable fire pit is on a flat, stable, non-combustible natural surface. Bricks, gravel, granite, paving stones and concrete are great options. Put the fire bowl a safe distance away from your home, deck, overhangs, trees, etc. Don’t put your fire bowl near heat sensitive plants, dry grass, bales of hay, open firewood, and other materials that could ignite. Clear the area around the bowl of any sticks, twigs, leaves, or other flammable substances. Keep a bucket of water nearby.  The easiest way to get a fire going in your portable fire pit or fire bowl is to sort your wood, kindling, and tinder.   To help you build the best fire, sort your materials by size. Place all of your large logs together, followed by your smaller logs, kindling, and tinder. If you plan to cook any food over your fire, don’t use any starter logs or gels. These items contain chemicals which get into the smoke and can get on your food. Make sure that you use dry wood. If there’s any moisture in the wood, especially the larger logs, it will be harder to start your fire. You can easily find tinder in your own yard from dry grass and leaves that you rake up. Otherwise, newspaper works well. It’s also a great idea to have water or a bucket of damp sand on hand for putting your fire out.  Everyone likes to build a fire a certain way. With a fire bowl or portable fire pit, the teepee method or upside down fire method tend to work best depending on how deep the bowl is.   To make a teepee, start by placing your tinder in the bottom of your bowl. Keep your tinder in a ball and lay your kindling around it. Stack the larger sticks around your tinder in the shape of a teepee. You can then place your larger logs around your kindling. Keep a little open area so you can easily reach in and light your tinder. For an upside down fire, place the largest logs in the bottom of your pit, and spread the logs out to cover the base. Stack your smaller logs in a criss-cross pattern over your largest logs to allow for airflow. Place a small pile of tinder on top and then stack your kindling around the tinder in a teepee fashion. Never use pressure treated wood. Avoid using sappy wood like pine and cedar as these woods tend to pop more and create more floating embers.  Be sure not to overload the fire pit with wood, don’t stack it much higher than the rim of your fire bowl. When lighting your fire, the safest way is to use a long match or lighter. Light your tinder and watch the fire grow.   You may want to light your tinder in a couple places to help the fire get going. Shove some newspaper between your logs to create more heat and build up the flames. Softwoods such as pines and firs are easier to light and are good for getting your fire started. As your fire begins to burn it will create coals and embers. When the flames begin to die down, add larger logs to keep your fire burning. If your fire bowl has a grate cover, place this over your fire once it's going. This will help prevent embers from flying out.  After the initial ten or twenty minutes, most of your kindling will have burned up along with your tinder. These bits of material will start to form natural coals and embers which still provide plenty of heat.   Use a poker or large stick to move your coals and embers together. Add some oxygen by blowing on the coals to add more heat. You can now start to place larger logs on top of these coals to keep your fire going. Hardwoods like oak, ash, cherry, maple, and poplar are great for adding to a hot fire.  Once you’re done enjoying your fire pit, properly put out the fire.   If possible, allow the fire to burn down completely to ash. Pour water over the fire and make sure you drown all of the embers. Keep pouring until you don’t hear any more hissing. Stir the ashes and embers. A shovel works well here. Once everything in the pit is wet and cold, you can use the shovel to scrape the materials out of the pit. In most areas you can dispose of your ash in your regular garbage. Check with your local municipality for any specific laws or codes in your area.  

check with your local municipality to make sure you can legally use a portable fire pit or fire bowl in your home.  place your fire bowl in a safe place.  gather your materials for a fire.  place your materials in your fire pit.  light the fire.  maintain your fire.  put out your fire.

 If someone continues to violate the boundaries that you have asked them to respect, it’s important to stand up for yourself. Of course, it’s important to remain respectful, in the interest of keeping the peace as much as possible.For instance, feel free to say things like, “I’m always happy to see you David, but we need some time to ourselves tonight. I’ll let you know the next time we’re having guests over.”  , Sometimes, establishing and trying to maintain boundaries can lead to conflict between your values and those of one of your family members. Further, you may both become invested in arguing about your perspective, in part because you want an issue to be resolved. However, sometimes it is simply best to walk away and let tempers cool down.This is especially important when a family member is hard to talk to about things like healthy boundaries. It may take several conversations to get through to them. Remind yourself that other people’s anger is not a reason to compromise on your values. You may even want to say something like, “I understand that you’re upset, but I’ve been very clear about how I feel about this and I’m not going to change my mind simply because you’re angry. Let’s talk about it again when we’re all a bit more calm.  If a boundary that you are serious about maintaining continues to be violated, you may need to spend less time around the violating party for a while.For instance, if you’ve spoken to someone about drinking less around your kids but they continue to over-serve themselves, you may need to ask them not to visit your home, and/or avoid visiting theirs. Though this may feel cruel, it’s more than fair to give someone the time and space to decide whether they are willing to adjust their behavior to respect a fair boundary that you request.  

be firm and respectful.  remove yourself from an escalating disagreement.  reduce the amount of time you spend together.

 Products that are packaged in larger packages typically use less packaging per product than smaller packages. Check this out the next time you are shopping.; , Choose to buy items that use no packaging or a minimal amount of packaging. For example, buy apples from a bin rather than wrapped up on styrofoam with plastic around them.  This helps to promote recycling.  Most things made from recycled products advertise this fact, so that you know you are helping the environment when you purchase them.  Keep a recycle bin or bag in your home to place plastic, paper and cans. Carry these recycle items to your recycling station. Some towns offer curb side recycling.  You can also use newspaper and other biodegradable items to make compost.  Use these bags in place of plastic or paper bags that will be thrown away. Reuse the cloth bags each time you shop.  Sometimes, 1 person's trash is another person's treasure. This is a wonderful way to recycle items.  An example would be to wash and reuse plastic containers rather than using plastic baggies and throwing them in the trash.  For example, make a pencil holder out of a metal can.  Soft drink bottles sometimes offer a deposit for returning to the store. Computer ink cartridges can be returned and refilled.  Avoid throwing items away unnecessarily. Borrow items that you might only use occasionally. Try to fix an item rather than throwing it away, or see if someone else can fix it for you.  You will save money in the long run and keep these items out of landfills.  Talk about reducing solid waste in the schools and at community events. Promote ways to reduce solid waste in public service announcements on the radio and television.  

purchase items in bulk.  analyze the size of the packaging for the products you buy.  buy items that are packaged in recycled cartons.  choose to purchase items that are made from recycled products.  recycle items rather than sending them to the landfill.  place food scraps in a compost bin.  carry cloth bags to the grocery store or market.  give items to charity or sell in a yard sale rather than throwing them away.  find a way to reuse items rather than throwing them away.  reuse items for a different purpose than originally intended.  check to see if the packaging you are about to throw away can be returned for refill.  pick up only what you need.  recharge batteries rather than using disposable.  teach others about the benefits of reducing solid waste. 

; ,, Most landlocked areas selling fish usually have two types of fish - thawed or frozen, unless it is an upstanding vendor who really likes freshness.  It should bounce back when touched.  A "fresh" fish should not smell "fishy", but should have the odor of the ocean - such as a fresh ocean breeze.  If the head is on, fresh fish should have clear eyes, no cloudiness should be present. They should bulge a little.  If whole, they should be bright pink/red and wet, not slimy or dry.  Fish fillets and steaks should be moist and without change of color  , If the meat separates from itself it's not fresh. 

go to a reputable store or fishmonger.  ask what is the freshest or check what the catch of the day is.  ,  don't be misguided by the term "fresh.",  look for firm, shiny flesh.  sniff the fish.  check the eyes.  check the gills.  check cuts of fish.  on fillets and steaks, look for flesh separation and gaps.look for discoloration, brown or yellow edges, and a spongy consistency, these are all signs of aging fish. 

 Perhaps the most important decision is what material of doll hair you want. One factor to consider is the type of doll you are attaching it to. Is the doll made of fabric or plastic? Are you placing new hair onto the doll, or replacing hair? If you are replacing hair, you may want to replace the same type of hair that was removed.Yarn hair is often used on fabric and knitted dolls. It will match with the doll's appearance and will be easier to stick on the doll's head. Synthetic hair is what you see on most collectible dolls, and plastic dolls like Barbie dolls. It looks like real human hair but is synthetic material. You should be able to find synthetic hair and yarn at most craft stores. Synthetic hair may be slightly harder to find, however, so you may have to order it online.; , Once you have a material chosen for your doll hair you need to decide what you want the hair to look like. Length is an important factor. Will your doll have short hair, medium length hair, or long hair?   Yarn hair is more often used for medium to long lengths but is sometimes used for short hair.Synthetic hair is versatile and comes in any type or length. Think about the type of doll you're making, or the doll whose hair you're replacing. A baby doll may have shorter hair than a doll that's supposed to be an older age. If you're making a doll that's meant to look like a particular character, you should make sure your doll's hair matches the character. If you're making a Rapunzel doll, for example, you'll want your doll to have very long hair.  The next question for your doll’s hair is style. Do you want to curl your doll hair, leave it wavy, or straight? Some doll hair material is easier to curl than others, and some doll hair looks better straight or wavy.   Yarn hair usually comes as a straight fabric but you can curl it by wrapping it around a small wooden dowel and setting it aside for a bit. When you unwrap the yarn, it should be curly.You can create almost any look with synthetic hair. You can buy synthetic hair that is already waved, curled, or braided from a craft store or online.  To make the process easier it is a good idea to have all your materials purchased and ready to go when you make your doll hair. This way you will be well prepared. You can make your doll hair without interruption and admire your finished product. You will need:   A pair of scissors A sewing needle or a sewing machine Your desired doll hair material Scotch tape Flexible measuring tape A hot glue gun (for yarn hair) Tacky glue (for synthetic hair) Tissue paper A DVD case (for measuring yarn)  

decide what material is right for you needs.  decide what length your doll hair will be.  decide what hairstyle your doll will have.  gather your materials. 

 Your cat may benefit from a cat food that’s specifically made for hairballs. This food contains ingredients that are supposed to help the hairballs move through the cat’s body so it won’t gag or vomit them up.You can ask your vet for a formula recommendation or find one online or at a pet store.  If your cat is gagging due to too much hair, start brushing it more often. Try brushing its fur daily to remove loose hair. This may reduce the amount of hair your cat ingests when it grooms.You may also want to wipe your cat’s coat with a damp cloth to remove any loose hair the brush didn’t get.  You can talk to your vet about getting a laxative or other digestive aid that will help the hair and hairballs pass more easily through the digestive tract. These products contain some type of lubricant that helps hair avoid getting stuck., Hairballs can lead to gagging. Hairballs occur when your cat can’t digest the hair it has swallowed while grooming. To help reduce gagging and get the hair to go through your cat, try mixing one to two tablespoons of canned pumpkin into your cat’s food. This food has a lot of fiber, which can help your cat push the hair through.Olive oil is another food product you can try. Add one teaspoon of olive oil to the food. This can aid in digestion, which can reduce gagging. You can add these foods once or twice a week to your cat’s food.  

try a hairball formula cat food.  brush your cat’s fur more often.  give your cat a digestive aid.  mix foods that aid with digestion into your cat’s food.

 To use the medicine ball alphabet workout as a core exercise, you want a large ball that you can easily hold with two hands. The weight of the ball depends on your personal level of fitness, but generally should be between 5 and 15 pounds.Make sure the ball you choose is one that you can hold out in front of you with arms extended, and move it around without struggling. If you find your back hunching or your shoulders crunching inward, try a lighter ball.  Do this exercise standing with your feet about shoulder-width apart, or maybe a little wider. Firm up your quads and bend your knees slightly so they don't lock up – you want to keep a little bounce in your knees.Hold the medicine ball between both hands with your arms extended in front of you. The ball should be at about chest height.  Engage your core, and start tracing each letter of the alphabet in cursive with the medicine ball. Typically you can keep the shapes better if you let your dominant side "lead," but try to move your arms at the same time.Use your abdominal muscles to keep your torso as still as possible while your arms are moving around. Make sure you're not hunching over, and keep your back and shoulders neutral.  To turn your medicine ball alphabet workout into a mobility challenge, increase your range of motion so that you're making larger letters in front of you with the medicine ball.Move your whole body to make the letters as large as you can. Imagine that you are also using your torso to write the letters as well. You may want to start with a lighter medicine ball than you were using for the previous exercise, as the increased range of motion can be more challenging.  

choose a larger medicine ball.  get in the correct stance.  trace the alphabet.  make larger letters.

 There are a number of things involved with winning the right way, and much of it has to do with fairness and honesty. To win the right way, you must:   Refuse to cheat Play by the rules Be honest about your actions and the actions of other players Listen to the guidance and rulings of your coach and the referee; , One of the most important things about being a good winner is not gloating or bragging when you do win. The other team is aware that you won! You don’t have to rub it in.Avoid saying things like:   “Haha we won and you lost!” “You're terrible players, and that’s why we won” “We kicked your butts”  , Remember that the other team just lost, and they need some encouragement right now. They don’t need you being rude, because they already feel bad for losing.   Being kind and polite to your opponents applies at all times, including before, during, and after the game. Even if you think you'll beat them, are winning in the middle of the game, or just won, you still have to be nice. This means no trash talking the other team, no making fun, and no telling rude or mean jokes., Part of being a good winner means appreciating your opponents’ efforts and skills, and you can show this by complimenting them.Imagine how you'd feel if you just lost. Wouldn’t you like to hear the other team say how well you played?   For instance, you can say something like, “You guys played a great game, and I really like how well you work as a team.” At the end of the game, whether you won or lost, you can tell your opponents “good game!” You can also do this in the middle of the game. If one of your opponents makes a great move or play, say something nice about it., Even though the other team lost, it doesn’t mean that they're bad players, and you shouldn’t make them feel like they are. And even if they lost by a lot, you should never make fun, laugh at, or make jokes about the other team or any of the players.   Instead of poking fun, you can try offering tips or suggestions that might help them improve their game. 

win the right way.  don’t gloat.  be polite to the other team.  compliment your opponent.  don’t laugh at your opponent. 

 Place the list next to your grid. You can label your words #1, #2 etc. if you want to. Write your words out clearly so that the person doing the word search knows exactly which word he or she is looking for.  Put one letter in each box. You can write them backward, forward, diagonally, and vertically. Try to evenly distribute the words throughout the grid. Get creative with your placements. Make sure to write all of the words that you have listed next to the grid so that they are actually in the puzzle. It would be very confusing to be looking for a word in the word search that isn’t actually there.   Depending on who you are giving the puzzle to, you may wish to make your letters larger or smaller. If you want your puzzle to be a little less challenging, like if you are giving it to a child, you might consider writing your letters larger. If you want your puzzle to be more challenging, make your letters smaller.  Once you have finished writing in all the words, make a photocopy of it and highlight all of the hidden words. This will serve as your answer key so whoever does your puzzle will be able to see if they got everything right (or can get help if they are stuck on one word) without the confusion of the extra, random letters.  Once you have written all of your chosen words into the puzzle, fill the still empty squares with random letters. Doing this distracts the person from finding the words in the search.   Make sure that you do not accidentally make other words out of your extra letters, especially other words that fit into your theme. This will be very confusing for the person doing the puzzle.  Only do this if you are planning on giving your word search to more than one person.  

make a list of your words.  write all of your words into your grid.  create an answer key.  fill in the rest of the blank squares.  make copies. 

 In a large bowl, mix together the sifted flour, salt, baking powder, nutmeg, and sugar until evenly combined.   You could try using other spices, as well, including cinnamon or allspice.Use up to 2 tsp (10 ml) cinnamon and 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) allspice. Similarly, you can use spice blends that combine nutmeg and spices with similar flavor profiles, but you will need to vary the amount based on the proportions of each spice used within the blend. Mix the ingredients together with a mixing spoon or whisk.; , Sprinkle the cut butter over the surface of the dry ingredients. Use a pastry blender or fork to cut the butter into these ingredients, continuing until the butter is evenly dispersed and until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs.   The butter must be softened and cut into small cubes before you add it to the dry ingredients. Instead of simply stirring the butter into the other ingredients, you need to press the butter into the ingredients so that it can come into contact with the dry ingredients at a better pace. This is easiest to accomplish with a pastry blender or fork. If neither of these options is available to you, you could also use your hands.  In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk until well-blended. Add the vanilla and whisk again until it, also, is evenly combined with the other ingredients.   For a slightly different twist on the traditional flavor, consider using coconut extract instead of vanilla.  Form a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour the egg mixture inside this well, then gradually mix the dry ingredients from the sides of the well into the center. Continue mixing until the wet and dry ingredients are fully combined.   You could also try adding the wet mixture a little at a time, mixing after each addition. Form a well in the middle of the dry ingredients and pour one-third of the egg yolk mixture in the center. Mix completely, then add another one-third and mix again. Repeat with the remaining egg mixture.  Turn the dough out onto a clean, lightly floured surface and knead the dough by hand several times, just long enough for it to become smooth and somewhat elastic.   You should also lightly dust your hands with flour as you work with the dough. Otherwise, they might stick and create more of a mess.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or place it back into its bowl. Place it in the refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes.   If the dough seems firm enough, you might be able to skip this step, especially if you can work fast. Chilling the dough allows it to harden up a little, which can make it easier to work with in the long run and less likely to stick to surfaces.  Place the chilled dough on a clean, lightly floured surface. Use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough out until it is an even 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) thick all the way around.   Try to keep the dough in the shape of a rectangle as you roll it out. If there are uneven edges, use a knife to trim them away before cutting the main part of the dough into pieces. The scraps of dough should be re-kneaded together and re-rolled after you form pieces from the main portion. Cut additional pieces from these scraps once you roll the scraps back into a workable form.  Use a knife or pizza cutter to cut the rectangle of dough into strips that are roughly 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) wide. Cut the dough crosswise into another set of 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) strips, ultimately forming 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) squares.   You could make the pieces a little bigger, if desired, but keep in mind that larger pieces will take longer to cook.  Cut the dough into 2 inch (5 cm) squares. Cut each square in half diagonally, then poke a small hole in the center of each triangle. Carefully pull one corner of the triangle through the hole, forming a knot.To form 2 inch (5 cm) squares, cut the flattened rectangle of dough into 2 inch (5 cm) strips with a knife or pizza cutter. Cut another set of 2 inch (5 cm) strips crosswise, forming the squares.  Heat on high until it reaches a temperature of 350 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).   The saucepan or skillet you use must have a heavy bottom and deep sides to prevent as much hot oil splatter as possible. Check the temperature of the cooking oil using a candy thermometer or a frying thermometer. If you do not have a thermometer, you can check the approximate temperature of the oil by tossing a small piece of dough into it. If the oil immediately begins to sizzle, the oil should be ready.  Add the chin chin pieces to the hot oil one handful at a time. Fry for 3 to 8 minutes, turning only as needed, until the pieces turn golden-brown on all sides.   The small squares will usually only need 3 to 5 minutes. They may not need to be turned during the cooking process, either. The knots may need a bit longer, from 6 to 8 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or tongs to gently flip them over once, after the bottom begins to brown, so that both sides will cook evenly. Watch the temperature of the oil as you cook the chin chin. It may rise once you remove the pieces and lower once you add them. For best results, adjust the temperature controls on your oven to consistently maintain the temperature of the oil at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).  Remove the fried chin chin using a slotted spoon. Place them on a plate lined with clean paper towels to drain off the excess oil.   Repeat the frying and draining steps until the entire batch has been cooked.    Strictly speaking, chin chin should be fried and not baked, so you cannot get a fully accurate taste by baking them. These baking instructions will give you something as close to the traditional taste as possible, though, and are a decent alternative if you are looking for a healthier, oil-free method of cooking the chin chin. Avoid using aluminum foil. If necessary, though, nonstick cooking spray can be used instead of the parchment paper.  Place the chin chin pieces on your baking sheets in a single layer. Transfer the pans into your preheated oven, then bake until the tops begin to turn slightly golden.   Make sure that the pieces are kept to a single layer and are not touching. The pieces will stick together if they touch while baking, and they will not cook evenly if they overlap one another.  Flip the pieces over using a spatula. Continue baking them for another 15 to 20 minutes, or until both sides have become golden brown.  Remove the chin chin from the oven when done and allow them to cool slightly for 3 to 5 minutes on the baking sheet.   The pieces should not be allowed to cool completely. You simply want them to be cool enough to handle.  Chin chin are often sprinkled with a little sifted powdered sugar. Transfer the pieces to a serving platter and dust the tops with sugar before presenting them to your guests.   An easy way to dust the chin chin with powdered sugar is to use a small sieve. Hold the sieve above the chin chin and place the sugar in the sieve. Gently sift the sugar through the sieve and onto the pieces of chin chin below.  At this point, these delightful pieces of crunchy-chewy dough are ready to eat.  

combine the dry ingredients.  cut in the butter.  combine the eggs, milk, and vanilla.  gradually combine the the dry and wet ingredients.  knead the dough.  chill the dough.  roll out the dough.  cut the dough into small squares.  alternatively, create knots.  heat the oil in a deep saucepan.pour 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) canola or vegetable oil until a medium skillet or saucepan.  fry the chin chin in batches.  drain on paper towels.  preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit (190 degrees celsius).prepare two large baking sheets by lining them with parchment paper or wax paper.  bake for 10 to 15 minutes.  flip and continue baking.  let cool slightly.  dust with powdered sugar, if desired.  enjoy. 

 On a cloth sheet, draw a rough sketch of a good-sized rabbit, modeling it on the regular Easter bunny. Draw the rabbit standing on its hind legs, and holding its paws as if it were carrying an egg.; ,, The eggs should be as large as the space between the rabbit's paws. In each egg stick a pin.  Each egg is to be pinned on the sheet, and right in Bunny's arms, if possible. As the players take their turns, no matter how straight on the way they were started, Bunny will be surrounded with eggs, until a player pins the egg in Bunny's arms. The player who is closest to the arms, or spot on, wins a prize.  

draw an easter bunny shape.  stretch the sheet on the wall and tack it firmly in place.  ,  cut eggs out of different colored cloth to represent easter eggs.  blindfold the players in turn and give each an egg. 

 Like in many other disorders, sleep is one of the foremost symptoms of a nervous breakdown. You may toss and turn getting to sleep and may wake up several times throughout the night. You may find yourself sleeping far too much or far too little than you usually sleep.Sometimes it is difficult to get back to sleep due to racing thoughts and excessive thinking. Though you may feel a need for sleep and feel constantly tired, getting a good night's rest becomes more and more difficult with each passing day.  If you’ve significantly let your hygiene slide, it may be due to extreme stress. You may lack any motivation to take care of your body. This may include failing to shower, use the restroom, brush your hair or teeth, or change your clothes. Perhaps you’ve been wearing the same clothes for days, despite visible stains. You may wear socially inappropriate clothes in public., Physical symptoms of intense anxiety can lead up to and sustain during a nervous breakdown. If you tend to experience anxiety and then experience a major life event, it can trigger intense symptoms of anxiety that can feel immobilizing.Take note any symptoms of anxiety, which include:Tense, clenched muscles Clammy hands Dizziness Panic attacks  , You may feel completely lacking in energy. Feeling constantly exhausted or fatigued is another common symptom, as all of your energy is being channeled into coping with the crisis you're experiencing. Even small, everyday activities can feel like massive hurdles to overcome.Even basic daily activities such as showering, eating, or even getting out of bed may feel like too much energy to complete.  When experiencing intense stress as a result of a nervous breakdown, you may feel your heart pounding, a tightness in your chest, or a lump in your throat. Despite this, medical testing will not reveal any problems with our heart, as the symptoms are purely stress related., An upset stomach and digestive issues are common stress and anxiety-related problems. This is due to the fact that when you are extremely stressed, your body goes into survival mode, and digestion is not at the top of the priority list., Shaking hands or whole body trembling is one of the most obvious physical symptoms of a nervous breakdown, and one of the most embarrassing. Unfortunately, the embarrassment caused by the trembling and shaking only increases your stress levels.Trembling and shaking may be physical manifestations of all the stress your body and mind are experiencing.  

take note of any sleep disturbances.  examine your hygiene.  recognize extreme anxiety.  reflect on feelings of exhaustion.  look for a racing heartbeat.  think about whether you've had any problems with digestion.  identify any problems with trembling or shaking.

 If you’re putting your name on your work, you should think carefully about what you put out into the world. Remember that once a story is out of your hands, anyone can read it. Especially if you’re a younger writer, your parents may be upset if they find out you’ve written a steamy romance scene. Even if you’re an adult, you may still wish to protect your friends or children from steamier romance scenes.; , Romance scenes can range from innocent first kisses to raunchy eroticism. Whenever you write a romance scene, you have to imagine how your reader will respond to it. If you’re writing a YA (young adult) story for teenagers, you need to consider how comfortable your readers will be with explicit sexuality. Even adult readers may prefer more romance than raunchiness. On the other hand, if you’re writing for an audience who’s come to the story for the bodice-ripping, then you want to give them what they expect from the genre.   Many romance publishers have specific guidelines for how "steamy" a romance scene can be, depending on the imprint for which you're writing. For example, romance publisher Entangled has a "Bliss" line that focuses on romance but does not show sex scenes at all, but their "Brazen" line focuses heavily on sex scenes and allows for more graphic writing.If you aren't sure about the appropriate "steam" level, read your publisher's submission guidelines. If you don't have a publisher yet, having a look at guidelines is still helpful, as it will help you gauge your book toward current market trends.  Even if you're writing fanfiction about well-known characters from a book or movie, you are placing them into a world of your creation. Spend a long time thinking about these characters and their relationship. What is the baggage in their relationship? How will each of them have imagined this scene before it happened?   The more time you spend thinking about how your characters will feel in the moment, the more realistic the scene will be when you write it. Think about how the characters feel about this scene. Are they tense? About to explode from anticipation? Shy?, It also has to have some sort of consequence on the plot of the story. Why does this interaction matter to these characters? What will change for them?   Are one or both of the characters already entangled in a different relationship? Do they know that they will be separated soon? Does the reader know they will be before the characters know? Should the reader the feeling that the characters will regret this romantic interaction? Is this interaction a way to express feelings that the person isn't otherwise able to voice?, You shouldn’t write a romantic scene just for the sake of writing a romantic scene. It should further the development of the plot in a meaningful way. Now that you've considered what's at stake in the scene, spend some time thinking about what will happen after the scene. Consider if there are any details you want to foreshadow in this scene that will make the reader have a stronger emotional reaction later in the story.For example, in many romance novels the romance scenes provide the conflict and ways for characters to grow. A cop who has trust issues might learn to become more vulnerable in the bedroom, or a timid schoolteacher might learn to take charge of what she wants in the romantic interactions., If you can give the reader a clear sense of what's around these characters, you bring the scene to life for them. Before you even begin writing the interaction, spend some time brainstorming the setting. Think about what details the characters may notice before, during, and after their romantic interaction. Consider including a few details that might mirror the romantic mood, but don't get too cliched. In fact, some decidedly non-romantic details might make the scene more realistic.   Romantic details might include the soft light at dawn or dusk, the sound of a babbling creek, or the scent of a lavender candle. Less expected, non-romantic details might include the the sound of a child crying in another room, complete darkness that keeps the characters from seeing each other, or the smell of dinner burning in the kitchen. You may want to consider your setting in terms of what is realistic for your characters. Most people don't have time to light candles and get soft background music playing unless it's a really special occasion., Your story may be told entirely from the point of view of a single character or narrator. In that case, you don't have a decision to make. But if your story jumps back and forth between different characters' points of view, you have to decide who gets to tell this part of the story. What's important is that you give a full, thorough telling of the experience. For that reason, it's best to focus on a single character's experience, even if you have an omniscient narrator.Jumping back and forth between what your two characters and thinking and feeling can feel clunky and confusing.Present one character's full experience of the scene. If you want, you can show the other character reflecting on the experience in a later scene. Some publishers may require that romantic scenes be presented from both your protagonists' points of view.If this is the case, don't repeat the same actions or events from both POVS. Instead, for example, you can switch from someone doing an action to the other character reacting to it.  Even if you've never been in a situation like this, there are little details from different experiences that could bring your scene to life. For example, even if you've only been kissed once, what details were you paying attention to? If you remember worrying about your palms sweating, or that this was a bad song to have a first kiss to, maybe your character can think that too.   Readers want to see a scene that they can relate to. If you write something purely imaginative and idealized, it won't feel attainable or realistic to them. If you have no romantic experience, don't fret! Ask your friends about their experience, or re-read and watch your favorite romantic scenes. Use "exaggerated awareness" when considering the scene. The characters should experience the scene in a heightened way so that the readers can, too. Don't forget to use senses other than sight! What smells, sounds, and physical sensations do your characters feel?, Romantic scenes can get out of hand pretty quickly. It's okay to want your characters to be heavily invested in the scene. But if every detail of the kiss is bursting with superlatives (the sweetest kiss, fire running through your veins), there can be no building of tension. Your scene should be like real life: there's a lot of buildup to the moment of greatest tension. Your heroin's bosom shouldn't start heaving the moment the hero enters the room. Maybe she just feels the light heat of flushing skin.   If you have multiple romantic scenes in the story, remember that every kiss can’t be earth-shattering. The reader will no longer respond to the description if it’s repeated too often. Just like in real life, there should be many types of kisses: quick goodbye kisses, sweet kisses to the top of the head, lingering kisses, and, yes, earth-shattering kisses every once in a while.  You should begin layering the levels of romantic tension before the reader even realizes that this scene will turn romantic.   Begin by describing the characters' moods. Even if they're not feeling particularly romantic, the mood adds to the character of the romantic interaction. For example, an angry protagonist will kiss differently from a sad protagonist. Think about how the dialogue will lead to the climax of the scene. What do the characters say to each other that ends up with them locking lips? What setting details might add to the romantic tension? Bring in some of those details you brainstormed earlier.  To recognize it, you have to read a lot. Unfortunately, this can't be done quickly. For good writers, reading is part of everyday life year after year after year. Once you've read enough romance scenes, you'll be able to pick up on the language that seems overly familiar. "Earth-shattering," "heaving," "fire," "tingling" — these are all examples of language that a well-versed romance reader will yawn over. You want to present this scene in a way the reader has never seen before. If a description comes to you too easily, there's a chance it's because you've heard it before. Be ruthless! Always look for the most original language.   Part of the problem with cliche language is that it's not concrete. Readers want to be able to imagine themselves in the romance scene. Specific, descriptive language is much better than vague, meaningless cliches. For example, "His kiss was earth-shattering" doesn't really say anything about how the kiss feels. Compare to this: "He slid his hands into her hair, sending a spark of electricity down her spine. As their lips met, she sank into the warmth of the kiss with a sigh." See how much more evocative that is of what the character is experiencing?  , But on the screen, the screenwriter has actors giving emotion to everything that’s implied on the page. Without a skilled actor to give body to your intentions, you need dialogue to help the reader imagine what’s going on. The dialogue helps nudge the scene along — it should always serve a purpose.   Feel free to write grammatically incorrect sentences. Even if your English teacher would mark it in red, nobody speaks perfectly correctly — especially when emotional. Speak the dialogue out loud, maybe with a friend playing the other character. If the dialogue feels stilted and unnatural, keep tweaking it until it feels realistic., The physicality of a romance scene should develop in the service of the emotional arc. Details about what a character’s hands are doing are wonderful, but they should only be included to lead to how they make the other character feel. What are the emotional connotations of rough hands versus soft ones? Kissing a person’s lips versus biting them? Always follow physical descriptions with their emotional repercussions.   A good love scene will not be a play-by-play of "then he touched her there, and then she touched him, and then...and then...and then." You want the actions to flow together, but you don't need to narrate every tiny detail. Focus on how the interaction feels to get the biggest impact.  

consider what you’re comfortable writing.  keep your audience in mind.who will be reading the story in which your romance scene occurs?,  think about the relationship between the characters.every romance scene is unique because they occur between two specific characters at a particular time in their lives.  set the stakes for the scene.the reader wants the scene to be more than a purely physical interaction.  consider how the scene fits into the surrounding story.  describe the setting.the setting can almost be a third character in a romance scene.  choose the point of view, if necessary.  include realistic details.when writing any scene — but especially a romantic scene — you should always think about similar experiences in your life.  don’t oversell the interaction.  build tension with pacing.the romantic scene should begin before the characters ever touch each other.  avoid clichéd language.the best way to avoid cliched writing is to be able to recognize it.  use dialogue to develop the scene.in the movies, you might see a romantic scene with no dialogue.  develop emotion over physical sequence.you might think readers want to read about the physical kissing and touching, but what they really respond to is the emotion of the moment. 

 Read more on the solar cell they are interested in using and read up on panel design techniques. Basically the solar cells must be mounted inside a housing which has to be sealed from the elements to prevent dust and condensation from forming on the cells which will reduce the power output severely.; , If you are designing for a specific device, read the label on your device or its power supply; this will specify the voltage and watts required to charge your device. If you are trying to design a charger for multiply devices, you must use the maximum voltage and wattage of the most power hungry device in your target group. - it will require a sizable panel to charge multiple device simultaneously. If this is your goal, design the charger to produce 110 or 220, whichever is your normal power line voltage. Then just use the standard chargers and plug them into the panel - this will save you a lot of design time for making multiple d.c. voltages available for different devices, it will also give you more flexibility in adding future device.  Different battery chemistries require different charging techniques. This wiki explains some of this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle_charging.  if each cell is .5 volts and you tie 24 cells together like this, you will have a panel that is wired in series and produces 12 volts (24 x .5) - this does not multiply wattage/amperage, only voltage. So if your cells output .5 volts and 10 watts, your panel will output 12 volts and 10 watts. To increase wattage you tie multiply panels together using parallel wiring, in parallel wiring you tie the "+" wires from the other panels together and the "-" wires together with the "-" wires from the other panels - do not tie the plus and minus together or you will short out your panels. So if you tie two panels together (each panel is wired in series) in parallel, you will now have an output of 12 volts and 20 watts. You use this technique to combine cells into panels to produce your desired output voltage/amperage/wattage per your spec. 

start small until you understand what you are doing and work your way up.  ascertain exactly what your power requirements are.  if you are designing for a single voltage/wattage combo, i.e. 12volt 12 watts, the conversion of watts to amps is governed by the equation amps = watts/volts:  for example, 12 watts/12 volts = 1 amp - so there is your design spec, you need to build a device that will output 12 volts - if you want to charge the device directly from the solar panel without using the power adaptor that came with your device, you also need to understand what sort of charge cycle your battery requires.  read up on parallel and series wiring - which is not very complicated - basically if you tie the "+" of one solar cell to the "-" of the next solar cell and repeat this your voltage will be a multiple of the number of cells tied together - i.e.  if you are building an ac voltage panel, add an inverter which converts d.c. to a.c. and supplies a clean sine wave so that any device you plug into the panel will operate properly.  

 If your vehicle has a carburetor (a device that mixes air and fuel) and it will not start, check the choke. If your choke is closed when you try to turn the vehicle over, open it. If it was open when you try to turn the vehicle over, close it.Adjusting the choke is also a good idea when your car has a carburetor and starts, but then turns off. If you cannot locate your choke, consult your vehicle’s user manual.  If your car has a hard time starting on rainy days, look inside the distributor cap. If you see moisture inside the distributor cap, turn the cap upside down and spray it with mechanic’s solvent (or, if you have a bottle of solvent rather than a spray can, pour some of the solvent into the cap). Swish the solvent around, then pour it out. Use a clean rag to wipe out any additional solvent before replacing the cap.The distributor cap is a small cover that protects your car’s distributor.  If you don’t even hear a sputter when you turn the ignition, the terminal cables to the battery are probably not connected properly. If the terminal connections look corroded, jam a screwdriver between the connector and the terminal post. Twist the screwdriver to tighten the connection. Try the engine. If it starts, clean or replace the battery cables.When adjusting the connector and terminal post, use a screwdriver with an insulated or wooden handle.  

adjust the choke.  check for moisture.  check your battery.

 During the final weeks of pregnancy, many women take time off from work and have more time on their hands. This is a wonderful time to make memorabilia so that you and your child can look back at this important time in both of your lives.  If you haven’t already started a pregnancy journal or scrapbook, this is a great time to put one together. You can purchase one at a store or make one on your own from a blank book. Be as creative as you want to be.   Just because it is a journal does not mean that it only has to contain writing. Paste in ultrasound pictures, cards and other things that you have collected during your pregnancy. In the same manner, a scrapbook can also contain journal entries whether they are written directly in the scrapbook or written on a piece of paper and glued in.  Another thing that you can do is write a letter to your unborn child. This letter can be saved and given to your child, or read to your child, when he or she is older. A letter is wonderful expression of love and the joy you are feeling about having your baby.  

understand why making memorabilia is a good idea.  put together a pregnancy journal or scrapbook.  write a letter to your new baby. 

 If you try to file your dentures yourself, you risk damaging them beyond repair. As dentures are expensive, you risk losing a large amount of money if you try filing them yourself. It's always best to ask your prosthodontist or dentist to adjust them., Some people do not like the length of certain teeth on their dentures, and they use a nail file for this purpose. Lightly rub it against the teeth you want to shorten, filing on the point or edge of the tooth. However, be sure to make small adjustments. You don't want to go too far when filing your teeth because it's difficult and expensive to repair them after you've filed too far.As you file them down, keep stopping to check how far you've filed. Try not to go to far. Clean the dentures before putting them back in your mouth and checking your adjustments.  Sometimes, your dentures will dig into your gums because they don't fit properly. They may also have small tags leftover from manufacturing. Some people use rotary tools to make adjustments. Make sure to keep it on a very low rotation. The heat of a high rotation may damage your dentures, although any kind of repair can damage your dentures.Identify where the problem is. When you have the dentures in, pinpoint exactly where they dig into your gums. Try to be very precise and gentle. Take them out of your mouth. Use the rotary tool to gently rub against that area, filing it down. Make sure to only take away a little at a time. Be sure to clean the dentures before putting them back in your mouth and testing the adjustment. You can use a fingernail drill, for instance, or a crafting rotary tool. Use a bit that will let you sand off edges, such as a round- or oval-shaped bit.  When you first get dentures, your mouth needs time to adjust to the new teeth. To help your mouth out, you can use dental adhesives to hold them in place for the first few days. Eventually, though, the muscles in your mouth should adjust to keep your dentures in place, so you should only need to use them for a short time. Adhesive is helpful when you have pain as it holds your denture still in your mouth. Movement against an already sore spot will lead to an ulcer.   You an also use adhesives as a temporary measure when they start to become loose after years of wearing. However, you need to have your dentist reline your dentures when they become loose, so you should only use the glue for a short while.Every adhesive is a bit different. However, in general, you take the dentures out of your mouth and clean them. Shake some of the powder onto the gum side of the dentures. Put your dentures back in. Cream adhesive must be applied to a dry denture in order to work, rinse your mouth and then place denture onto a wet gum and wait five minutes before eating or drinking anything.  One option some people use for helping to relieve pain, especially with new dentures, is to place them in the freezer. When you take them out, the cold will help soothe the pain in your gums., Creams such as benzocaine topical can provide temporary relief from pain. Simply rub the cream on the painful area in your mouth, and it will numb the pain. Baby teething gel is available in most supermarkets. There are much stronger medications available, but if cost is a problem, or accessibility, then the baby gel is a good option. It is very safe and gives reasonable relief to sore spots on your gums., If other options don't help, go ahead and take your dentures out for a bit. That will at least provide pain relief. See your dentist for help.  

know the risks.  try a nail file.  file off tags with a rotary tool.  try dental adhesives.  put your dentures in the freezer.  try a pain cream.  remove your dentures.

 Research online and download a template or create your own. You may use a design program like Adobe Illustrator to enlarge your design. Print your design on stencil decal vinyl either using a Cricut vinyl plotter or Graphtect Vinyl plotter. If you do not have these tools, you may also simply print out your design on paper., Clean your metal with a rag and solvent to remove any grease or debris. Whether using stencil decal vinyl or paper, place your design on your 16 gauge metal. Use a soapstone pencil or a sharpie marker to trace your design onto the metal., Use a plasma cutter and keep the tip around ⅛ of an inch from the metal. Be careful to create a nice clean and smooth cut. Make sure the work area is well lit and well ventilated. Wear the proper safety gear including goggles, gloves, and protective eye gear.If you are using a normal 110v outlet, you may use a Hobart 250ci Plasma Cutter.  Slag will be produced on the bottom and top of the metal when using the plasma cutter. Use your angle grinder to remove any slag. Clamp down your tree and use a 60 to 80 grit flap disc to clean the edges.Use the 80 grit flap disc to create the illusion of bark by grinding the surface of the tree. Remove blotches of film from the metal with the grinder for a bark like look.  Using a ¼ inch drill bit on the leaves, create holes so that you are able to dangle earings. You may experiment with slightly larger drill bits to hang special bracelets.  Bend your tree using a pry bar or a chisel so that it is able to stand vertically. Create a flap at the bottom of the trunk by clamping down your tree to your workbench and allowing a bit of the trunk to hang over your table. Then use the chisel or pry bar to bend the overhang towards the ground., Use the plasma cutter to cut a 6 x 4 inch shape from your 10 gauge steel. Create a heavy base. The shape you choose is completely to your preference., Use a clear quick setting epoxy on the flap of your tree to attach it to the base. Clamp the base of your tree down to the base for an hour or two to let the glue dry.  Create dimension and character by bending leaves and branches. Clamp your tree down and use a chisel or pry bar to bend your leaves. When done shaping your piece, use a few thin coats of solvent based metal sealer to seal the entire jewelry tree.Purchase solvent based metal sealer at your local hardware store.  Avoid scratching surfaces by adding some felt pads to the bottom of your piece. Add earrings, necklaces, and other jewelry to your finished tree.

 To determine how best to order your priorities and manage your time, it is important to figure out what your values are first. Try taking some time to examine what matters to you and what you want to achieve over the course of your life. Some questions you might ask yourself include:What makes me happy? What are my natural skills and abilities? What do I want out of my life? What do people say I am good at? What might I regret if I go my whole life without trying? What do I have strong beliefs about? What do I value most in my life?; , Consider the things in your life that keep you so busy. Think about which of these things are the most important and which could be cleared out of your life as excess clutter.Try writing down all the things you do in one day to give yourself some perspective on what is making your life so busy. For example, if you get coffee on your way to work every day, this might be a thing that just adds to your sense of busyness in your life. Consider making coffee at home every day so that you can feel like you have a little more down time.  When you have a busy life, it is important to fill what little free time you have with things that make you happy. One of the best ways to do this is to spend time with people who are important to you.Try to make the most of your time together by dedicating yourself to the quality time. Don’t try to answer emails while you spend time with your family or friends. Do that later. Be present in the moment. Even though it might be hard to carve out the time, try to prioritize this. Try scheduling a fun activity that everyone will enjoy. Make dinner plans with your parents or take your kids to the park. Go to a movie with your friends or schedule a night out with your favorite colleagues.  Incorporate things you are passionate about into your life. If you have to lead a busy life, it should be filled with things you are passionate about whenever possible. Go after a job you love or engage in hobbies that make you happy.Being passionate about what you do will make your busy life seem much more fulfilling. A good way to do this is to choose something you are passionate about that you have to practice daily. If you love playing golf, incorporate that into your life as your relaxation activity. If you love reading, join a book club or become a teacher. That way, you might be busy reading, but it’ll be doing something you love.  When your life is busy, you always feel like you have a million things to do. In order to love your busy life, you need to figure out how to prioritize the things that matter the most so that you always complete the most essential tasks.This is especially important when you’re feeling overwhelmed. Focus on one task at a time, starting with the most important. Then just work your way down the list. If you feel like you have too many things to accomplish on a daily basis, you should write down your “to do” list with the most important things at the top. For example, you could list unavoidable work commitments first, followed by family functions and social obligations, and list everything else after. This will help you put your to do list into perspective so you can see where certain things might be able to be cut out.  Many people fill their lives with things – cars, homes, furniture, clothes, etc. – because they think it will make them happy. But usually these things just end up being empty possessions. If your life is busy because you are working too much so that you can afford more things, consider simplifying your life so that you can focus more on things that truly make you happy – like spending time with people you love or going on new adventures.Instead of buying a new car, spend that money on a vacation with your family. Creating memories with people you love is a better way to enjoy your busy life than spending money on something you don’t necessarily need. Try to minimize your desire for possessions and downsize the possessions you already have. If you have a closet full of clothes you rarely wear, donate some of them to charity. Sell or donate all your kids toys or clothes they’ve outgrown.  If you are having trouble enjoying your life because it has gotten so busy and hectic, then you might need to schedule in some time for yourself to just relax. Try to treat relaxation and self-care as necessary things that you need to fit into your everyday life. Some things that you can do to relax and take care of yourself include:   Practicing a relaxation technique such as yoga, meditation, deep breathing, or progressive muscle relaxation for 15 minutes every day. Making plenty of time for self-care, such as taking a bath, getting your hair done, giving yourself a manicure, or preparing a healthy meal for yourself. Doing things that you enjoy such as knitting, watching a favorite TV show, reading a book, or playing with your pet.  While being so busy with our work, we often forget to enjoy our beautiful lives. It isn't that hard to embrace the life you have. Just live in the moment, live for today, and focus on the small things (at least some of the time) like laughing at the jokes you hear while doing your work. These things will help you to enjoy every bit of your life, even when you have a busy one. This means not holding on to grudges or staying upset about something that happened yesterday. Forget about how mad you are at your mother and move forward. Call her and smooth things over. Appreciate things as they happen to you. Recognize when good things happen and be grateful instead of taking them for granted.  This can also be called "me time." Take a few quiet minutes with yourself away from your busy schedule. Contemplate the things that make your life so busy and whether or not they are really necessary. Reflect on what’s really important and consider whether or not you can cut out some of the things that make you so busy.Being busy means that your life is full of things and people you have chosen. So, even though your busy life can often be stressful, it is also a blessing.  Spending dedicated time with your friends and family will definitely keep you happy and make you appreciate your life even if it is a busy one. Besides, this way, it won't bother you to have a busy life because you’ll be enjoying it with people you love when you’re able to.If you have to get some work done while you’re away with your family, dedicate a specific window of time to this task rather than just working constantly off and on all day.  When our lives get busy, it’s easy to focus on what we don’t have because we feel like we are working so hard. You might find yourself thinking things like, "Oh! I don't have this" or "Oh! I don't have that." Stop complaining about what you may not have or haven't done yet. This kind of negative attitude won’t help you enjoy your life more.Take a breath and be contented with what you have, or with what you have done so far. Remember that you might complain about your busy life while others might be so jealous of the life you lead. Keeping this kind of perspective will make help you be more satisfied with yourself, as well as your life.  Besides "me time," make a habit of reminding yourself to be grateful at least three times a day. When you wake up, be thankful for being able to live for another day. When you notice yourself thinking negatively, pause for a moment to take stock of your life and think about what you have to be grateful for. Consider all the things you take for granted on a daily basis.During your lunch break, be grateful for having a job while others are in need of one. At night, be thankful for each of the tasks you completed. This will bring a huge change in life.  Having a busy life probably means that you are busy working towards a goal of some sort. Whether your goal is planning for retirement, getting your kids through college, or working toward the life of your dreams, it’s important to keep the end goal in mind so that you can stay focused and on the right track. This will help you love your busy life.Set realistic, positive goals for yourself and plan out how to achieve them. This is a step-by-step process that takes time. But working toward your goals will lead to more satisfaction with your busy life. 

identify your values.  figure out your priorities.  make time for people you love.  pursue your passions.  prioritize your to do list.  focus on people, not things.  make time to relax and take care of yourself.  live in the moment.  spend a few minutes alone.  take a vacation.  find contentment.  be grateful.  focus on goals. 

 The more you know what the collection agencies can’t do, the better you protect yourself.; , They hate having to do anything that doesn’t involve them getting your money. And a collector, who’s trying to scam you into paying a debt you don’t owe, hates it when you don’t just give them your money.  Here, you make sure the creditor/collection agency has the legal right to collect the debt rather than asking the creditor/collection agency if you actually owe the debt.  Since the debt collectors want to get as much money from you as they can, and since the average person isn’t trained in negotiation like a lawyer, they figure they can get more money from you if you aren’t represented.  If the court finds them guilty of violating the FDCPA, the collector will be fined $1000 per violation and may have to pay your attorney fees and court costs.  Wouldn’t that make them happy?” Sometimes yes. However if you’re sure you owe the debt, and you pay on the debt, nothing will make a collector madder. They want to be able to continue being able to add interest, late fees, and penalties to your account. If you pay off the account, they lose the chance to make more of a profit. So do everything you can to pay off the debt as soon as you can.  

know your rights: every state and the federal government have laws designed to prevent debt collectors from harassing consumers.  validate the debt: every collector, especially those that are trying to scam you, wants you to just pay on a debt.  verify the debt: verification is a lot like validation.  consult a lawyer: like with validation/verification, debt collectors hate it when a lawyer or a law firm gets involved.  sue the collector: if the debt collector violates the fdcpa (fair debt collection practices act) you can sue them.  pay the debt: you’re probably asking “how is paying on the debt going to make a debt collector mad? 

 You want the contract to be easy to read, so make sure that you set the font to a comfortable size and style. Times New Roman 12 point is fairly standard.   You can also play around with bold and larger font sizes if you want to emphasize certain portions of the contract.; , At the top of the first page, you should center “Artist Recording Contract” between the right- and left-hand margins.You can make the title a little larger than the rest of the type.  At the beginning, you should identify the artist and the recording company. You should create the contract as a template that can be used more than once. To do so, you should insert blank lines for the date and the artist’s name.   Sample language could read, “This agreement made of between (‘company,’ ‘Record Label,’ or ‘Recording Company’) and (‘artist’).”, Recitals are the “whereas” clauses that describe the general nature or background of the contract.You will want to include recitals that describe the desires of each party. It is standard for recitals to be fragment sentences.   You could write: “Whereas the parties desire to enter into a contract whereby the artist will record songs for the recording company and that company will try to market the songs for a period of 12 months starting with the date this agreement is signed. Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual benefits and obligations contained in this agreement, the following agreement is made.”, The contract might contain terms you need to define because they would not be understood by the average person. If you end up in court in a contract lawsuit, you will want the judge to understand how you are using terms. Accordingly, you should define any terms you don’t think are clear.   One term you will definitely need to define is “territory.” The record label gets rights to only certain territories. When signing a new artist, the label usually defines the “territory” as the entire world.More established artists will try to get separate contracts for different territories, such as North America. You might want to save this step for last. Once you finish a draft of the contract, you can then go back through it and identify unclear terms.  An artist needs to present you with some songs before you agree to market him or her. Accordingly, you should explain the initial recording obligation. For example, a recording company might require that the artist cut a minimum of five songs using the company’s master sound tracks. You should explain how the costs of recording these songs will be charged back to the artist.   For example, you could write, “The artist is under a ‘recording obligation’ for the next 12 months. The artist will fund the initial cost of presenting him or herself to the record company with a minimum of at least five songs, recorded using company master sound tracks. If the record label signs the artist, then further recording obligations will be at the label’s expense. However, the artist must understand that all monies furnished to the artist will be charged back to his or her account. All of the money will be recovered from the artist’s publishing, record sales, personal appearances, corporate sponsorships, and product sales of all kinds. There are no ‘free rides’ in the music business, and all costs are recoupable by the company.”, You might not charge back all expenses to the artist. If not, then identify those costs which you won’t charge back. For example, you might not charge for the following:   manufacture of the single record on compact disc mailing, labor, and postage related to mailing the single to all radio reporter stations service and re-service costs in-house label promotion  , You might get a deal for an album from one of the major labels or major independent record labels during the 12-month term of the contract. However, the contract might have expired before you can record it. You should include a provision where the artist agrees to come back and record the album in this situation.   For example, you could write: “Artist may be called back to record at least one album on behalf of the record label after the contract period expires should the company have a contractual offer in hand from one of the major labels or major independent record labels. This obligation is called the artist’s ‘overcall album.’ The company may exercise an option at any time the company has written offers in hand. The ‘overcall album’ shall be completed subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement. Artist will be provided with sufficient notice of the option being exercised in writing at least 30 days prior to the notice of time to appear to record.”, During the term of the contract, you don’t want the artist recording or performing for anyone else. For this reason, you should include a term where the artist agrees to be exclusive to your recording company.   Use a clause like this: “Artist agrees that during the period of this agreement that he/she will not perform for any other person, firm, or corporation for the purpose of producing commercial sound records. Artist also agrees that after the expiration of this agreement not to record for anyone else any of the musical selections recorded under this agreement, and that in the event of a breach of this covenant, the company shall be entitled to an injunction to enforce same, in addition to any other remedies available to it at law or equity.”, Legally, you can get the artist to agree not to record a contract or promote a recording for another label for a certain amount of time after your contract ends. You should expect the artist to push back on this, but you can include it in your template:   “Artist warrants not to perform or license or consent to the use by or exploitation of any phonograph record or recording by the artist for another record label, management company, or producer for a period of 12 months subsequent to the expiration or termination of this agreement.”, The artist or the artist’s music company will probably pay you a deposit in order to record the initial tracks. You should identify the amount of the deposit in this section.   For example, you could state, “Artist has paid a deposit to the recording company in the following sum: .”You can also identify the method used (such as wire transfer, certified check, etc.) and where the money was sent (i.e., the name of your bank).  The artist needs to pay the remainder of the costs for recording before you will begin a recording session. You should explain the details.   For example, you could write: “The artist must pay the balance of the recording contract 72 hours prior to the session being called. The recording date is scheduled for . The total cost of recording the complete project, less the amount of deposit, will be .”, You want to spell out clearly whether the artist can get a refund on their deposit or fees if they need to cancel a recording session. For example, you might write:   “The artist cannot cancel a session without giving the producer, or company representative, written notice at least 10 business days prior to the recording session. If a session is canceled, the deposit is nonrefundable. However, it may be applied to another date.”, To prevent disputes from arising after recording, you should explain who will own the recorded tracks. It is standard for the record label to hold all rights to the music when the artist is a novice. More established artists can negotiate to gain control of the music after a certain amount of time.   You could write, “All sides recorded during the terms of this contract shall be recorded by the artist on the record company’s behalf. All records or discs made therefrom, together with the performances embodied therein, shall from the inception of their creation be entirely the property of the record company in perpetuity, through the territory, free from any claim whatsoever by the artist.”, You should also explain in the contract that you have the sole rights to use the recorded songs throughout the territory you agreed to, as you see fit. With this clause, you are basically telling the artist that you will control distribution, not the artist.   For example, you could include this distribution provision: “The record company shall have the sole and exclusive right to use the sides throughout the territory or any part thereof in any manner it deems fit, including without limitation the sole and exclusive right in perpetuity and throughout the territory to manufacture, advertise, sell, distribute, lease, license, or otherwise use or dispose of the sides.”, The artist will expect a certain percentage of the sale of each CD or digital downloads. You need to include provisions which address how royalties are paid. Be sure to include information about domestic royalties and international royalties.Most recording labels pay a lesser royalty amount on international sales than they do on domestic sales. If the artist has a lawyer, then you should expect to negotiate the royalty rate.To understand what is a standard royalty rate, contact other record labels or meet with an experienced lawyer in the music industry.  You want to protect yourself from an artist who steals another person’s work but presents it to you as original. In that situation, you could be sued for copyright infringement.   For example, you could include this covenant: “Artist covenants that he/she has the sole right to record such original songs without any restrictions whatsoever. Artist further warrants that he/she has not entered into any written, oral, or other binding agreement of any kind prior to recording such songs on behalf of the record company.”, By agreeing to this provision, the artist agrees not to sue you for any misunderstandings in the agreement. Obviously, including this provision won’t entirely prevent lawsuits. However, it can be helpful to have.   You might write: “Artist agrees and warrants to hold the record company ‘completely and totally harmless’ from lawsuits, and litigation of any kind whatsoever, that might proceed from any misunderstandings spelled out or not spelled out in this agreement.”, You can agree to arbitrate any disputes that arise under this contract. Arbitration is like a trial except it is private. You present your case to an arbitrator instead of a judge. Alternately, you could include a provision that you will mediate any dispute with the help of a mediator.   “If a disagreement does arise, then the parties have agreed in this contract to seek binding arbitration for their differences outside the bounds of a lawsuit and before an arbitration panel made up of people within the music community who understand the legal aspects of each and every facet of this agreement.”, Many young artists have stars in their eyes and imagine that fame and wealth are automatically guaranteed because they have signed a recording contract. You can include some provisions which explain to the artist that the music industry is risky.   For example, you could have the artist promise to the following: “The artist covenants that he/she is not basing a decision to record on any intangible or fraudulent promises, dreams, or incentives given him/her by the producers, company, or management firm. It is the reality of the music business that the artist is taking a chance at recording and may or may not ever be signed to a major label in the future.” Also, you can have the artist warrant that no one is guaranteed success: “The artist understands and warrants that no one can guarantee ‘superstardom’ in the music industry. Only a small percentage of acts signed to the major labels go on to achieve superstardom.”For extra emphasis, you can set these provisions off in bold type.  Near the end of the contract, you want to explain how the contract can be terminated and what grounds can trigger termination. Generally, you will want to give yourself the power to terminate the agreement if the artist breaks any provision in the contract.   For example, you could write: “If artist is in material breach of any material term or provision of this agreement, or if the company determines that artist’s ability to perform as a recording artist has become impaired, then in addition to all other rights and remedies available to the company at law or equity, the company shall have the following options: (1) to terminate this agreement at any time, whether or not artist has commenced to cure the default before such termination occurs; (2) to suspend the company’s obligations to render accounting statements or payments to the artist until such time as the artist eliminates the default or condition; and/or (3) require artist to repay to company the amount of any advances not yet recouped.”, This clause states that the contract contains the entirety of your agreement. Any prior agreements are merged (and superseded) by the written agreement. You want this clause so that the artist doesn’t sue and claim that you had a prior oral agreement that isn’t included in the contract.   A sample merger clause might read: “This contract contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the matters contained herein. It may not be modified, waived, or supplemented except in a writing signed by all parties.”, If you find yourself in a contract dispute, then the judge will have to interpret the contract using a state’s law. You can decide which state’s law you want to use. Generally, companies pick the law of the state where they are located.   A choice of law provision could read: “This contract shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Tennessee, excluding that State’s choice-of-law principles, and all claims relating to or arising out of the contract, or the breach thereof, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall likewise be governed by the laws of Tennessee, excluding that State’s choice-of-law principles.”, You should clearly lay out each party’s address. Don’t put this information under the signature blocks. Instead, you can insert it before the signatures. Make sure that you have the following information for each party:   name address daytime telephone evening telephone fax number email address  , It is common for many different people to sign a recording contract, so you will probably need five signature lines. Just above the lines, include the following: “In witness whereof, all of the following parties have caused their legal signatures to be affixed in agreement this .” You should have a signature line for each of the following people:Record Label Representative Management Company Producer Co-Producer Artist or Artist’s Music Company Representative  , The contract may be signed in front of a notary public. If you want the contract notarized, then include a notary block. You can find an appropriate block for your state by searching the Internet.  This is only a basic recording contract. After you have completed a draft, you should show the contract to your lawyer. He or she will look it over and tell you if you need to include anything else. Contracts usually have to be modified according to your particular business needs.   If you don’t have a lawyer, then ask other recording companies who their attorney is and whether they would recommend their attorney. You can then call the lawyer and schedule a consultation. Take your sample contract with you.  You can negotiate the terms of the contract. Let the artist and the artist’s lawyer (if there is one) look over the contract. They may write comments on the draft and send this draft back to you.Your lawyers may have to talk with each other to negotiate compromises on some issues. Make sure that each side agrees to the entire contract before signing it.  After everyone has signed the agreement, you should make at least one copy for each person who signed it. Also keep the original in a safe place, such as a safety deposit box.  

format the document.  add the title.  identify the parties to the contract.  insert your recitals.  include a definition section.  clarify the artist’s recording obligations.  identify costs which will not be charged back.  include an “overcall album” provision.  add an exclusivity provision.  add a non-compete clause.  identify any deposit the artist paid.  explain how the artist will pay the balance of the recording fees.  explain how the artist can cancel a recording date.  explain who owns the tracks recorded.  identify your distribution rights.  identify the royalty rate.  include a covenant that the artist’s work is original.  add an indemnity provision.  insert a dispute resolution clause.  include provisions that explain the music industry is risky.  include a termination clause.  add a merger clause.  insert a choice of law provision.  include the address of the parties.  include signature lines.  add a notary block.  show the contract to your lawyer.  give the draft contract to the artist.  distribute copies of the signed agreement.

 Before you start painting your sunflowers, you have to be sure that you have the paint colors on hand. You’ll obviously want yellow paint for the flowers’ petals, but it helps to have several different shades available so you can shade them to add dimension. For the center of the flower, you’ll need a couple of shades of brown paint. You should also have at least one shade of green for the stem and leaves.You can use whatever type of paint you prefer for painting; both oil and acrylics work well for painting on a canvas. Don’t forget the background of your painting. If you’re painting the sunflowers in an outdoor setting, you’ll need blue to fill in the sky or green to represent grass and other plants. For an indoor setting, you’ll want a background shade for the wall. It’s a good idea to keep white and black paint on hand. That way, you can lighten and darken up the yellow, brown, and green paints that you have to create additional shades for the painting.; , Finding the right sized brushes for your painting will depend on the size of the canvas that you’re using. With a standard size canvas, though, you can usually do the job with a ¼” brush for larger areas and a ⅛” brush for detail work.If you’re planning a large background for your sunflower painting, you may also want to have a wide, flat brush on hand. It will allow you to fill in the background shades more quickly than a ¼” brush.  While you probably have a pretty good idea of what a sunflower looks like, it always help to have a point of reference while you’re painting. Look for a photo of sunflowers online that appeals to you, and print a copy so you can refer to it while you’re working. If you are unsure of any of the flower’s details, you can consult the photo.If you have access to actual sunflowers, you can use a real flower as your guide. If there is a painting of sunflowers that you admire, such as van Gogh’s “Sunflowers,” you can use a photo of it to help inspire you.  If you want to paint the flower from the front, make a circle, using dotted lines rather than a solid line. For a sideways flower, create a thin letter “C” so the flower’s center has more of an oval shape.When you’re trying to decide how large to make your circle or “C,” take the size of the canvas into consideration, as well as many flowers you want in your finished painting. If you’re painting a single sunflower, you should probably make the center fairly large. If you’re creating a sideways sunflower, make sure to leave the oval open to create the “C” shape. You’ll use that open area to add petals.  Once you have the first sunflower’s center drawn, you can start to add the petals. The easiest way to create the right shape is to make triangles that have all of the sides slightly curved. Keep in mind that all of the petals don’t have to look identical, though. You’ll get a much more realistic looking sunflower if they’re all slightly different. Line the entire center with petals.Make sure to vary the length of the petals and to create some that overlap. For the best looking sunflower, create at least two layers of petals. You can have the tips of the back row just peeking out over the first layer. If you’re creating a sunflower that faces forward, the petals will fairly large. On a sideways facing sunflower, the petals near the open area of the “C” will be smaller than the others that line the center.  Once you’ve finished drawing in all of the petals, you can add the stem. Depending on whether you want to paint a sunflower that’s growing outside or that is cut inside a vase, you may want to create a stem that’s slightly curved near where it attaches to the bloom or one that is entirely straight. Have the stem go all the way to the bottom of the sketch.Let the size of the sunflower’s size help guide the thickness of the stem. Larger blooms require a thicker stem to support them.  To give your sunflower a more realistic appearance, it helps to add some leaves to its stem. You can place them wherever you like on the stem, but start with a curved line to create the top edge of the leaf. For the bottom edge, though, make the line slightly ridged so it resembles a real leaf.Depending on the size of your sunflower, it may be enough to add one leaf to the stem. However, if the stem is very long, you may want to add multiple leaves, placing them on both sides.  When you’re happy with the sunflower that you’ve drawn, you can decide whether you want to paint additional flowers. You can use the same techniques to draw them as you did for the original flower, though you’ll need to vary the size and the direction that they’re facing. Adding some in the foreground and others in the background can help give the finished painting more dimension.Keep in mind that background flowers will be smaller than the original flower, while those in the foreground should appear larger. You don’t have to add complete flowers. You can just sketch in top, bottom, or side of a sunflower to help fill out the painting.  Once you’ve finished your sketch of the sunflower(s), you need to transfer it to the canvas before you begin painting. The best way to transfer the sketch is with artist’s transfer paper, which is coated with graphite that transfers to the canvas when you trace over it. Take a piece of transfer paper that the same size as your drawing, and tape it to the canvas, with the graphite side face down. Place the drawing on top of the transfer paper, and trace it onto the canvas with a pencil.It’s best to use artist’s archival tape to attach the transfer paper and drawing to the canvas because it is easy to remove and doesn’t leave any residue behind. Make sure that you position your transfer paper and drawing on the canvas in the exact spot that you want to paint your sunflowers. A mechanical pencil usually works best for tracing the drawing because you don’t have to worry about the point getting dull.  After you transfer the drawing to the canvas as a guide for your painting, start by painting the background behind the flowers first. You can use the larger brush to fill in most of it, but take care around the flowers and other items that you might have included in the drawing, such as a vase. Around those areas, you may want to switch to a smaller brush.If you’re using multiple colors of paint to get the right shade for the background, you can usually mix them directly on the canvas. However, if you’re making a drastic change, such as taking a color extremely dark or extremely light, you may want to mix the paint on a palette first so you can be sure to get the right color.  With your smallest brush, start filling in the petals around your sunflower(s). In most cases, it’s best to start with your brightest yellow shade for this step. Next, use a similarly sized brush to fill in the center of the sunflower with a brown shade. Just as with the yellow, it’s best to start with a lighter brown or tan color.If you don’t have a yellow or brown shade in acrylic paint that is light or bright enough to use as a base color, thinning a darker color with water can help lighten it. With oil or acrylic paint, you can mix in some white to lighten the yellow and brown shades.  To give your painting dimension, you’ll want to incorporate other shades of yellow on the petals. Shade some areas with mid-tone and dark yellows so the petals don’t look as flat. Do the same with the sunflower’s center by working in mid-tone dark shades of brown.To decide where to use the darker shades, consider where the light would hit the flowers and where shadows might fall. Depending on the look that you’re going for, you may also want to incorporate subtle touches of red and orange paint in the petals’ shading. You can also use a small amount of white on the petals to act as a highlight. For the center, you may want to have some black paint on hand to darken certain areas.  The final step for your sunflower painting is to fill in the stems and leaves. You usually want at least two shades of green: a brighter green and a darker forest green shade. Use your smaller brush to fill in the stems and leaves to keep your strokes more precise. 

find the right paint shades.  choose brushes that are the right size.  find a photo of sunflowers for inspiration.  start with a circle or the letter “c.” to start your sunflower drawing, you should begin with the center of the first flower.  add the petals.  draw the stem.  mix in some leaves.  add more flowers.  transfer your sketch to the canvas.  paint the background first.  fill in the petals and center with a base color.  shade the petals and centers.  finish the stem and leaves. 

 This is the one ingredient you may not be able to pick up at the local grocer, but instead may need to hunt for it online or at a health food. If you purchase online, go through a reputable dealer and be sure you are buying, “food-grade.”; , Vanilla beans from the local grocer will work, but for about the same money, consider getting a little wild and crazy by hunting down the best special Madagascar vanilla beans or specialty beans. Just the difference in freshness will increase your vanilla’s flavor.  You will keep and mix your vanilla inside the bottle so make sure it has a cork or lid stopper.  This will be used to slice the vanilla beans to release their essence.  This includes cleaning out the glass bottle to remove dust or debris by using warm water and mild dish soap. Allow plenty of dry time before adding ingredients.   Make sure your paring knife is sharp and that you have a clean work surface.  If the bottle opening is narrow, you could use a plastic funnel for a neat pour.    The safest method is to place the bean on a clean, hard surface. Hold the top of the bean with one hand and then slice the bean using your other hand.  Carefully move the seeds into a spoon so you can easily transfer them to the bottle. These seeds hold a great deal of the flavor associated with real vanilla so save all you can.  Swish the bottle if the seeds attach to the sides.  Allow bottle to sit for at least six weeks before using. 

search for a food-grade vegetable glycerin.  buy whole vanilla beans.  find a large, 17-ounce glass bottle.  find a sharp pairing knife.  prepare supplies.  pour 16 ounces of food-grade vegetable glycerin into the clean glass bottle.  slice eight vanilla beans down the middle, exposing the seeds.  scrape the vanilla bean seeds away from the bean pod and into a pile.  transfer the seeds and empty bean pods to the container holding the glycerin.  add the bottle cap or cork and place in a cool, dark area.  finished.  

 Adjust your car and fasten your seat belt.  It is similar to an automatic, except it has only one gear. The options should be listed in this order: P, R, N, and D. Depending on the vehicle, it may have another option or two.  P is for park. This gear is designed specifically for parking a vehicle. R is for reverse, used for backing up a vehicle. N is for neutral. This is used when you do not need to change the speed of the car, or for coasting. Keep in mind: Coasting is illegal in many U.S. states, and should be avoided.  D is for drive, the option used for moving the vehicle forward. Operating a CVT is almost the same as automatic, except that with a CVT, you will never feel the vehicle shift - it is only one gear.  This allows you to press the button on the lever that allows you to select the gear you want., Many newer cars have cameras that drivers use to check how they have backed up the car., Before you shift to this from reverse, come to a complete stop., Then set your parking brake up. 

get into the vehicle.  look at the choices available with a cvt transmission.  put your foot on the brake.  when driving in r (reverse), check your surroundings for safety.  if you select d (drive), operate the vehicle like you normally do.  come to a full stop before shifting to p (park). 

 There are so many ways to put together a great trifle, all most cooks usually think about is -- what is the very best fruit I can grab at the supermarket. If you start with a wonderful, ripe fruit, you'll be making delicious trifles in no time. Try out:   Strawberry + Kiwi Orange + Cranberry Orange + Pineapple + Peach Peaches (with cream) Banana + Nuts Blackberries + Raspberries + Blueberries, Who doesn't love chocolate? You can create any layer you want with chocolate, or you can simply add another layer of delicious chocolate spreads or a sprinkling of chips on top. Try out:   Using Nutella or chocolate sauce in place of jam Making a chocolate chip layer Soaking the cake in chocolate liquor Drizzling chocolate sauce over the fruit, tossing to coat. Chocolate cake or brownies, instead of white cake, as the base, Anything that is mostly firm, holds its shape, and tastes great is a wonderful substitute for ladyfingers. Try, out these cookies, for example:   Nilla Wafers or ginger snaps (wonderful with banana) Oreos, Thin Mints, or other chocolate, crunchy cookies Pound or angel food cake Flavored breads, like pumpkin, banana, or cranberry breads Peppermint flavored candies, cookies, or cakes Toffee Other cakes, like carrot cake, This is perhaps the most frequently improvised part of the trifle, as you can use puddings, custard, or creams to get the same "point" across. For example, you could try:   Cheesecake filling, made by sweetening cream cheese and adding milk, whipping until a smooth consistency Mix your whipped cream with Bourbon or Irish Cream for a little kick Use caramel or Dulce de lech (usually in combination with cream).  Ready to get real crazy? Chefs across the internet have truly expanded a trifle to include just about anything, including:   Fun-sized candy bars and peanut butter cupsGummy worms or beats Shredded Coconut and pineapple -- go tropical! Candy canes + chocolate chunks  

think about the astonishing number of fruit mixtures you have on hand.  add a little chocolate to the mixture with cookies, syrup, or candy.  get creative with your "cake" base.  get a little creative with the cream filling, mixing in new flavors and ideas.  expand your definition of "fruit" for a more filling filling. 

 Gather parsley before the first flowers start to open, and gather it in the morning after the dew has dried. It will have maximum flavor at this time of day; the heat of the afternoon will diminish the parsley's flavor. Alternately, purchase fresh parsley at a grocery store. Choose bright green bunches of parsley that look nice and smell fresh. Don't pick parsley that is shriveled, brown, moldy, or is dried out. Carefully cut the parsley with stems still attached, and be careful to not bruise the leaves.  Use cold water to rinse, and then shake the parsley gently to remove excess water from the leaves. This will remove any residual dirt, as well as any bugs that crawled into your parsley.  Blanching is a method that scalds herbs, vegetables or fruit so that their color and flavor will last when they are preserved.To blanch the parsley, use tongs to dip sprigs of parsley into a pot of boiling water briefly and swirl them around. Pull out the parsley when the color brightens.   The blanching step can be skipped, but the parsley will likely have less flavor and may have a gray-green color.  This will stop the parsley from cooking after being in contact with boiling water. , Be careful not to overflow the ice cube tray with water. Alternatively, put the chopped parsley in small freezer bags. , Use within 4-6 months.  

harvest fresh parsley from your garden.  rinse the parsley.  blanch the parsley in boiling water.  cool the parsley by either running it under cold water or letting it cool in the air.  remove stems and finely chop parsley with a knife.  ,  pack chopped parsley into an ice cube tray and add a little water into each ice cube compartment.  freeze the parsley ice cubes for about 24 hours or until they are solidly frozen.  ,  store the parsley ice cubes in a freezer bag or airtight freezer-safe container. 

 As the job market becomes increasingly competitive, the hiring process is becoming more complex. More and more companies are turning to psychological (or personality) assessments to determine whether someone is the right fit for the job. Do some serious thinking about the qualifications that are necessary for the particular job that requires the test.For example, if you are seeking a job as an executive or upper-management, the interviewers will want to make sure that you have strong leadership skills and are an excellent communicator. If you are applying for a job such as a police officer, candidates will be expected to exhibit an ability to deal with high levels of stress and think on their feet.; , Psychological exams are essentially an assessment of your personality. Think about why you are applying for this job. It is probably because you feel that you are qualified and have the right disposition for this particular career.For example, if you are applying for a sales job, you know that a portion of your income will be generated by commission. Therefore, you need to be highly motivated. Does that sound like you? Reflect on your personality traits before the test. This will help you be prepared to formulate answers that fit the role. It's important that you be yourself when answering questions. But you should also remember that you are being evaluated. For example, if you were asked, "If you knew you would not get caught, would you steal from the company?", you should answer "No." Even if you know that you might consider stealing, that is not something you would want to say during an interview.  During the interview process, you need to not only highlight your strengths, but you need to convey how you can specifically benefit your future employer. Think about what you can do to improve the productivity of the company. If you are conscious of the company's needs, this will likely be reflected in your personality test.Before your test, feel free to ask the recruiter or HR representative what characteristics are most important on them. Then you can focus your answers on conveying those traits.  It is impossible to predict the content of the test. However, you can prepare yourself by getting comfortable with the format. Be aware that most psychological exams consist of a face to face interview and a written questionnaire.You can search for practice tests online. Make sure to choose one from a reputable site that has solid psychology credentials. You can also hire a consultant to give you an in person practice exam. This person will then provide you with analysis and helpful hints.  

think about the job requirements.  consider your personal characteristics.  know the company's needs.  take a practice test. 

 The more programs you have on your computer, the slower it will run. By deleting unnecessary programs, you can easily improve the efficiency of your device., Navigate to the "Uninstall Programs section. In windows 7, 8, 8.1, and 10, these settings are all in different places. You may have to search for the option if you don't see it immediately.  This will allow you to filter through your programs and find the ones you have not used in a while.  When you find a program that you no longer want, click Uninstall. (Be careful, if you don't know what something is, look it up first, often times some applications are necessary to run games.)

 You can soothe your skin using natural remedies at home, especially if you are uncomfortable using over-the-counter products. An oatmeal or baking soda bath can help to reduce inflammation on your skin and make your belly feel less itchy.To make an oatmeal bath, take a nylon knee-high. Fill it with steel-cut oatmeal. Then, tie it to the bath tub tap so the warm bath water runs through the knee-high. Soak in this relaxing, soothing bath for as long as you see fit. To make a baking soda bath, pour ½ cup baking soda to warm bath water. Soak in the bath for as long as you see fit. Try to use baking soda, not baking powder, as baking powder will not be as effective as baking soda.  Aloe vera gel can be soothing to irritated skin and is a good natural option for pregnant women. You can find aloe vera at your local drug store or online.   Wash your belly with water and dry it well before applying the aloe vera gel. Apply the gel on the itchy areas as often as needed. Make sure you wash your hands after you have applied the gel., Use a clean washcloth and soak it in cold water. Gently lay the compress over your belly to soothe the itchy areas. You may use a cold compress in addition to taking an oatmeal or baking soda bath. 

take an oatmeal or baking soda bath.  use aloe vera gel after you shower.  put a cold compress on your belly. 

 This way, there will be no risk of the mouse finding its way back.If you were to release the mouse in your yard or front lawn, it could easily sneak back in your house again.  Once you have successfully trapped the mouse (or it has fallen into your bucket trap), you need to move it outside of your home.   As a courtesy to your neighbors, you should also avoid releasing the mouse near another house or residential center.  Unfortunately, mice that were born indoors or have become used to living in a house are poorly suited to live in the outdoors.   Mice that are trapped and released outside may not live long in nature. 

take the mouse several miles away from your own home.  release the mouse outdoors.  understand that the mouse’s life may still be at risk. 

 There are many reasons why you may wish to contact your attorney. Understanding that reason is key to determining whether a letter is the appropriate course of action and, if so, to writing a letter that clearly communicates your message.If you merely wish to inquire about the status of your case, a formal letter is not necessary. Your lawyer is obligated to keep you reasonably informed about the status of your case and will likely contact you whenever there is news to report. If you have not heard from your lawyer in a while, send him a quick email or leave him a voice mail message asking for an update.If your lawyer has requested that you write him a letter, follow his instructions his exactly. For example, if he sends you a list of questions to answer, simply answer his questions one by one as clearly as possible. Do not worry about formatting the letter in any special way or typing it unless your attorney requests that you do so. If your lawyer has asked that you write him a letter giving your consent to his requesting documents on your behalf, you should ask your lawyer to write the letter for you. This kind of letter may need to meet certain criteria to be effective and your lawyer is the one who will know what the letter needs to include. Your only role should be to revise and sign the letter once you have received a draft. If you are concerned your lawyer is not working on your case, write him a polite but firm letter explaining your concerns. If you feel more comfortable emailing or calling him, that would be fine as well. You are under no obligation to express your concerns in a formal letter.If you want to fire your lawyer, send him a letter that clearly states you are terminating the relationship and that the lawyer is to cease working on any pending matters. You should also ask that he return all of the documents regarding your case and pay you refund for any unfinished work.; , Once you have confirmed that writing a letter will serve your purpose, write an opening paragraph that explains why you are writing and stating any questions or requests.If you wish to fire your attorney, state that clearly in your opening paragraph: "I'm writing to terminate our attorney-client relationship." If you have a legal question for your attorney, ask it up front: "I'm writing to ask you a question about my immigration case. I'm wondering how my departure from the U.S. will affect my legal residence status."  , Once you have explained your purpose, the proceeding paragraphs should explain your reasons for making a particular request or asking a particular question.   If you begin your letter with a paragraph stating that you would like to terminate your relationship with your attorney, write one or two paragraphs that explain why you are unhappy with him. Wherever possible, refer to specific examples. If you are writing your attorney with a question, provide your attorney with the necessary context for understanding why you are asking your question. For example, "The reason I am asking this question is that I'm planning to leave the United States next month to care for my mother who is sick."  , If you are making a request, be sure to repeat it in the final paragraph. This will remind your attorney of what you are asking from him.   For example: "For these reasons, I would like to terminate our attorney-client relationship and I ask that you return my file to me as soon as possible."  , Your main goal in writing to your attorney should be to communicate your message as clearly as possible. Do not worry about impressing your attorney by using big words or complicated sentences. You want to make sure your attorney understands what you are saying so that he can comply with your request.For example, instead of “enclosed herewith please find,” just say, “I’ve enclosed” or “Here is. . . .”  , Think about your purpose in writing the letter and include only the information necessary to achieving that purpose. Anything beyond the essential information could confuse your attorney and cause him to misunderstand what you are requesting.Avoid unnecessary tangents, like telling your attorney about problems you have been having with your wife, unless they relate to your case.  Either format is appropriate for a formal business letter.Full block format means that all elements of the letter are left-justified so that the start of each line is at the left-hand margin. Modified block format means that some elements of the letter are shifted over to the right.  At the top of the page, on either the left corner (if using full block format) or the right corner (if using modified block format) write out your address.If applicable, also include your e-mail address and cell phone number.  On the left side of the page, directly beneath your address, write the date of the day you are writing the letter.The date should be placed on the left regardless of whether you are using full block or modified block format. Write the date in word rather than number form, as in June 8, 2015 instead of 6/8/15. Allow for two spaces beneath the date.  On the left side of the page, two spaces beneath the date, write your attorney's full name and address.   Your attorney's name and address should be placed on the left regardless of whether you are using full block or modified block format. If there is a paralegal that is working on your specific case, you may wish to write to include it in parenthesis next to the attorney's name.  Beneath your attorney's name and address, on the left hand side, include a subject line referencing your case number.Highlight the subject line in bold so that it appears prominently on the page. If you don't have a case number, write out your name (or the name of the main client on the case) in the subject line. This will help the attorney and the attorney's staff locate your file.  By way of introduction, write out a phrase greeting your attorney by his last name.For example: "Dear Mr. Jones" or "Dear Ms. Fisher" Position the greeting on the left side of the page. Follow the greeting with a colon, i.e. "Dear Ms. Fisher:"  , If you have already prepared a draft of the letter, simply insert the text of that draft.   Lead with the main purpose of your letter and then explain the reasons for your question or request.Be specific when referencing relevant information including names, dates and places. The more information you include, the better your attorney will be able to assist you. Keep to one main topic per paragraph, even if you have several issues to discuss in the letter. End the letter in two or three sentences as politely as you can, even if your letter to your attorney is a complaint about the service you have received.  End the letter with an appropriate closing phrase."Sincerely" is an example of an appropriate closing phrase. Place a comma after the closing phrase (i.e. "Sincerely,"). The closing should be aligned with your address. If you are using full block format, place it on the left side. If you are using modified block format, place it on the right.  After your closing phrase, write out your full name.Align your name on the same side as your closing phrase. If you are using full block format, place it on the left side. If you are using modified block format, place it on the right. Insert several blank lines between your closing phrase and your name.  Print out the letter, then use a blue or black pen to sign your name between the closing (i.e. "Sincerely") and your full name typed name., Print an extra copy of the letter to keep for your personal records. That way, if the letter gets lost in the mail or your attorney denies having received it, you will have proof that you sent it.  

understand your purpose.  lead with the most important point.  fill in the middle with your reasons.  close with a paragraph that summarizes your main point.  use simple language.  keep it short.  decide whether to follow "full block" or "modified block" format.  write your address.  write the date.  insert your attorney's name and address.  reference your case number.  greet your attorney.  write out the body of the letter.  close the letter.  type your full name.  sign the letter.  keep a copy of the letter. 

 There are currently four major Sims games out there: The Sims, The Sims 2, The Sims 3 and the most recent and most expensive, The Sims 4. That's not including all the expansion packs that you can get.   If you want to become a pro at the Sims, buy the original game without the expansion packs at first. This makes everything much less complicated. Be wise in which game you choose. The Sims original is the first version and has a limited amount of things you can do compared to The Sims 2 and The Sims 3. The Sims 4 is extremely expensive and it is best if you buy this one later on, if at all.; , A tutorial is available in every Sims game. To become a pro, it would be helpful to go on a tutorial first so you know everything you have to do in the game before actually playing it properly.   In the Sims original, you can find the tutorial very easily. When you first go on the game there should be a house with a large arrow pointing on it. This is the house of Bob Newbie, and his life is mostly a literal tutorial. Play on this house and you will go on a step by step tutorial. In the Sims 2, the tutorial is available on the starting screen. If you open the 'options' menu then you should be able to find an option called 'tutorial'. Click on this and you will find some friendly descendants of Bob Newbie who's life is a living tutorial. In the Sims 3, immediately when you start playing there is a step by step tutorial on everything you need to know, and there is also a help option in the 'options' menu which gives you everything you need to know. This is also true for the Sims 4.  Even before you purchase the game, there is an abundance of guides, youtube videos and blogs on the subject, if you really want to be a pro before you start the game. There are also many wikiHow articles on the subject, such as this one.  Creating your Sim family is very time consuming so if you want to quickly get a family, move into an existing household by clicking on your desired house on the map and pressing 'play'. Don't build your own house at first, it is very time consuming and you need more experience with building.   If you want to create a new family, for your first time, create as little amount of Sims as possible, without only creating one Sim, because having only one Sim is very dull. At the start, its best to have two or three adult Sims. That way you get more money coming in from jobs and you don't have to worry about getting the children to school until later, when you are more experienced. In the Sims original, it is best to create Sims with personalities that are easy to manage. Bump up their Neatness, and Outgoing points are a plus as well. You very much want an Active Sim. You don't need to worry too much about the Playful and Nice points, but make sure that your remaining points go mostly towards the Nice section. Cancer is a good star sign to pick, as is Aries, Aquarius, and Scorpio, but you can choose to customise the personality points. In the Sims 2, the star signs are still there so you follow along the same lines as the Sims 1, concentrating on the Neat, Active and Outgoing sections the most and the Playful section the least. For your lifetime wish, the Family and Knowledge wishes are the easiest to achieve, and the Romance wish is the hardest to achieve (and your Sim will have a strong aversion to commitment). In the Sims 3, the star signs are scrapped to make room for traits. Try to choose good traits like Good, Friendly and Lucky. The skill traits like Handyman, Green Thumb and Neat are extremely helpful and Workaholic and Ambitious (especially Workaholic) is a must for a super successful career. Your lifetime wish depends on which traits you use, so be sure to look for specific combinations if you want specific lifetime wishes. The same goes for the Sims 4.  In the beginning, don't go into advanced editor until you are more experienced because this makes everything more complicated. In the Sims 1 there is a separate program for this that you definitely should not use until you are more knowledgeable. Instead, use pre-made hairstyles, outfits and faces.   You can even choose a whole pre-made Sim or a random Sim if you want.  Some people like to keep free will on, but this can be annoying when your Sims are travelling around the house doing exactly what you don't want them to do. In 'options' you can also turn on features to enhance your gaming experience and turn off options that make your computer slow. This makes the game easier to play.  You need the money to succeed in the Sims. In every game, jobs can be found by going on the computer or reading a newspaper. In the Sims 3 and 4 you can even go to a workplace to have any job you want.   You will need certain skills to succeed in jobs. Make sure your Sim has items bought from the build and buy section that can increase skills, such as an exercise machine, a chess board or a piano. In later versions of the game you will also need a good relationship with your boss and co-workers, but Sims in the Sims 1 and 2 don't need to worry about this because they don't have a boss or co-workers. Live frugally. At the start, you will not have much money, so don't buy furniture that you don't need. Delete second bathrooms and buy the second-cheapest sorts of furniture, wallpaper, doors and windows.  In every version of the game, there are cheats that you can use by pressing ctrl+shift+c and opening a cheat box. Entering specific words in the cheat box and pressing 'enter' can make you rich, change your personality, kill your Sims and a whole host of other things. Learn how to cheat in the Sims 1, 2, 3 or 4, depending on what game you have.  Eventually, as you become more and more experienced, you will become a real pro and learn how to do way more things on the game.  

install the sims.  go on a tutorial.  find tutorials and guides online.  create your sims or move in to an existing family.  don't worry too much about appearance.  customize your game in 'options'.  get a job.  use cheats.  enjoy your game. 

   Having a strong moral base will make it easier to remain true to who you are even when things get tough. Committing to your values may take courage from time to time, but it'll be well worth the effort. To fix your values firmly in place, take time to actually write them down. Keep the list somewhere secure and occasionally return to it, especially when your present circumstances start testing those values.; , Being unreasonably idealistic could prevent you from effectively dealing with the reality of your life, but being optimistic will allow you to acknowledge that reality while still hoping for the best outcome.   Challenge your negative thoughts. Instead of assuming that things will go poorly, acknowledge the possibility but fix your mind on what you need to do to prevent failure from happening.  Think ahead and plan for the future. Ask yourself what you want to accomplish and set the appropriate goals in response. Once you set those goals, commit to achieving them.   To some degree, you do need to live in the moment and enjoy your life for what it is. Don't let the blessings your life disappear because you're too focused on the future to pay attention to the present. On the other hand, failing to set goals for yourself can easily lead to stagnation, which can cause your life to feel less fulfilling than it could be.  When faced with an infuriating or anxiety-inducing situation, though, train yourself to remain calm and control those emotions instead of letting them run wild.   Instead of following through with a knee-jerk reaction, take the time you need to calm down and think through things rationally. React according to reason rather than emotion. This doesn't mean you can't have emotion, of course. On the contrary, accepting the fact that you do have feelings can be a difficult thing for some men, but the sooner you admit it, the easier it will be to control those emotions instead of letting them control you.  When things go wrong and your actions are to blame, accept your responsibility and move on. Similarly, when things go well and your actions are one primary cause, graciously accept your due credit for the accomplishment.   Don't blame others for your own lack of success, and don't focus on the negative behaviors others have done when evaluating why things went wrong. You have no control over the things other people do to you; you can only control your own actions, so it makes sense to focus on your actions when evaluating the past and moving forward.  Actively pursue knowledge and keep your brain in optimal working condition. Reading is a great way to do this, but you can also keep your mental abilities sharp by solving puzzles or tackling new challenges.  While it's important to keep your mind sharp, it'll be easy to overwork it if you don't give yourself a chance to escape from the world and relax every once in a while.   Hanging out with your friends can be an important part of relaxing, but you should also throw some alone time into the mix. When you do spend alone time, unplug from the world as much as possible. Get off the computer and turn off your phone. Spend time in solitude and give yourself a chance to recharge., You don't need to look like a bodybuilder—though, congratulations if you do—but some basic self-maintenance can go a long way. Keep the three cornerstones of a healthy lifestyle in mind: a healthy diet, regular exercise, and sufficient sleep.   You don't need to live on salad and protein smoothies to have a healthy diet. On the contrary, the healthiest diets are also the most balanced. You may, however, have to resist the temptation to binge on junk food. Man cannot live on bacon and deep-fried candy bars alone. Try to exercise as soon as you wake up in the morning. You can go to the gym if doing so appeals to you, but if it doesn't, you can still take a brisk walk or get your blood pumping with a few jumping jacks., Your appearance plays a major role in someone's first impression of you. While a woman's beauty rituals and routines can be somewhat complex, all you really need to do as a man is maintain some basic hygiene and wear clean, orderly clothes that fit the occasion.   Bathe regularly. You don't need to swim in your cologne, but you might consider dabbing some on for a special occasion, like an important date. If you have facial hair, keep it trimmed. If you only have stubble, keep it shaved. Wear clean clothes that look good, and make sure that they fit the occasion. Jeans and an old t-shirt are fine for a night with friends, but you should look a little sharper for a job interview or a first date.  Keep yourself updated on the world around you. Instead of filling your mind with relatively meaningless information, though, focus on the people and events that really matter. This might mean sacrificing some of the time you devote to sports or gaming to learn about things like the current state of foreign affairs or the economic effect of the latest natural disaster.   You need to understand the world you live in if you want to function in it as best as possible. This doesn't mean you can't devote time to your hobbies and interests, of course. These things are important since they help you wind down and recharge. Simply learn to prioritize your attention, and learn to enjoy your hobbies without letting them control your life.  There's a reason why bachelors have a notorious reputation for being slobs. Defy the stereotype and keep your personal space in relatively clean condition. You don't need to maintain absolute pristine conditions, but you should probably make sure that you can at least look down and see the floor instead of seeing piles of dirty laundry and empty take-out containers.  Debt can be a major burden, and having too much of it will make financial institutions less likely to loan you money for things like education, new cars, and better living spaces. In short, being financially irresponsible will prevent you from moving ahead in life.   Don't spend money you don't have, and save some of the money you do have. Setting a little of your paycheck aside in your bank account or investing some of it wisely can give you greater financial security during hard times.  The key to living an interesting life is to do interesting things. Challenge yourself to learn something new or travel someplace you've never seen before.   Find something that interests you and learn about it. This might mean doing something mental, like studying a new language, or doing something physical, like learning karate.  Regardless of whether or not this is fair, you should make a conscious effort to put a few seconds of thought into the things you plan on saying or doing before actually following through with them.   Being “hot-blooded” is often viewed as a masculine trait, but it generally isn't wise. While you shouldn't be afraid to take action, recognize that some impulses are not necessarily good. A quick evaluation should be enough to determine whether or not it's safe to proceed. For instance, if your first reaction is to insult your coworker or subordinate for a minor mistake, it'll be to everyone's benefit if you pause, question your impulse, and choose a better way to deal with the issue.  Seek the best course of action for all parties involved, even if you have to make some self-sacrifice along the way. By demonstrating your willingness to put others before yourself, you send the message that you're someone worth trusting.   Empathy isn't something that comes easily to many men, and it's easy to lose sight of other people when you're focused on your owl goals. Nevertheless, it's important to keep persisting in your efforts to meet the spoken and unspoken needs of other people. This does not mean sacrificing your self-respect, of course. There's a fine line between sacrificing for others and letting others walk all over you. The former is your choice, but the latter is a choice forced upon you that you blindly accept.  Treat other people with the same sort of genuine attitude you wish they'd demonstrate in return. Be true to yourself, and allow that truthfulness to spill out in the midst of your daily interactions.   Try not to say or do things you don't mean, even if you're trying to spare someone's feelings or defuse an ugly situation. Being caught in your insincerity will cause people to lose confidence in you, which will make it difficult to have a successful personal or professional relationship with that person. Take two major action steps here: stop telling white lies and keep any commitments you make (unless a true and unavoidable emergency prevents you from doing so).  You might be a son, a brother, a husband, or a father. You could have important connections to extended family, or your friends might be your family even though they aren't related. Regardless of where you fit, you need to make sure that you meet the responsibilities called for within that role.   Both men and women need to be equally involved in their families, but while this is already socially expected of women, society doesn't often place the same degree of expectation on men. For instance, a working mom may receive questions regarding how she balances her career with her family, but a working dad probably won't. By striving to meet your obligations within your family, you can build your relationships while also building your personal moral character. Families are life-long testing grounds, and treating your family well teaches you to treat others outside the family with similar care.  Contrary to popular belief, jerks don't get the girl—at least, not when the girl has any sense of self-respect. If you aren't already doing so, you need to stop treating women as objects and start looking at them as fellow human beings.  In any social situation, one person has to be the one who says “go.” Don't be afraid to be that person. Start making choices and arranging plans, and work through any objections as they come instead of worrying about them ahead of time.   The romantic realm offers the most obvious example. If you want to ask a girl out, ask her out. You might get rejected, but even if you do, her rejection at least frees your attention and allows you to start looking elsewhere. As a non-romantic example, consider the dynamic between you and your friends. Instead of being the one who gets invited to things, start reaching out and extending the invite yourself.  Nobody gets along with everybody, but you can probably tolerate most people if you can view them through an objective lens.   No one shares your exact history and current circumstances, so no one will think in exactly the same way you think. Moreover, each person is in a different stage of personal growth; you can probably look back on your life to a time you're not especially proud of. Once you learn to accept the strengths and weaknesses of other people, you can start influencing them from a place of genuine concern rather than harsh criticism.  Becoming a better man takes a lot of hard work, and you should be proud of your own accomplishments. You also need to acknowledge the help you receive from other people, though. Be grateful for that help internally, and be eager to share your gratitude externally to the appropriate parties.  

stay true to your values.make a conscious effort to define your core values—the principles you hold as true and unchanging—and commit to following through on those values regardless of any inconvenience that might result from doing so.  train yourself to be realistically positive.  pursue your goals.  stand steady under pressure.stress is unavoidable.  take responsibility for your own behavior.  sharpen your mind.  let your mind rest.  take care of your body.  maintain a well-groomed appearance.  stay informed.  clean your living and working spaces.  be responsible with your money.  experience something new.  think before you act.while foot-in-mouth syndrome can affect both men and women equally, men generally have more of a reputation to get in trouble for it.  adopt an altruistic attitude.  behave sincerely.  meet your familial obligations.there are many family roles you might play during your lifetime.  treat women with respect.  make the first move.  accept others for who they are.  demonstrate gratitude. 

 The signs of an ingrown eyelid are usually linked to eye irritation. Thus, dogs with ingrown eyelids tend to have a permanently watery eye on the affected side. This is the eye's way of trying to get rid of an irritant.   The moisture from the eye is never successful at getting rid of the irritation, so the watering continues indefinitely.; , A dog with an ingrown eyelid may squint and hold the eye partially closed. Having the eyelid closed may give the dog a bit of relief from the irritation associated with an ingrown eyelid.   However, dogs with this condition do not always squint, as they may have lived their whole life with an uncomfortable eye and are acclimated to the discomfort.  This is another sign that your dog's eyes are irritated. Your dog's eyes may become red due to an ingrown eyelid because the surface of the eye may be constantly rubbed by the eyelashes from the under-turned eyelid.   This constant rubbing can even lead to corneal ulcers, which is when the clear surface of the eye is worn away and eroded permanently.  Your dog may feel irritation on its eyes and rub or scratch them to relieve that discomfort. Some dogs will blink more regularly than you might expect, rub at the eye with a paw, or even push the face along the ground. These are all signs that there is an issue in your dog's eye.  Some dog breeds are prone to having excessive amounts of skin on their faces and they also tend to have too much skin in the eyelid. This extra skin is on the outer surface and has a tendency to cause the eyelid to 'scroll' inward toward the eye.   Think breeds with wrinkly faces, such as bulldogs, basset hounds, shar pei, pugs, Japanese chins, Pekinese, and bloodhounds., There are some breeds that seem to be over represented when it comes to entropion. This may be because the condition is genetic and these breeds tend to be bred only with like breeds, to keep the breed pure. These include (but are not limited to):Cocker and Clumber spaniels Dalmatians Rottweilers Akitas American Staffordshire bull terriers Poodles Great Danes Pyrenean Mountain dogs Bernese mountain dogs Golden Retrievers Labradors  , If you see any of the signs of an ingrown eyelid you should have your dog checked out by a vet. He or she will be able to assess and treat your dog's condition. Assessment is done by observation, both by looking at the dog with the naked eye, and by using the magnification of an ophthalmoscope to look closely at the leading edge of the eyelid.Some vets will double check their observations by putting a few drops of local anesthetic into the eye. This is because general eye pain can sometimes cause the dog to squint and, in some cases, cause the eyelids to appear as if they are ingrown. However, if the pain is removed and the eyelid still lies in an abnormal position, then it is confirmed that the entropion is due to extra skin, rather than muscular contraction due to pain.  This will help you to know exactly what is going on with your dog. For example, when the vet is looking with the naked eye, the vet may press gently with a thumb just below the eyelid in order to 'take up the slack' of any spare skin. It can then be possible to watch the eyelid unfurl into a more normal position. This will help you to understand the condition better.  Treatment for an ingrown eyelid is a surgical procedure where a sliver of skin is removed from just below the eyelid. This rectifies the excess skin and allows the eyelid to sit in its intended position. This procedure is called a blepharoplasty.Surgery for your pet can be expensive. If you don't have the financial resources to pay for surgery for your pet, discuss other options with your veterinarian. This may include giving your dog treatment for pain and discomfort. Some pet insurances can help with the cost of surgery. The insurance needs to have been purchased before your pet has a major health problem, but if you already have it in place it can offset the cost of surgery.  

pay attention to excessively watery eyes.  notice squinting.  look for red eyes.  keep an eye out for unusual scratching or rubbing of the eyes.  be especially vigilant looking for signs in wrinkly breeds.  look for signs in other specific breeds.  take your dog to the vet.  watch the vet examine your pet.  follow your veterinarian's treatment recommendations, if you can. 

 Before you begin the trimming process, make sure you have all your materials ready. Goats may dislike having their hooves trimmed. It may be difficult to grab brushes and clippers if your goat is agitated.   You will need a brush to dust off the goat's foot before trimming. You will also need something called a rasp, which you can purchase online or at a livestock store, which you can use to flatten out the hooves so they're level to the ground.You will need gloves to handle the goat's hooves. Goats feet can get messy.You will need two different types of clippers: hoof shears and a hoof knife. Both should be sharpened.While optional, it's a good idea to have blood stop powder. If you accidentally cut too deep, your goat's hoof may bleed slightly and require treatment. You can buy hoof stop powder at a local livestock or hardware store.; , It's much easier to trim a goat's hooves when they're soft. If possible, trim your goat's hooves after a rain or snow fall. Rain and snow naturally soften a goat's hooves. If you live in an area where rain or snow is unlikely, try dampening some grass with a hose. Allow your goats to play in this portion of the yard., To begin the trimming process, you will first need to restrain your goat. How you choose to restrain your goat depends on his temperament.   You can place your goat on a milking stand if he's generally docile and unlikely to kick or fall off. This makes it easier to reach your goat's hooves.If your goat is fidgety, or if you do not have a milking stand, you can also tie your goat to a post or fence. It may be helpful to have someone hold your goat as you lift his feet to trim and clean them., Once your goat is adequately restrained, you should clean his hooves. It can be hard to tell where to trim if your goat's hooves are covered in dirt and grime.   Use your brush to dust any dirt off the exterior of the hooves. Any manure, dirt, or grime should be removed regularly.Next, lift each hoof up and pick out any rocks, dirt, and mud trapped inside the hoof. It's vital to remove such debris as such materials can obscure your vision. This can make it difficult to see where you're trimming. 

gather your materials.  soften the hooves.  restrain the goat.  clean the hooves. 

 Use plywood, particle board, or MDF to create a base for the scratching post. Buy a piece that’s 2 ft by 4 ft by ½ in (.61 m by 1.2 m by 1.27 cm) or cut it to the correct measurements using a table saw.Exercise caution when cutting to ensure no one gets hurt.; , Your carpet should be at least 3 ft (.92 m) by 5 ft (1.5 m) to ensure you have enough to wrap around the base and staple it tightly. Use an X-acto knife and a ruler to ensure you have a neat, straight line.   Choose a stiff carpet, such as Berber, for a longer lasting post.  Flip the carpet upside down and lay the base in the middle of the carpet.   Draw a line straight out from each side of the base to the end of the carpet so you have squares extending from the corners.Draw a straight line ¾ in (1.9 cm) from the corner of the base that intersects the squares you made.Cut across the straight line first, then cut along the lines you made extending from the corners., Staple the carpet to the bottom of the base on one side, putting staples in every 2 in (5 cm). Pull the carpet tight and staple it on the bottom of the opposite side, putting staples in every 2 in (5 cm). Repeat on the remaining two sides, making sure to staple all the way to edge so your corners are flush., Purchase a 4 in by 4 in (10 cm by 10 cm) piece of wood from the hardware store. Alternatively, nail two 2 in by 4 in (5 cm by 10 cm) pieces of wood together, making sure they line up evenly.  Put the base upside down (carpeted side facing the post) on top of the post. Ensure it is centered and screw the post into the base using 2 in (5 cm) wood screws. Then, flip the base around so it is on the ground, with the post on top.   The length of the post is up to you, just make sure it is long enough for your cat to stretch on. If you’re not sure how long to make it, measure your cat from nose to end of tail, then add a few in/cm.  Get a 4 in by 4 in (10 cm by 10 cm) beveled wood square from the hardware store for a neat post topper. Use wood glue to attach the topper to the post.Alternatively, you can cover the top in carpet and staple it down. Put two staples on each side of the post, rather than on the top.  It needs to be at least 20 in (51 cm) wide in order to wrap around the post, and the exact height of the post. Use an X-acto knife and a ruler to ensure you have a neat, straight line.  Start at a corner and staple the carpet in place every 1 in (2.5 cm) vertically. Wrap the carpet completely around the post and staple it in place every 1 in (2.5 cm) along the vertical seam. Cut off any excess, and ensure you have a smooth seam so your cat’s claws don’t snag on the fabric.  Alternatively, you can wrap the post in sisal rope rather than carpet. Cover your post in non-toxic glue to ensure the rope won’t unravel.Wind the rope around the bottom of the post and staple it in place.Continue winding the rope all the way to the top of the post, making sure your rows are neat, straight, and very close together.Add staples if the glue doesn’t seem to be holding the rope well enough., Use a hammer to flatten the staples down. A staple gun does not always create a flush staple, and you want to ensure your cat’s claws don’t get hung up or ripped out due to a staple sticking out of the post.  

cut or buy the base wood.  cut the base carpet to size.  cut notches for the corners.  cover the base in carpet.  choose the post.  attach the post to the base.  cover the top of the post.  cut the post carpet to size.  wrap carpet around the post.  use rope as an alternative to carpet.  flatten the hardware. 

 This is most easily done through the internet on sites like eBay or Bolivia Mall.   It is also possible to build your own for a few dollars and a couple hours.Although homemade flutes will be the most rewarding to play, they may be difficult to make or to play in tune.; , The u-notch should rest on the upper segment of your lower lip.  Tilt the angle of the u-notch up and down until it makes a whistling noise. Your teeth will be slightly parted, and the opening between your lips will be wider than it is tall.   Did you ever make a sound by blowing across the top of a bottle? This is the same sort of thing, except you're blowing across the top of the quena. Help start each note by making a voiceless "t" sound. This is called tonguing. Don't use your voice, but make sure you are saying "too" instead of "who" into the quena.  Your left thumb should go on the bottom hole, your left pointer on the first, left middle on the second, left ring on the third, right pointer on the fourth, right middle on the fifth, and right ring on the sixth.   Your right thumb should support the instrument. Your pinkies can go where they feel most comfortable.  The first octave worth of major scale will be fairly easy to figure out, but if you want to learn the additional octaves and the chromatic scale, it will help to   Quena fingerings are sometimes imprecise, and may include half-covering a hole.  Unlike more advanced wind instruments, the quena does not have any moving parts to slide in or out to adjust the pitch, so if you are playing with other musicians, you will have to adjust using technique. You can also use these techniques if you want to bend the pitch.   Blow harder to raise the pitch (make it sharper), less hard to lower the pitch (make it flatter). The amount of breath you supply also will affect how loudly you play. Tighten your embouchure (the shape of your lips) to bring the pitch up; loosen it to bring the pitch down. Tilt the quena down (away from your mouth) to raise the pitch; tilt it up (toward your mouth) to lower it. Raise the pitch even further by opening the bottom-most hole that is covered in any given fingering. Lower the pitch, on notes with many open holes, by covering a hole further down, or by partially covering the next lower hole.  As with singing, the tone on the quena will benefit if you support your breath this way.  Get the spirit of Andean music inside you, and figure out how to play it on your quena.  

obtain a quality quena.  lift the quena to your lower lip.  blow straight out across the notch.  once you are able to do this almost instantly, start covering different holes, producing different notes.  consult a fingering chart.  tune your quena.  sit or stand up straight and breathe from the diaphragm.  purchase cds of renown andean groups and listen to them often. 

 Cushioned ear plugs are designed to comfortably reduce noise levels. Visit your local pharmacy to find some intended to wear while sleeping. Put them in at night, and you might not be able to hear the sounds of rats., If you are lucky, your rat problem will be manageable, and you will only hear the occasional squeak or scratch. If you play loud, vibrant music, you will have a better chance of covering up the rodents’ sounds so you can ignore them altogether.You can also try loud television, talk radio, or other types of audio.  You can purchase devices that emit what is known as white noise--a random, low-level sound that is a little like static. You can even find streaming audio channels that will play white noise continuously. White noise is thought to be soothing, and it may also help mask some of the sounds made by rats., There are a variety of meditation and breathing exercises that you can try before bed or any other time at night. These are known to help reduce stress levels and improve your sleep, so they can help you cope with the sounds of rats at night. For a simple exercise:Sit in a comfortable position, such as cross legged or on a chair. Focus by breathing in through your nose, holding it for a few seconds, then slowly exhaling through your mouth. Try to clear your mind of worries by focusing on a single visual object, repeating a short mantra (like “I am at peace”), or visualizing a place that makes you feel calm and happy. Do this as long as you like, but at least for a few minutes.  

wear ear plugs.  mask the noise with loud music or other audio.  try white noise.  meditate or try breathing exercises to calm yourself. 

 It is important to follow all the instructions your teacher has given. If there is something you aren't sure about, be sure to ask.    What is your presentation supposed to be about? How many minutes should your presentation last? Should the presentation include a visual aspect as well? For example, should you have a PowerPoint presentation, a flip chart, or other props? Are you allowed to have note cards in your hand while you present?; , During the real presentation, it's best to present either from memory or using a few note cards; however, it can be helpful while making your presentation to write out what you want to say word for word. This will help ensure that you don’t miss anything important, and you won’t be struggling to find the right words later on.If you are creating a visual presentation, writing out everything that you want to say will also help you pick out important points to include in the visual part of the presentation.  One of the most common ways that people create presentations today is using Microsoft PowerPoint. Create a slideshow and include a slide for each main point of your presentation. Remember not to overload your slides with too much information. Include one or two bullet points that make your main point. If you can, use an image that will enhance what you’re saying.   If you have been instructed to use a poster board or flip chart, then create your presentation using bold markers that will be able to be read easily from a distance. Consider gluing on images that help your presentation make sense. As with PowerPoint, make sure not to make your poster/flip chart too busy. You want your visuals to aid your presentation, not take over it.  Keep the presentation simple and neat. Unless your teacher has given specific instruction on this, stick to fonts and colors that are neutral and easy to read, like Garamond, Arial, or Times New Roman.Find ways to use pictures that can illustrate what you are talking about with your words. For example, if you are presenting on an important battle in history, you might find paintings, drawings, or photographs and use those to help your listeners imagine the battle.  Many times, people have prepared wonderful presentations only to find out that they aren’t able to open it on the day of the presentation because of some technical problem. It is a good idea to have your presentation (assuming it is an electronic presentation) saved and accessible in several different forms.   For example, you can save your presentation on one or even two different USB sticks, and you can also email the presentation to yourself. This way, you have a few different options for getting it open.  Although it may seem silly to you, if you want to impress your teacher, you will want to look nice on the day of the presentation. If you have a school uniform that your school requires you to wear, make sure it is clean and pressed. If you can wear what you want, try to dress business casual on that day.If you’re giving your presentation late in the day bring your presentation clothes with you and change into them right before class. If you’re giving the presentation early in the day, come dressed for the presentation and then have more casual clothes to change into, if you don’t want to wear your nice clothes all day. It is a good idea to lay out the clothes that you want to wear the night before. This way, you will know they are ready to go, and you won’t have to think about what you will wear at all on presentation day.  On the day of the presentation, take a little extra time to look nice. Bring your toothbrush or some floss so that you can get anything embarrassing out of your teeth before your presentation begins.If you wear makeup, consider bringing a bit of makeup for a touch up before your presentation. You could also bring a comb or brush to make sure your hair is neat.  Though it can sometimes be hard to sleep when you’re feeling nervous about something, do your best to get to bed on time. If you can’t relax, try having a warm cup of tea and do something that you find relaxing.   Try to make sure that your presentation is completely ready to go before going to bed. This will help keep you from laying in bed trying to remember anything you might have forgotten to take care of. Pack everything you will need for school including anything for the presentation before getting ready for bed.  Before practicing in front of others, it can be helpful to practice on your own. The key here is to practice as though it were the real thing. Doing so will help you identify any major problems with your presentation. Try to make this practice as realistic as possible. Stand up next to your presentation, as you plan to stand during the real thing.You might not have access to a projector, but you can still stand next to your computer for practice. If you are using a different visual presentation, set it up in the way that you plan to use it during the presentation. For example, hang your poster board on the wall. In your first trial runs, you may find that you have to stop to fix major problems or to make notes of things you want to say. This is OK to do, but try not to get in the habit of stopping every time you have a problem. Practicing helps to work out issues, but it also helps you practice getting past mistakes as smoothly as possible.  Even if your teacher has not assigned a maximum or minimum time limit, it is a good idea to time the presentation. This way, you will know how long your presentation is, and will also help you see whether or not you are consistently giving your presentation each time you practice.   You can use the timer on your phone or a stopwatch. If you don’t have either of those, try doing a Google search for “stopwatch” and you can use the built-in one on the Google search page. Alternatively, you can also just make a note of the time when you start the presentation and then see what time it is when you end the presentation. Don’t forget to factor in a few minutes for potential questions!  , While you are practicing your presentation, do your best to work on memorizing what you want to say, and when you want to say it. Your presentation will be a lot better if you aren’t constantly looking down at note cards or searching a piece of paper to figure out what you want to say next.Keep in mind that memorizing, in this case, doesn’t mean having a word for word script in your head. Instead, it means that you know what you are presenting well enough to do it without the use of note cards. It’s OK if you say things a lit bit differently each time you practice the presentation as this will make you seem confident and natural. If your teacher has said it’s OK, you could consider writing down a few points that you’re having trouble remembering on a small note card.  Ask your parents or another family member if you can practice your presentation on them. Tell them that you would like them to look for anything that is unclear in your presentation, any nervous habits you might have while giving your presentation (e.g. fidgeting with your hands), and anything else that you can improve for your actual presentation.Keep in mind that if your parents are the type that think everything you do is perfect then they may not be very critical of your presentation even though it would help you. On the other hand, if you have extremely critical parents, try to take everything they say in moderation, and remember that they just want you to do well.  It can be helpful to get feedback from different people. If you have a friend or classmate who is also giving a presentation ask them if she can help you practice, and offer to help her with her presentation in return.If you don’t have a classmate you want to ask, then ask a friend who you trust to be helpful with the presentation. Avoid asking a friend who you know will not take the task seriously.  Ask the people that are practicing with to try and come up with different questions about the content of your presentation. Your teacher or peers may want to ask questions about your topic at the end of your presentation so it’s a good idea to have a bit of practice with this.You may not be able to answer every question that is thrown at you, and this is OK. If you get a question that you don’t know the answer to, do your best to tell them what you do know, and tell them you will find out the rest of the answer and get back to them., There are a few things you can do before the presentation to help calm your nerves — many of which you can even do right at your desk. Try breathing deeply; silently repeating affirmations (such as "I can do this. I'm going to do a great job"); or using positive visualization (imagine yourself giving your presentation successfully and knocking it out of the park). These strategies can help you settle your nerves and go into your presentation feeling calm and collected.  By going first, you get your presentation out of the way. You won’t have to sit through the rest of the class worrying about your presentation. People are also less likely to remember the first presentations. If your presentation doesn’t go well your teacher is more likely to forget your mistakes if he has seen many other presentations.   If you really don’t want to go first, try to go second or third. The earlier you can get your presentation out of the way, the better.  Your teacher will probably allow you a few minutes to get set up for your presentation. During this time, open up your file on the computer (or set up your poster board of flip chart), make sure your note cards are in order (if you have them), and make sure that your clothes are in order (check that your pants aren’t unzipped).During this time, take a few deep breaths and reassure yourself that you’re going to do great. You’ve done everything you need to do to make your presentation go well.  If you are in a very big class, it is possible that not everyone knows your name; therefore, it is a good idea to say something like, “Hi everybody, if you don’t already know my name, I’m . Today, I will be presenting about…”   Don’t go into too much detail when introducing the topic of your presentation, but try to get your listeners interested quickly. For example, if you are presenting about how to choose a college, you could say something like, “You may think that where you go to college isn’t that important; however, you probably don’t realize that where you go to college will have a huge impact on your life. It will have an impact on where you live, who you meet, and most importantly whether or not you can get the job you want.”  , If you have practiced enough, this shouldn’t be difficult; however, some people talk too quickly and too quietly when they get nervous. Try to remind yourself to talk slowly and loudly enough so everyone can hear you.If you’re using an electronic presentation, you can use each new slide as a chance to stop for a few seconds and recognize whether you are speaking slowly and loudly enough for everyone to hear.  Even the best presenters make mistakes sometimes. If you do make a mistake or stumble over a word, don’t let that ruin the whole presentation. If you need to, take a few seconds to regroup, and start again where you left off.If the mistake was small, chances are that nobody even noticed it. If they did notice, they probably didn’t care too much. Remember that your teacher probably isn’t out to get you, and they won’t get mad at you for making a mistake. You can also make a joke out of the mistake. For instance, if you stumble over the pronunciation of a word, then purposely mispronounce the next word or two after that and really get the room laughing. Smile and laugh about it yourself — being able to laugh at yourself shows confidence. Then continue with the presentation.  Try to look around the room and make eye contact with various listeners for a few seconds. Don’t forget to also make eye contact with your teacher. During presentations, some people get nervous and seem to be staring at one point in the room or at the ground, which can be distracting for some people.If you are able to make eye contact for a few seconds with several different people over the course of your presentation, you will be giving the impression that you are relaxed and confident. Don’t forget to smile!  , It might be hard to remember everything you want to say while also worrying about what you are doing with your body, but do your best to be aware of what you’re doing with your hands, and how you’re standing.For example, it’s OK to use hand gestures, but don’t overdo it. Use hand gestures where they fit naturally into what you’re saying. Avoid crossing your arms or your feet; this gives the impression that you are not open to your audience. Don’t fidget with your hands. When you are not gesturing, you can clasp them together gently in front of you or simply let your arms hang at your sides. You don’t have to stand glued to one spot in the room, but don’t move around too much or too quickly. Remember that you are trying to convey a confident attitude.  Once you make it to the end of the presentation, pause for a few seconds to signal to everyone that you have finished. Then end the presentation by saying something like, “This concludes my presentation. I want to thank all of you for listening so attentively. Are there any questions?”   If your teacher has instructed that there will be no question and answer portion, then leave out the part where you ask if anyone has questions. Having a few closing remarks will bring the presentation to a more natural and less awkward close than if you simply stop talking and go to sit down at your desk.  

understand the instructions for the presentation.  write out what you want to say.  use visuals or a slideshow to create your presentation.  bring more than one copy of your presentation.  choose appropriate clothing.  make sure you are well-groomed.  get a good night’s rest.  practice the presentation alone.  use a timer.  memorize what you want to say.  ask your parents for feedback.  consider giving the presentation in front of a trusted friend.  have people ask you questions.  manage nervousness right before presentation.  offer to present first.  set up your materials.  introduce yourself and what you will be talking about.  speak slowly and enunciate clearly.  don’t panic if you make a mistake.  make eye contact.  be aware of your body language.  thank everyone for their time and attention. 

 Why exactly do you want the first chair spot? Attention? Self-accomplishment? This will help your devotion and motivation.; , The history. Study the parts of it, study how everything works. Study, study, study.  Clean it properly. Empty out the saliva. Apply anti-rust sheets. Do whatever you need to  , Even if nothing seems wrong, bring it anyway. There will be a 75% chance of something being off.  How is their embouchure? Posture? By observing those around you, you'll see exactly how much improvement you need.  Like the saying goes, "Practice makes perfect." For the flute, start practicing long tones, vibrato, and dynamics. Those are three key things flute players have trouble with, and if you perfect these, your band director will definitely notice.  Okay, there might be some mixed thoughts about this, but show off a little. This will get you noticed by your band director and bandmates- just don't overdo it. Really emphasize those accents. If you've practiced well enough, be the only one in class to get that new music right the following day of getting it. Be the only one playing when sight-reading.  Not during rehearsal, but before it starts and maybe during water breaks. Talk to your peers-tell them about how you thought the last measure was epic. Ask your band director questions if need be. Throw some compliments around. You need to get noticed if you ever want to be considered (or even rooted for) for first chair.  Always give it your best shot. Not only will this be better on you, but everyone will notice and admire you for it. Relax, and ask to try for the first chair spot. Or perform a piece your director gave to you and the rest of the section.  

think about why you want this.  research your instrument.  take care of your instrument.  bring it to the shop to get repaired.  observe your peers-especially the one already in first chair.  practice.  show off.  socialize.  try your best. 

 You'll need a craft bench level 2 to be able to make a boat. If you don't already have one, upgrade a level 1 craft bench.   Upgrade by tapping on the craft bench and looking for the upgrade icon. An upgrade requires 1 limestone block.      ; , A graphical user interface will open. Look for the boat icon. It will be obvious in the first few slots, after the basket, camera, string and donkey's carrot on a stick.  It will tell you that you need 2 wood blocks and 2 pieces of linen.  The boat will transfer to your inventory when the status bar reaches the end.  

upgrade your craft bench.  tap on the craft bench level 2.  tap on the boat icon.  tap on "craft". 

 While at home it may be easy to provide the perfectly balanced dietary requirements, but on the road it’s not as simple. They’ll see easily recognizable fast-food locations along the road, or there just won’t be the foods you would like to provide. Let them enjoy the trip. You can return to routine when the trip is finished., Kids will be distracted during travel. The mundane observations of daily life, like a plane departing, often provide wonder to little eyes and minds. Getting them to eat normal meals will be difficult, and cries of hunger quickly become irritating. Pack a variety of items (e.g. carrot sticks, pretzels, granola bars, raisins) in plastic bags to ensure you have options.Be careful with sticky or messy items that can cause a mess. While traveling, it’s more difficult to keep a keen eye on little ones while eating. If traveling by air, avoid snacks with liquids that may cause security issues. Don’t pack items that have strong smells. Be considerate of fellow travelers.  There are countless recommendations for travel with children because it’s an often trying, difficult, infuriating experience. Bring bribery material like a few pieces of candy.Bring gum if taking a flight. If your kids are old enough to handle it without making a mess, it’s a treat that may help clear painful Eustachian tube blockages. 

relax nutrition standards.  bring plenty of snacks.  bribe children with food when necessary. 

 Make sure that the container has a tight-fitting lid, and that it will fit in your freezer.   This recipe is based on the use of 6-ounce Limeade cans. if you’re using 12-ounce cans, the ratios still work; you may just want to cut them in half if you don’t want to wind up with 132 ounces of margarita.  You’ll use the empty Limeade cans to measure out your other ingredients (hence the use of “cans” as a measurement). What to add to the container:   2 cans frozen Limeade concentrate 6 cans water 2 cans tequila 1 can triple sec  , This can take 4 or more hours. You can keep the mixture in the freezer overnight; the alcohol content will keep it slushy — it won’t freeze solid., Before serving your drinks you’ll want to prepare your glasses by wetting their rims with fresh lime juice and dipping them in coarse salt.  Remove the container from the freezer. If it has a tight lid on it, you can shake it vigorously to break up the ice and ensure that all the ingredients are properly mixed.   If you’re unable to tightly seal the container and shake it, open it up, place it on the counter, and stir it with a whisk.  The recipe makes 66 ounces: you should be able to make roughly 8 to 12 margaritas from it, depending on the size of your drinks.  

get a tupperware container that can hold 66 ounces of fluid.  mix your ingredients together in the tupperware container.  wait for it to reach a slushy consistency.  prepare your glasses.  remove the mixture from the freezer.  serve with a ladle. 

 You may have to break the tile into small pieces and remove it. The biggest problem with this is that you can easily break some of the adjoining tiles.   Using a grout saw or other tool, remove the grout from the tile joints surrounding the damaged tile(s). Be careful not to cut through any membrane waterproofing underneath or behind the tiles.       Using a masonry bit, drill a hole through the middle of the tiles you need to remove. For large tiles you may need to drill several holes so the tile can be broken up to remove it. Again, be careful not to drill too deep, or the substrate and/or any waterproofing membrane may be damaged.       Use a chisel to break out the tile(s) in small pieces.       Remove the thinset mortar or tile adhesive behind the tile you have removed. You will need a smooth, clean surface to install the replacement tile(s) on.      ; , You may have to repair rubber or vinyl membranes to assure there isn't a leak underneath the tiles you are replacing, and the methods for doing so vary depending on the membrane used.  For small repairs, you may have to use a putty knife to apply this material.  Make sure the joints around the tile are uniform, and the surface of the newly installed tile(s) are flush with the surrounding tiles.  Use a sponge and plenty of water to clean excess grout off the tile's surface. Once this material has dried and cured, it is difficult to remove. 

remove damaged tiles together with tile adhesive (cement under tiles).  make sure any waterproof membrane is undamaged before proceeding.  get some ceramic tile adhesive, or thinset tile cement and apply it to the substrate with a notched trowel.  replace the tile by pushing it into the adhesive or thinset firmly so it is bedded in the material.  wait for the tile adhesive to dry and then grout the joints surrounding any new tiles you have installed.  use a good, waterproof bathroom sealant or caulk to repair any joints that do not lend themselves to grouting, such as metal trim or fixture penetrations.  

 Water should only be an inch or two deep. It shouldn't be too cold, as budgies are susceptible to cold.   You can also find baths that attach to the side of your bird's cage. If you find your bird doesn't like the bowl of water, you can also try wet grass or greens at the bottom of a (clean) cage. Your bird will enjoy rolling in them as a way of bathing.You don't need to use soap.; , If you're worried about water splashing out, set a towel under the cage. It will help catch the splashing.  Set the bath in the bottom of the cage where your budgie can jump in. Make sure it's on a level surface.   If you prefer, you can also fill up your sink with a small amount of water. Take the budgie in there, and close the door so she can't fly away. However, make sure your sink is clean first.  Budgies will splash and flutter in the water. The splashing is the budgie giving themself a bath. Most budgies enjoy the process immensely.If you're budgie doesn't jump in immediately, give her a chance to get used to it. If he or she still doesn't hop in, you may want to move on to the next method., Your bird will shake herself to get the water off. However, make sure that the area they are drying off in isn't breezy or cool. You might want to cover his or her cage with a towel to help., After you bath your bird, take the bowl or bath out of the cage. Make sure to wash it out thoroughly and wash your hands when you're done.  

fill a shallow bowl with lukewarm water.  put a towel under the cage.  place the bowl in the bottom of the cage.  let the budgie play.  let your bird dry off.  clean out the bath.

 Pop the popcorn kernels using a pot on a stovetop, or in a microwave. For more tips on popping popcorn, read wikiHow's instructions for making popcorn.   If you're using a microwave, consider reading about how to microwave popcorn.; , Line a baking tray with parchment paper or a silicone baking sheet.   If the baking dish is non-stick, you could rely on that, but note that the Kool-Aid will probably make the surface sticky and harder to stir/remove the popcorn pieces, as well as clean the dish.  Using a wooden spoon, spread the popcorn on the baking dish. Try to avoid heaping the popcorn, instead aiming for a neat and flat single layer. If you find the dish isn't large enough, use two dishes. , In a small pot, place the sugar, syrup and butter into a saucepan. Heat to boiling and boil for three minutes until the liquid bubbles. Remove the pot from the stovetop and set aside for about 10 minutes. This forms the sugar syrup.   Keep an eye on this while the syrup boils and stir if needed. Do not let it boil for too long, as it can easily burn.  Add the two packages of Kool-Aid in a medium mixing bowl. Pour the baking soda and mix thoroughly using a spoon.  Slowly pour the sugar syrup into the Kool-Aid mixture. Stir with a wooden spoon to combine completely.  Using a fork, drizzle the Kool-Aid colored sugar syrup evenly over the spread-out popcorn. Mix the popcorn around with the wooden spoon to coat the popcorn pieces completely with the syrup, turning each piece a new color.  Place the baking dish filled with colored popcorn into the preheated oven. Bake for 10 minutes, then remove and stir.   Hold the dish with oven mitts each time, and have a heatproof surface to set the dish down onto.  Repeat this remove-and-stir process two more times for another 10 minutes of baking, stirring, then baking. In all, this will take about 40 minutes of baking time.  Remove the colored popcorn from the oven. Allow to cool. Sit the baking dish over a wire cooling rack to provide sufficient aeration for cooling.  Break up for serving. When it is cool enough to handle, pull apart any pieces stuck together. It is now ready for serving. Tip into a suitable large bowl and serve. Enjoy!  

make the popcorn.  prepare the baking dish.  spread the popcorn across the prepared baking dish.  preheat the oven to 225º fahrenheit or 110º celsius.  ,  heat the sugar, syrup, and butter.  prepare the kool-aid.  pour the sugar syrup into the bowl.  add the syrup over the popcorn.  bake the popcorn.  return for another 10 minutes, then remove and stir.  have the popcorn cool.  serve and enjoy! 

 If you find a nest of baby wild rabbits and the mother is not around, or if you see tiny baby wild rabbits hopping around on their own, you may think they are orphans. More times than not, however, this is not the case—their mother is simply not at the nest and will return later. It would be better for you to be certain whether the babies are orphans before attempting to feed and care for them.   Wild rabbit mothers nurse for short periods during the night and early dawn, then leave the nest during the day.Therefore, it would not be surprising if you did not see the mother with her babies during daytime hours. If the babies’ tummies look nice and plump, you can be confident that their mother is caring for them. If you look closely at their bodies, you may be able to see a ‘milk line’ through their skin—evidence of nursing.If you want to be sure the mother is around, you can place string in a grid pattern over the nest.Arrange the string in the evening and check it in the morning. If it is disturbed, then the mother has returned to the nest. Baby wild rabbits who appear cold, weak, dehydrated (loose skin stays tented when you pinch it), or injured are likely orphaned.Since baby wild rabbits are extremely difficult to rehabilitate and care for,you should contact a wildlife rehabilitation center as soon as possible. , In the event that you are not able to get to a wildlife rehabilitation center right away, you may need to provide at least initial care (food, general comfort) to the orphaned baby wild rabbits. Regular goat milk is frequently recommended for baby wild rabbits.Kitten and puppy milk replacers are also good choices.Milk replacers are available at your local pet stores. You may be able to find regular goat milk at your local grocery store. If it is not available there, ask the grocer where you can find it. Cow’s milk and human baby formula (Pedialyte) are not recommended for feeding baby wild rabbits.If the baby wild rabbits are cold prior to you feeding them, warm them up by placing them in a shoebox lined with a clean, soft cloth. Set a heating pad on low and set in a tabletop. Place the shoebox halfway on the heating pad—this will allow the babies to move away from the heat if they become too warm., Knowing what to feed baby wild rabbits is only half the battle—knowing how to feed them is a crucial component to their survival. Because they are so small, baby wild rabbits can be fed with a syringe (one to three milliliters), which is available at your local pharmacy.Eyedroppers are another good option.To remove harmful bacteria from the milk or formula, warm them up in the microwave or boil them on the stove.Cold milk or formula could cause potentially fatal diarrhea in baby wild rabbits.Keep the feeding area quiet so as not to stress the babies.One at a time, gently pick up each baby wild rabbit and hold him loosely but firmly in a soft cloth. Tilt his head so that it is higher than his back end and place the syringe near the side or bottom of his mouth—these two actions will prevent him from accidentally inhaling the liquid down into his lungs.Do not overfeed the baby wild rabbit. You will know when to stop feeding when his tummy becomes slightly rounded.Visit the website http://www.orphanedwildlifecare.com/rabbitandhare.htm to know how much to feed, and how often, according the baby wild rabbits’ ages. Make sure to wash your hands before each feeding session., After the baby wild rabbits have finished eating, it is important for them to urinate and defecate to keep their digestive and urinary systems healthy. To do this, stroke the anal area with a cotton ball moistened with warm water until the rabbit urinates and defecates.

 Gently warm up one cup of honey over low heat. Add 3-4 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice to the warm honey. Add ¼ to ⅓ cup water to the honey-lemon mixture and stir while continuing to heat on low. Refrigerate the mixture. When you need the cough medicine, take 1-2 tablespoons as needed.   Medicinal honey, such as Manuka honey from New Zealand, is recommended but any organic honey will have antibacterial and antiviral properties.Lemon juice contains high levels of Vitamin C-- the juice of 1 lemon contains 51% of the daily Vitamin C requirement. Lemon juice also has antibacterial and antiviral properties.It is believed that the combination of Vitamin C and the antimicrobial properties make lemon useful for coughs.Do not give honey to any child under 12 months of age. There is a small risk of getting infant botulism from bacterial toxins sometimes found in honey. There are less than 100 cases of infant botulism in the US every year and most babies recover fully, but better to be safe!; , Cut a washed, whole lemon into thin slices (along with the skin and the seeds). Add the slices to one cup of honey. Heat over low heat for 10 minutes with constant stirring.   Break up the lemon slices as you stir. Once finished cooking, strain the mixture to get the leftover lemon slices out and then refrigerate.  Garlic has antibacterial, antiviral, antiparasitic and antifungal properties.Peel 2-3 cloves of garlic and chop them as finely as possible. Add it to the honey-lemon mixture before you add water. Heat on low flame for about 10 minutes. Then add ¼ to ⅓ cup water to the honey-lemon mixture and stir in while heating over the low flame.   Refrigerate the mixture. When you need the cough medicine, take 1-2 tablespoons as needed.  Ginger is often used to improve digestion and to treat nausea and vomiting, but it has also been traditionally used as an expectorant. It can help a cough by thinning out mucus and phlegm and as a bronchial relaxant.Cut and peel about 1.5 inches of fresh ginger root. Finely grate it and add to honey-lemon mixture before adding water. Heat on low flame for about 10 minutes. Then add ¼ to ⅓ cup water, stir the mixture, and then refrigerate. Refrigerate the mixture. When you need the cough medicine, take 1-2 tablespoons.  Licorice is also an expectorant. It is mildly stimulating, so it helps to produce phlegm and thereby remove it from the lungs.Add 3-5 drops of Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) essential oil or 1 teaspoon of dried licorice root to the honey-lemon mixture before you add water. Heat on low flame for about 10 minutes then add ¼ to ⅓ cup water to the mixture while continuing to heat over the low flame. Refrigerate the mixture. Take 1-2 tablespoons as needed.  If you don’t have, don’t like, or can’t use honey, substitute glycerin. Heat ½ cup of glycerin with ½ cup of water over low heat. Then add 3-4 tablespoons of lemon juice to the mixture. Add ¼ to ⅓ cup water to the glycerin-lemon mixture and stir while continuing to heat over the low flame. Refrigerate the mixture. When you need the cough medicine, take 1-2 tablespoons as needed.   Glycerin has “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) status with the FDA. Pure glycerin is a colorless and somewhat sweet vegetable product that is used to make all sorts of ingestible products and personal care products.Because glycerine it is hygroscopic-- it takes up water-- it can be helpful in small amounts to reduce any swelling in the throat. You should get natural glycerin (and not the synthetic or man-made form). Be aware that glycerin is used to treat constipation, so if diarrhea becomes a problem, reduce the amount of glycerin used (¼ cup glycerin with ¾ cup water in the basic recipe). Prolonged and excessive ingestion of glycerin can increase blood sugar and blood fat levels. 

make honey and lemon cough medicine.  use an alternate method of making honey and lemon cough medicine.  consider adding garlic to the honey and lemon cough medicine.  consider adding ginger to the honey and lemon cough medicine.  consider adding licorice to the honey and lemon cough medicine.  use glycerin as a substitute for honey. 

 Every life insurance policy has increasing amounts of insurance available at concurrent increasing monthly rates. For example, a $20,000 policy may only cost $3 a month, but a $100,000 policy may cost $10 a month. You have to decide how much coverage you think you will need and how much you want to pay per month.Take stock of all your debts, assets, and desired final expenses in order to figure out an accurate amount you will need available to your family after you pass on. You may also consider incorporating the cost of other life expenses, like making sure your child's education is paid for by your coverage.; , Although there are other types of life insurance, the most common policies purchased by individuals are term and whole. Their names suggest their definitions: “term” is life insurance that ends at the end of a “term” of years, i.e. when you turn a particular age; “whole” is life insurance that lasts your whole life and never expires unless you stop paying.Term insurance is cheaper because it only considers mortality rate plus administrative costs. Whole life is more expensive due to the combination of mortality rate and a savings element (usually at a guaranteed low rate).  The best rates may already be available to you through your employer. Most large companies that offer health insurance to their employees also offer life insurance, and these rates, as is usual when employers pay partial amounts on insurance policies, can be pretty low.   If you don’t know how to access your life insurance information, ask someone in HR. Most insurance information is bundled together on a benefits website for your company. You can usually only sign up or make changes once a year during open enrollment, or if you have a qualifying life event like getting married or having a baby.  The first thing you would do when shopping for any big ticket item starts with research to find the best prices and most reputable brands. The same is true for life insurance. You can find “instant quotes” on many life insurance websites, or you can call individual companies to give you quotes., Just like you do before investing in a new appliance or expensive item, you should read reviews written by fellow consumers to make sure the company you decide to go with doesn’t have a lot of complaints. Consumer reviews are usually unbiased and honest, making them a solid way to find out what a company is really like.   You can find life insurance reviews by visiting a consumer review website.You should also consider financial strength of the insurance company issuing policy. Look at Fitch, Moody's, and Standard & Poor's ratings for each company. These ratings can be accessed for a fee from the relevant rating company's website.  The younger you are, the lower your rates will be. However, you can't lock in a rate unless you buy an extended term. Such policies include the mortality element for each year of the term, as well as a saving factor that provides a level premium. Increasing age brings increasing premiums., You can get a lower premium to start with if you already have a healthy lifestyle. But if you started with at an unhealthy level and recently improved your health, you can re-apply and perhaps see a drop in your life insurance premiums, especially if you have proof of this from a doctor.Losing weight, quitting smoking and working on your cholesterol can make measurable differences in your health that equate to life insurance discounts.  If you fly airplanes for fun or drive a race car for a living, life insurance companies see you as high risk and don’t want to take you on. You may still be able to get life insurance, but the premiums will be much higher than for those with desk jobs, for example.Jobs that are seen as high risk include pilots, fire fighters, police officers, deep sea fishermen, and military personnel. Hobbies that are seen as high risk include scuba diving, motorcycle riding, hang gliding, and sky diving.  It may seem odd, but your driving record is important to life insurance companies. If you have a lot of points on your license or have more than one DUI, this indicates that you are not a safe driver and are therefore at greater risk of dying soon.   Typically a few minor infractions don’t make a big difference to insurers, but as soon as you start repeating offenses, things start to go downhill in terms of the life insurance rates you will be offered., Most life insurance companies factor credit history in their premiums. While having poor credit will not prevent you from qualifying for life insurance, it will likely make your premiums higher than those given to an identical applicant with good credit. Underwriters factor in credit scores when determining life insurance risk because, in theory, a high credit score shows responsibility on the part of the applicant., Some insurance companies may require an abbreviated or full medical exam before issuing a policy. Their decision is based upon the amount of insurance applied for, your age, domicile, and the content of your application.   Your insurance agent will probably supply you with paperwork for both you and your doctor to fill out.  You can save money if you pay your entire year’s worth of payments in one fell swoop. Like monthly car insurance payments, there may be a slight charge for the convenience of smaller monthly payments. If your insurance company doesn’t offer to let you pay all at once, ask your agent about it., Life insurance tends to increase with each year that you get older. It makes sense—the older you are, the closer you are to death and the closer they are to forking out the cash they promised. To avoid paying more than you should, find out how your chosen insurer determines your age and use that information to apply at an advantageous time.Companies use two methods to determine your age for life insurance purposes: actual age or age nearest birthday. The latter means that in the preceding six months before your birthday and the following six months after your birthday, you will be consider the age you reach on your birthday. Check which method is employed by the company issuing the policy before deciding when to apply.  Some insurance companies who offer more than one type of insurance may offer to let you “bundle” your life insurance in with your car, home, even health insurance. Bundling allows a shared administrative cost for all of your policies, so you may end up saving money. However, bundling can also be a way for the insurer to trick the buyer into thinking they are getting a good deal. Check rates before and after bundling to ensure savings., If you have a change in circumstance, you can ask to be re-evaluated to see if your rates will drop. Obviously this change will never be that you got younger, but it may be that you got healthier or that you changed to a safer job. 

decide how much coverage you want.  compare term and whole life insurance.  check into the policies your employer offers.  look online to compare rates.  read reviews on different companies.  purchase insurance when you are young.  stay healthy.  avoid dangerous hobbies and occupations.  maintain a clean driving record.  maintain a good credit score.  prepare for a medical exam.  pay annually.  apply before your birthday.  consider bundling insurance policies.  ask for reconsideration if your situation changes. 

 Of course, if you are doing this outdoors or in a cold pool, it'll be ready in advance. This method is short and sweet, and is especially great for both swimmers and athletes who will be using ice baths to help them recover from activity.Once your water is ready, get your mind ready for the shock.  Since most of your sensory receptors are in these areas they are the most important to overcoming the shock.This is an easy way to get started if you don't yet have the mental strength to jump right in quite yet.   If you can't dip these areas in the water, splash cold water over these areas instead.  Just go for it. Jump right in and make sure that your entire body is covered head to toe in cold water. Leaving any areas dry and warm will detract from adjustment, as your body will have something to compare the cold water to.  If you are swimming this will be easy, but it can be harder in a shower or bath. Shift your weight and move your feet. Any muscle movement will help kick-start the body's process of thermoregulation and adjustment.  At first it will be tempting to jump out of the water or turn the temperature up. Don't let yourself. You can build a mental wall against the cold until your body fully adjusts and embraces it. Each time you build this wall and endure the cold it gets easier, both psychologically and physically, due to increasingly efficient thermoregulation.  

get the water ready.  get your face, ears, hands, and feet wet.  take the plunge.  keep moving.  mentally brace yourself. 

 A beach picnic could be lunchtime or evening. In very hot weather, evening is the best choice as the chances of sunburn will be removed and the warmth of the sand will be pleasant.; , Beaches are not the best place to be setting up a barbecue, so the best option is to make sure that you select food that tastes wonderful when it is cold and to make sure that the flavours across the meal complement each other well. Some great choices for a beach picnic include:   Spreads and dips with crusty bread Marinated vegetables Quiche Pasta and rice salads Fruit salad or whole fruit Slices of cake, cookies or brownies  , This will reduce the need for too many knives, forks and plates. However, you will probably still need serving spoons or forks for some items of food. And don't forget the serviettes - they'll be useful for removing sand as much as food crumbs!  , Take along a cooler to keep drinks chilled for the whole time you are there.  It is much more pleasant to sit on a picnic blanket than directly on the sand. This will also help keep some sand out of the food, although this is almost inevitable anyway!  , If you have decided to have a daytime beach picnic, always include shade producing items. There is a range of shade furniture that can be taken to the beach, including large umbrellas and shade tents. In some places, a shade tent might also serve as excellent protection against insects.  For a daytime picnic, these are essential inclusions.  

decide the of day when you'll have your picnic.  choose food that tastes great cold.  aim for finger food.  keep the drinks chilled.  bring a picnic blanket.  take shade items.  don't forget hats and sunscreen.

 You'll need to prepare your casing for the haggis the day before you want to make it. You can use sheep or beef stomach which is also called the bung. Place the stomach in cold salted water and let it sit overnight.Soaking the stomach will soften it so that it's easier to fill and boil the next day.; , Bring a large pot of water to boil and add a handful of salt. Rinse the sheep organs (liver and heart) and the tongue. Add the liver, heart, and tongue to the pot and cook them over medium heat for 2 hours. Carefully remove them from the pot using kitchen tongs and place them on a cutting board.   A long cooking time is needed to soften and tenderize these tough-muscled meats.  Let the liver, heart, and tongue cool a little so you can easily handle them. Take a sharp chef's knife and mince the liver, heart and tongue on your cutting board. Mince them into very small pieces, as small as you can manage. Trim off any gristle or skin from the meat and throw the trimmings away.If you're having trouble mincing the meat, try grinding it in a food processor or with a cheese grater.Always use caution when cutting with sharp knives. Ensure your cutting board is on a firm and stable surface when you're mincing the meat.  Transfer the minced meats to a large mixing bowl. Stir in 1/2 pound of suet, 3 medium onions that have been minced, 1 cup (225 g) of toasted pinhead or steel-cut oats, 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of kosher salt, 1 teaspoon ground black pepper, 1 teaspoon of dried coriander, 1 teaspoon of mace, and 1 teaspoon of nutmeg. Stir in a few tablespoons of the water from your pot into the mixture just to moisten it.Avoid adding so much water that the haggis mixture binds together into a ball. You want to keep it loose enough to fill the casings.  Take the stomach that soaked overnight out of its salted water. Rinse the inside and outside of the stomach with fresh unsalted water. Pat the stomach dry and lay it on a clean surface.Depending on the sizes of your haggis, you can make several small haggises or just one or two larger ones.  Take a large spoon and scoop the haggis mixture into the stomach casing. If you want to make one large haggis, fill the stomach 2/3 full with the haggis. If you choose to make smaller haggises, just fill the stomach as little as you like. Tie off the loose end of the stomach using kitchen twine. Pierce the stomach casing in several places so that steam can release as it cooks. If you really want a tight seal on the stomach casing, you can sew the stomach closed. You can use a sausage stuffer tool to quickly fill several haggises.  Heat a large pot of water to barely simmering (around 180 degrees F or 82 C). Carefully lower the haggises into the water. If you're doing one large haggis, let the haggis cook in the simmering water for three hours. Several thinner haggises will take less time to cook, around 1 1/2 hours.Watch the haggis as it cooks. If you see any air bubbles form, take a sharp skewer and poke the air so that the haggis doesn't burst. Avoid splashing the hot water as you lower the haggises. You might want to wear oven mitts to protect your hands.  The haggis will probably float near the surface of the pot once it's done cooking. Carefully remove the haggis and place it in a bowl of ice cold water to stop the cooking process. Let the haggis cool completely before you slice it and serve it.You can cut into the haggis while it's still hot, but the haggis will spill out of the casing and you won't be able to cut it. Consider serving the haggis with neeps and tatties.  

soak the stomach overnight.  cook the liver, heart and tongue.  mince the liver, heart, and tongue.  combine the meat with the seasonings.  rinse the sheep or beef stomach casting.  fill the stomach casing.  cook the haggis.  remove the haggis. 

 Using a moisturizer will help your lips to stay hydrated and to absorb moisture more easily. Moisturizers are an essential part of keeping your lips as hydrated as they can be. Look for the following ingredients in your moisturizers:Shea Butter Emu Butter Vitamin E Oil Coconut Oil; , Apply a lip balm to promote healing and prevent chapped lips. Lip balm also helps to seal in moisture and protect your lips from outside irritations.Apply lip balm every hour or two to treat dry lips and to keep them healthy. Use balm with SPF of at least 16 to save your lips from sun damage. Apply lip balm after you have applied a moisturizer. Find a balm that has beeswax, petroleum, or dimethicone.  Petroleum jelly (e.g., Vaseline) can help seal and protect your lips, acting as a balm. Using petroleum may also help to protect against the sun, which may dry and crack lips.Apply a sunscreen formulated for lips under the petroleum jelly.  

apply a moisturizer.  use lip balm.  try using petroleum jelly. 

 If being called ugly strikes a nerve, you might feel upset or hurt. Don’t release your strong emotions on the person because aggression can make the bullying worse or escalate the situation.Try to control your emotions before responding. If you notice yourself getting angry or upset, take some deep breaths. Slowly lengthen each breath so that you’re breathing longer and fuller breaths.  Take your breaths from your belly, not your chest. Try counting each breath. For example, inhale for four seconds, then exhale for four seconds.; , Not letting someone’s words affect you shows your power over a situation. When someone’s words affect you and hurt you, that person has power over you. Don’t give the person this power. Ignore their comments and don’t emotionally react.Ignoring these comments is easier said than done and it might take some practice. Repeat to yourself, “This person’s words and opinions don’t have to change how I feel about myself.”  , Stand up for yourself and don’t back down. If you decide to speak out, talk confidently.Speak up for yourself by saying that the comments are mean and don’t reflect who you are.  For example, say, “I don't know why you would call me ugly. Your opinion of how I look doesn’t change who I am.”  , Maybe someone called you ugly for having a big nose, curly hair, or big feet. These features don’t carry negativity in themselves. Maybe you do have these features and some people don’t find them attractive. That’s okay. Remind yourself that this person is judging you and you don’t have to take it negatively.   For example, say, “Yes, I do have a big nose. How astute of you to notice.”  , Humor can undermine the harsh words and diffuse any tension of the situation. However, don’t use humor to fire an insult back. Humor is a great way to respond make a statement that their words won’t hurt you.Exaggerate the comment by adding to it. For example, say, “I guess I am pretty ugly. I’ll probably have a swan-like transformation any day now!”  , Ultimately, the way you feel about yourself is more important than the way other people perceive you. Lots of people have lots of opinions, but the ones that matter most are the ones you have of yourself. Learn to prioritize the way you see yourself above the way others see you.If someone calls you ugly, remind yourself that your opinion matters more than theirs, and they cannot make you feel ugly.  Many people see themselves with a critical eye. If you find it easy to list off the things that are “wrong” about you or that you do not like, try building a list of the things you do like about yourself. Take a look in the mirror and instead of focusing on what you don’t like, find what you enjoy about your body. Maybe you like your eye color, skin tone, lips, hands, or anything!   Make a list of the things that you enjoy about your body and remind yourself of these things when you feel low.  Nobody can define what pretty, normal, or beautiful are on the whole. As the saying goes, “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder” and this applies to attraction as well. If you feel low about your looks or what people have said to you or about, start building your own self-acceptance. Have compassion on yourself. See yourself as an imperfect person and have compassion for those imperfections in yourself.For example, say to yourself, “I am not perfect in who I am or what I look like. I can accept myself despite these imperfections.” If one person finds you unattractive, so what? That doesn’t mean everybody sees you that way. Accept yourself as you are and remember that you can't please everybody.  If being called ugly has seared into your self-image and into your thoughts, it’s time to get it out. Focus on saying something to yourself that builds yourself up and puts positive thoughts into your mind. Think of affirmations that are in the present tense and try to say them every day. You might not believe the words at first, but keep with it and see how you feel.For example, say (or write down), “I am beautiful” or, “My worth is more than skin deep.”  , Start to raise your self-confidence. If you don’t know how to feel confident or don’t feel you can be confident, act like you have confidence. For example, ask yourself, “What would someone who is confident do now? How would they respond?” Start to see yourself as confident, even if you don’t believe you are. When people see you as a confident person, they may be less likely to make fun of you or insult you.As some people say, “Fake it ‘til you make it.” Soon enough, you’ll find that feeling confident gets easier and easier.  If you feel bad about yourself after someone calls you ugly, try doing something that makes you feel good about yourself. While you can’t instantly change the way you look, you can put your attention toward doing things that make you feel happy, calm, relaxed, or at ease. This can help you deal with the stress and feel better overall.For example, go for a walk, take a bath, write in a journal, or listen to music.  Put some effort into taking care of yourself. For example, practice good hygiene such as changing your clothes (including underpants and socks), showering regularly, brushing your teeth, and wearing deodorant. Practice taking care of yourself to feel more confident, such as taking time in the morning to make your hair look nice, dressing in clean clothes that reflect your style, and creating a look you like.Being called "ugly" is different from being called "not well taken care of". Take responsibility for your image and for things that you can change.  Whether you need support or someone to confide in, talking to an adult can help. This might be a teacher, parent, coach, or spiritual leader. They might lend a listening ear or give you some advice in how to handle situations when people try to hurt you. They might even help you intervene or confront the person who called you ugly.Adults remember being younger and may be able to give advice based on their own experiences.  If your ‘friends’ are teasing you or calling you ugly, take a second look at who you consider a friend. A true friend will support you and care about you, not tear you down or make fun of you. Choose to be around the friends who make you feel good. After all, winning over ‘cool’ friends who are mean to you will still leave you feeling bad.Even if you spend time with less ‘cool’ people, be with the people who treat you well, respect you, and don’t make you feel bad about yourself.  If you’re struggling with bullying, self-image, or self-esteem issues, a therapist can help you.Learn ways to cope with your feelings and build your self-esteem. If you struggle with anxiety or depression as a result of bullying or insults, your therapist can help you find ways to feel better about yourself.  Find a therapist by calling (or having your parents call) a local mental health clinic or your insurance provider. You can also get a recommendation from your physician or a friend.  

handle your anger.  ignore their words.  stand up for yourself.  turn their judgments into statements.  use humor.  value your own opinion above others.  look for beauty, not flaws.  accept yourself as you are.  use positive affirmations.  be confident in all that you do.  do things that make you feel good.  take care of your body.  talk to an adult.  be with your true friends.  see a therapist. 

 Ice cream made this way doesn't contain egg yolk, which makes it less rich and creamy than ice cream you may be used to. However, it is quick and easy to make, especially if you have a friend or two to help out. Kids often enjoy making this ice cream, since most of the process involves tossing it back and forth or shaking it.; , You can purchase pre-crushed ice, or make your own from ice cubes or blocks of ice. Place the ice in a plastic bag and gently, slowly bash the bag with a wooden mallet to break up the ice. Alternatively, use a heavy-duty food processor to break up the ice with brief pulses.  Use a large container that can be tightly closed, and that won't easily break when shaken around. You can buy an "ice cream ball" for this purpose, which is sturdy and fun to throw around, but you can easily use a gallon-sized zip lock bag or a large plastic jar instead.   The container must be large enough to contain the ice cream mixture as well as the ice. Use an even larger container if you are doubling the recipe.  Add 6 tablespoons (90 mL) rock salt directly onto the ice, seal the container, and shake until the salt and ice are mixed. It may seem strange, but the rock salt actually cools the ice down!Ice cream will not freeze in a container of regular ice, but salt provides the colder temperature it needs.   Rock salt is sometimes sold as "ice cream salt." Ordinary table salt can also be used, but the smaller grains may cool the mixture too rapidly, making your ice cream freeze unevenly.  Measure out 1 cup (240 mL) milk, 2 tablespoons (30 mL) sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) vanilla extract. Pour all of these ingredients into a quart- or liter-sized zip lock bag.   For a richer ice cream, use half-and-half or heavy cream instead of milk. If using an ice cream ball, pour this mixture into the compartment of the ball without ice instead. Skip straight to the "shake" step.  Hold the bag upright or have an assistant hold it for you. Press as much air as you can out of the bag, starting just above the level of the ingredients and moving up to the opening. Use the zip lock to seal the bag tightly.   The more air there is in the bag, the more likely the bag will be to burst open while you make the ice cream.  Open another bag of the same size or larger. Place the bag containing the ice cream mixture inside this additional bag, then seal the same way you did the first. Ice cream needs to be shaken during freezing, and using two bags will prevent it from spilling if one of the bags is broken during the shaking.  Seal the largest container tightly. It should now contain the double-bagged ice cream mixture as well as the loose ice and rock salt slush.  Shake the container vigorously, or if the container is sturdy enough and tightly sealed, toss it back and forth. This movement prevents large ice chunks from forming, and stirs a little air into the ice cream as well to make it less dense. The ice cream may take 5–20 minutes to freeze, depending on the temperature, how vigorously you are shaking, and how hard you prefer your ice cream. It may take longer if you are making a larger batch.   Wrap the container in towels or wear gloves if it gets too cold to handle. If the ice cream isn't ready after 20 minutes, add more ice and salt, or put in the freezer for no more than 5 minutes.  Once the ice cream has reached the consistency you enjoy, remove the bag of ice cream from the larger container.

 Don't be scared of what others will think - take pride in who you are instead and love yourself and your new style. As Adam Ant once said: "Ridicule is nothing to be scared of."; , Dandies are quite flamboyant in their fashion. Wear romantic clothing with a fashionable touch and develop your own style. Look into the history books (or Google if you wish) and find images of what dandies used to look like - both in the 19th century and the 80's. You can also read books and watch movies that have a more romantic image. Pick and choose what you like from history, art and, of course, your own imagination. Only you set the limits to your own dandy-ness.  Dandies set no limits to personal hygiene. There is absolutely nothing wrong with perfume - pick and choose from both the men and female fragrances.  The point is that you must take care of your hair. Never once will you see a dandy without good hair, and many of them will have grown their hair long.  Yes, you must. At least a little bit. Find your personal style and determine how far you want to go with it.  You must not only dress the part; the way you speak is a great part of your personality. Be confident, yet refined in your language, and find your own personal style. An English accent is wonderful, if you can pull it off. , Big issues like politics, economy and such should always be discussed with a smile and some emotional detachment, but when it comes to your love-life, fashion and other less important things, be dead serious and slightly more emotional.  Don't try to fill your new clothes with a new personality. You should still be yourself.  

be confident.  be fashionable.  groom yourself.  get a haircut, or let it grow.  use makeup.  learn how to speak properly.  be a gentleman.  ,  take serious things lightly, and light things seriously.  be who you are. 

 This will help your hair sway over your shoulder in a smooth, fluid motion. It is possible to flip hair with any texture, but the smoother your hair is, the more effective the motion will be.  If possible, try to make eye contact with them for a brief second. Do not overdo it, however, or you will be too obvious.  Start with a part of your hair draped over your shoulder. Place the back of your hand against your hair, and quickly flick your hand back at the wrist. This will cause your hair to flip over your shoulder.   This works best with hair that falls somewhere between your shoulders and your elbows. If your hair is too long or too short, it may not be as effective Use a small, less dramatic motion. This will help make it look more natural. If you try to make a huge show of your hair flip, and make a large gesture, you will look overly-dramatic and unnatural.  This was work with just about any length of ponytail, but it will be most effective with tails that reach your shoulder. Simply turn your head towards one shoulder, and very quickly sweep your head towards the other shoulder. To make your flick even more effective, try to dip your head down slightly as you reach the middle of your "turn." This creates a dip or curve that causes your ponytail to flip even more.   Depending on the length of your hair, you might end up catching someone in the face.  Hair flipping is often associated with sass and confidence. You can make yourself appear more confident by standing tall with your back straight and your head held high. 

make sure your hair is smooth and free of tangles.  make sure that the person you want to flirt with is looking at you.  use your hand to flip your hair back over your shoulder.  flip your ponytail.  be confident.  finished.  

 The first step of writing an opinion essay is figuring out what you believe and why you believe it. An opinion essay can be about anything. You can inform about why the city shouldn’t put a parking lot in what is now a park near your house or why it’s cruel to declaw cats, really—it can be about anything.   Sit down at your computer or with a pad of paper and write down a list of bullet points regarding what you believe regarding your issue. On a separate page or column, list why you believe each point. The “why” is crucial because publishing an opinion essay means communicating with strangers. Saying “All my friends believe this” or “Everyone knows this is true” isn’t really going to change any minds, but connecting through solid reasoning may.; , The lead paragraph introduces your topic, what you’re going to say. The next three paragraphs present stand-alone points, while the final paragraph sums it all up—emphatically.   Even a lengthy essay follows the same format: an opening section that introduces the subject, a body of facts and examples that support the contention, and a final section that summarizes in an impactful way.  It is crucial to grab the reader’s attention right out of the gate, and since humans are story-telling critters, a sure way to start strong is with a true-life incident that relates to your theme, to what you want to convey with your words. You undoubtedly have a personal connection to the issue because it is important to you. So, as a way to get your creative juices flowing, jot down memories and personal anecdotes that relate, then choose the one that flows most easily into your narrative, and is vividly memorable.  Step away from your own viewpoint and see the world from someone else's perspective in order to answer the question every reader will have: "What does this issue mean to me?" After all, it’s easy to spend time on websites and blogs where everyone (except for trolls, maybe!) agrees with the writers' particular world view. But the strongest opinion essays are written for readers who aren't familiar with the particular issue you're addressing or haven’t formed a strong opinion about it yet.   In your essay, try to find examples of how the issue you're addressing can touch other people's daily lives so that they can see your point of view through their own experiences.  Expressing an opinion without facts may give you a feeling of power or importance, but it rarely changes someone’s mind. Combining your opinion with facts is a far more effective way of reaching your readership and letting them come to their own conclusions. Instead of telling your readers what to think, present facts that will give them a reason to change their thinking.  If you’ve done your job right, then you’re ready for the best part of your essay. This is when you challenge your readers to do something. This doesn’t have to mean signing a petition or going on a march. Ask your readers to do something that’s simple and basic, but profound and meaningful in their own lives. Ask them to demonstrate the value of their new opinion, and help them by, once again, providing examples of actions they can take.  Show your essay to some friends or relatives before going public. By sharing your work, you can see whether you've succeeded in communicating what you intended to. Note that your test readers don’t necessarily need to agree with you, but they can tell you if you've effectively made your points.  After a rewrite or two of the main body of the essay, you’re ready to boil it down to one summarizing paragraph describing:   why you’ve written the essay what it’s about why someone might want to read it  , Once you’re done with the summary, you’re ready to publish your essay online.  As an example, consider Marni Halasa, a self-described “professional protester” in New York City. Marni has become skilled at using witty homemade costumes to attract attention to the issues that are important to her. . Marni has learned the first rule of political engagement: You need to project a quick visual message that will stop someone from walking away from you. Once people stop and look, they’re ready to listen.   Use images, just like the one of Marni Halasa (above). If you don’t have the budget for professional designer, download one of your own photos or get a free image from Shutterstock or a similar website. Remember: you’re looking for a visual image that’s both powerful and informative.  You’ve got your essay, a summary, and a great visual image; you’re ready to find readers. Here are some ways to do this:   You can put the essay up on your personal website. You can publish the essay in public opinion forums like Medium. You can publish it on Amazon and a variety of other eBook sites. You can offer sections of the essay, or the full thing, to publications by pitching to op-ed sections.  You have a choice. You can stay silent or express your opinion. Remember: Your actions can change both your environment and your life. Writing and publishing an opinion statement on the internet can make you feel active, powerful, and engaged with your world, ... and it can make a difference.  Start writing!  

distill the essence of what you believe.  rough in your argument with the standard five-paragraph essay.  get the readers attention by telling a story.  ask yourself what about your topic touches people's lives.  offer your readers facts and evidence.  present a call to action.  test your essay.  write a summary.  publish your essay.  draw attention to your essay by making visual impact.  find readers.  take action to express your opinion vividly.  go ahead! 

 Make sure you order from a pizza restaurant that accepts orders over the phone for delivery or pickup/takeout. Check the website for the pizza place, or call their phone number to briefly ask if they do deliveries or will let you order something in advance and pick it up when it’s ready.   If you want the pizza delivered, check to make sure that you live within an area that the pizza place will deliver to. If you’re outside the city limits of where the restaurant is, for instance, that may be beyond their maximum mileage for deliveries. Make sure you also have a type of payment that the pizza restaurant accepts. For instance, you will likely want to have cash for a delivery and not plan to use a check in stores that don’t accept them. Have several types of payments ready just in case.; , Choose whether you’d like to have your pizza delivered straight to your door, or simply go pick it up from the store location. Deliveries are great for convenience, while carry-outs are good when you’re on your way somewhere.   Note that the potential downside to delivery is that there may be an extra delivery fee added to the cost of your food, and unexpected delays can occur with your driver. The potential downsides to a pickup/carry-out order are that you have to get to the location to pick up the pizza yourself, which may take longer. This may be a particular challenge if you don’t own a car, can’t get a ride, or can’t use public transportation.  Consult an online or paper menu for the pizza place you wish to order from to make your selections. Or choose an item that is common or that you’ve ordered before, like a plain cheese pizza.   Consider pizza size, type of crust, toppings, and any other options available. You may need to ask how large a size of pizza is to determine what you’ll need, but otherwise the choices are entirely up to you. Look for menus online from most chain pizzerias. Take note if they have certain items that are only available in-store and not for delivery or takeout.  Don’t forget about drinks, appetizers, desserts, or any other dishes that you may want along with your pizza. Consult the menu to find out your options.   Also consider the specifications you may need to make when you order on the phone. Decide on a Small, Medium, or Large beverage, for example, or the kind of dressing you want on a salad if given the option. Take a look at the menu, website, or any promotional material you may have received or heard about that provides a special offer or discount on ordering other items with your pizza, or even additional pizzas. You might want to add to your order to take advantage of a deal.  Make placing the order easier for yourself and the person taking the order by knowing exactly what you want, which can be difficult with a large group of people or large order. Write it all down on a piece of paper you can look at while you’re on the phone.   Make sure everyone in a group comes to a firm agreement on the order before you place the call, and they understand they can’t make changes or additions once you’re on the phone. You can even go into another room to find some peace and quiet for the call if you need to.Don’t hesitate to write down any order, even if it’s a small one, as it can help you to remember and speak more clearly when on the phone.  

determine where to get your pizza.  decide on pickup or delivery.  choose your pizza and toppings.  choose drinks or any extras.  write down larger orders. 

 If your balcony is very small, consider turning it into a flower and herb garden. Mix up colorful perennials, seasonal delights, hardy ivies and herbs that you can use in the kitchen. Get a sturdy stool and a soft cushion for the seat so that you’ll enjoy working your own private garden.  Put plants that need sun up higher, and plants that like shade down lower. Fill in the corners with larger herbs such as rosemary or tomato plants.  Make sure you water regularly, fertilize your plants, and keep them trimmed. This will keep it looking like paradise. , One of the easiest way to make your balcony more comfortable is to add a chair or two and a small table. You’ll be able to have a place to sit and admire the view, have a pleasant conversation, or simply enjoy an afternoon snack.  If your balcony is long and skinny, consider a park bench, multi-purpose storage bench, or hanging porch swing, and add a side table for drinks, books, glasses, suntan lotion, and other friendly clutter.  While this may not be the focus of your balcony, plants add a personal, colorful touch that will really make your little retreat a welcoming, homey place.  There are several ways to approach this. If you have electrical outlets on your balcony, consider adding an inexpensive outdoor-rated lamp from the local hardware store, and use low-wattage bulbs for a warm and comfortable glow. You can also use a string of white outdoor Christmas tree mini lights strung up on the perimeter for an attractive effect. If you don’t have electricity available on your balcony, candles are a beautiful way to bring light to your retreat. Just make sure they are allowed by your covenant, and that you extinguish them whenever you leave the balcony.  The last thing you want is a soggy seat.  The flowers are pretty, and who doesn’t like a nice place to sit? But for you it's barbecue, friends, and libations all the way!  , Being mindful of apartment covenants, get the nicest barbecue that will fit your space. This will be the centerpiece of your balcony world, so do it right. Place it opposite the entry and exit doors if possible, so that you can make a quick dash from the barbecue to the kitchen in just a few steps.  Barbecues sometimes last well into the evening, so you’ll want to be sure you can see what you’re cooking. Either use floor lamp (make sure it’s rated for outdoor use), or a battery-powered barbecue lamp.  You’ll want a place to sit and talk about the game, the boss, and other deep topics.  Refrigeration is something to consider as well, if your covenant permits. A small outdoor refrigerator is a great place to keep beer, condiments, and other barbecue essentials cold and fresh. It also works well as a little countertop, so consider adding a heavy-duty cutting board on top of it.   Should you be unable to add a fridge, a cooler is a good alternative, and can function as an impromptu seat as well.  

enjoy the beauty of nature.  build in layers.  keep it fresh.  if you’re on the upper floors, make sure your plants are secured so they won’t be crashing onto your neighbors below.  ,  sit back, relax, and enjoy the view.  match your seating to the space.  add flowers, plants, and herbs, as room permits.  add lighting.  unless your balcony is enclosed, make sure any furniture you buy is adaptable to the elements.  take charge of your domain!,  start with the barbecue.  bring the light.  add a few stools.  chill!

 This four tones are denoted (in hanyupinyin format) by the symbols as: - / V \ . Basically, the tones follow the gradation of these symbols. For example, the first tone is represented by a horizontal dash (-), which means that there are no fluctuations of pitch; rather, the tone is held steady and high. The second tone (/) requires an upward rise in pitch, while the last tone (\) sounds as when you're extremely mad, it's the same tone as the word, "No!" when you're mad.

 These pills can be inserted into the rectum in order to stimulate a bowel movement if the need is necessary. Many people find these pills more comfortable than the enema method; however, they may not provide relief as quickly.  In severe cases, this can be used with milder methods as listed above. Read the directions carefully and make sure you are in a comfortable place within very close proximity to a bathroom.   Ready the enema according to package instructions. Lay on your side or with your buttocks slightly elevated. Insert the tip of the enema into the rectum and squeeze the liquid into the rectum. You do not need to empty the container. Stay in this position for one to five minutes, or until you feel the urge to use the bathroom. Use the bathroom repeatedly as needed. Call your doctor if you’ve used an enema, but haven’t had relief within 30 minutes. 

try a suppository.  move on to a rectal (liquid) enema, such as fleet brand, if you need immediate relief from constipation. 

 Not all hardships are the same. If the hardship your friend is experiencing is a threat to his or her safety – say a physically abusive relationship or threats of self-harm – you must act.   Encourage your friend to tell someone in a position of authority more equipped to know what to do, such as a law enforcement officer or a therapist or religious leader or parent. If the friend refuses, and there is abuse occurring, talk to a person in authority on your own. If the friend is underage, you need to tell their parent if they are suffering from abuse, including bullying. Bullying is emotional abuse, and you shouldn’t try to handle something like that on your own. Don’t try confronting the abuser, as that could put you in danger too. Tell an adult.  Don’t force them to cheer up or get angry if they can’t break out of their doldrums. They’re hurting. Sometimes they just need to wallow in it for a bit. But if the wallowing is going on for an excessive amount of time, you should try other responses.   There comes a time when you might need a little tough love or you become an enabler. When is that point? When a significant amount of time has passed, and their continued sadness, grief, or depression is starting to have negative ramifications in other areas of their life, like work or school. At first wallowing is natural. Later on, not so much, although how much time that means is individual. At some point, direct them toward considering solutions.  If you need space from the issue at a certain point because they aren’t healing and every conversation is about wallowing in sadness month after month, you might need to suggest a tougher intervention.   Learn the signs of clinical depression , and if your friend has it, suggest getting help from a professional, such as a therapist or doctor. Remind them that you are not trained to be their therapist. Nor can you carry their problems on your shoulder forever. At a certain point, a little tough love in the form of a constructive solution or an honest reckoning of what you observe can help them more.  Try to find ways to distract them from the issue for awhile. Maybe ask them to go to a movie with you. It will get them out of the house, and they will forget about their troubles for a few hours at least.   Distractions help a person gain perspective. Balance the wallowing and the distraction, though. Understand, at least in the beginning, that they might want to sit in their livingroom in a pair of pajamas instead. Get them some comfort food like ice cream or chocolate or their favorite foods. Bring it over to their house, and keep them company. Remind them of their achievements. Share a positive quote. To some degree carrying on with life as usual at a certain point can be healing for people. So don’t vary routines too much.  When a friend confides in you about a hardship, they are conveying a sense of trust in you. If you violate that trust by sharing their business elsewhere, you aren’t a good friend.   The exception – and this really important – is for situations involving abuse, bullying, or any circumstance in which your friend is in danger, including emotionally. In those cases, you must tell someone in authority – a parent, a cop, or a therapist, for example. In other situations, don’t be a gossip. Don’t allude to their problems on social media or tell other people in your circle of friends, even if it’s under the guise of trying to get them more help.  

report abuse or any issue that could affect your friend’s safety.  let them be sad for awhile, but not forever.  understand when this is getting out of your league.  distract them by doing something fun.  keep their problems private so you don’t make it worse if they are not in danger. 

 Sweet potatoes come in varied shapes and sizes. For noodles, however, favor longer, thinner ones that are relatively uniform in thickness from end to end. As a model, pick those that most closely resemble zucchinis.The more uniform your sweet potato is in thickness, the more uniform your noodles will be.; , Expect the flesh of these to be more brittle. This means that it’s more likely to break apart, so steer clear of them in order to avoid noodles that snap in two. Discard any sweet potatoes that:Have dark spots on the skin.Have any growths developing on the skin. Feel soft to the touch. Leak moisture and/or feel damp.  Remember: you don't want to use overripe sweet potatoes for this, so for the best results, make your noodles right after purchase. Otherwise, expect them to last between three to five weeks when stored in the pantry. So err on the side of caution and make your noodles within the next three weeks.If needed, you can store them in the fridge to make them last longer. Refrigeration should make them last between two and three months.  If you’ve ever handled a sweet potato before, you probably know that the flesh is pretty hardy. Expect the skin to be pretty darn tough on its own, too, which can make them turning into noodles tougher. Make life easier and skin each one with a potato peeler.Even though you’re peeling them, wash each one under cold running water before you start. The blade of your peeler can transfer dirt and chemicals to the flesh if you don’t., First, choose between your spiralizer’s noodle blade (which will make noodles similar in shape to spaghetti) or its spiral blade (which will make curly noodles).Refer to your make and model’s instructions on how to properly attach your blade and operate the machine, since these vary. Generally speaking though, you prop the sweet potato lengthwise between the blade and the handle, then crank the handle to force the potato through the blade.Expect sweet potatoes to require applying more pressure than other vegetables do.If needed, slice off both ends to the potato before you start so they’re both flat. If you don’t have a spiralizer, you can shred them with a julienne peeler instead., Coat the bottom of a large skillet with olive oil. Turn the heat to medium-high. Once the oil heats up, place your noodles in the pan. Stir them around in the oil to coat them, and/or use a pair of tongs to toss them. Stir or toss frequently as you cook. For crisper noodles, remove after five minutes. For softer ones, saute them for ten minutes., Preheat your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (219 degrees Celsius). Spray a roasting pan with cooking oil. Spread your noodles in the pan and mist them with your cooking spray. Place the pan in the oven and roast for 10 to 12 minutes., First, place your cashews in a bowl, cover them with water, and let them sit for a couple hours or more (the longer they soak, the softer they’ll get). Drain them in a strainer and then place them in a food processor or blender. Pulse to chop them up a bit, then add your salt, garlic, and ¾ cup of water. Blend until it smoothes to an evenly creamy texture. Then:Season with salt, pepper, and herbs to taste. Place your spinach in the skillet after you remove your cooked noodles. Add your cream to the skillet once the spinach wilts. Add water if needed to thin the cream if it sticks to the pan. Stir everything up, top your noodles, and drizzle with olive oil if desired.  In addition to the sweet potatoes that you’re using for your noodles, pick up an extra one or reserve 1 cup’s worth (210 g). Chop it into chunks and steam 1 cup's worth. Roast your red pepper. Place those in a blender or food processor. Add your milk, basil, garlic, and salt. Blend until the texture turns creamy.Be aware that the combined steam from your potatoes and peppers can force the lid to your blender out of position. Either wait for them to cool off or hold the lid in place as you blend. Once the noodles cook, pour the sauce into the skillet. Stir or toss to coat them evenly. Then cover and cook for another two minutes before serving.  Add your peanut butter to a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for about half a minute, or until it melts. Remove from microwave and add your water, soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, garlic, ginger, and lime juice. Whisk until they are evenly mixed. Pour the sauce over the noodles in the skillet once they’ve cooked, then stir or toss until they’re evenly coated. 

pick longer, thinner sweet potatoes.  avoid overripe potatoes.  prepare within the next three weeks at most.  skin your potatoes.  spiralize your sweet potatoes.  saute them in a skillet.  roast them instead, if desired.  try a spinach-cashew cream.  make a sauce with roasted red pepper and extra sweet potato.  microwave a peanut sauce. 

 Rolex watches are expensive to replace and repair, so protect your watch by winding it on a stationary surface where it can't slip out of your hand.; , The crown is located on the side of your watch by the 3 o'clock marking. Turn the crown counterclockwise until you feel it release from the last thread. It will pop out slightly from the side of the watch.  With your thumb and index finger, slowly turn the crown clockwise 360 degrees, or a full rotation, at least 30 to 40 times. This fully winds the watch.          If you only rotate the crown clockwise a few times then the watch will not be fully wound. Rolex designs its watches so it is impossible to over wind them. A device built into the watch will prevent you from over winding the Rolex.  Return the crown to its normal position by gently pushing the crown towards the watch and screwing it back on to the threads by turning it clockwise. Your Rolex watch is now wound.  If you've wound your watch and it doesn't immediately start working, leave it alone for a little while or rotate it back and forth on your wrist. It may take a little motion for the watch to be working properly.  A Rolex watch that stays motionless for approximately 24 hours will usually not wind itself and will need to be manually wound. Keep your Rolex on if you don't want to repeatedly wind it.  If your Rolex still doesn't work after winding it, you may have a more serious problem.

 Teens who are considering suicide may demonstrate acting-out behaviors that are drastically out of character. They may also have an attitude of ambivalence or apathy. These behaviors may be self-destructive in nature like engaging in unprotected sex or drinking and driving. If you notice any reckless behavior in your teen that seems more pronounced than normal, take notice., Many teens who are thinking about suicide give warning signs such as a strange preoccupation with death. Your teen may write poems or songs about death or loss. They might be obsessed with films or TV shows that have undertones about death.  They might also be preoccupied with what happens after death, such as the afterlife.  If your teen makes inferences about going away or seems to be saying “goodbye” to loved ones, they may have a plan to commit suicide. Other signs might include them giving their prized possessions away to siblings or friends, or simply throwing them away. They may even ask to visit all their relatives.This sort of behavior is common in teens who have a clear plan to harm themselves. Therefore, you should get your teen professional help right away to keep your teen safe. Also, avoid leaving your teen alone if you notice this behavior. Other similar forms of the behavior might include refusing to make plans for the near or distant future, or refusing to commit to things.  A teen who has made the decision to take their own life may totally drop out of the social scene. They no longer have an interest in hanging out with friends and try to skip family gatherings. If you notice a generally outgoing teen who starts to pull away from friends and family, this could be a warning sign., Another warning sign associated with teen suicidal behavior is an overall neglect of their lives. Teens who were once incredibly interested in their appearance no longer seem to care if their hair is unkempt and too long. Their grades drop significantly at school. They dodge extracurricular practice and make up excuses as to why they aren’t participating. 

watch for risk-taking behavior.  listen for a preoccupation with death.  find out if your teen has been giving away belongings.  look for social withdrawal.  pay attention to declines in appearance, activities, and academics. 

 If more than one cat goes to one bowl at meal time, you should coax the cat away who does not normally eat at that bowl. This could be done by picking the cat up, calling to it, or luring it towards its own bowl with a bit of food. This separation will prevent territorial disputes and conflict during meal time.  There can be power dynamics between cats that they need to sort out themselves. When cats are initially establishing whose dish is whose, there may be some switching up that occurs.  When fights break out over territory or food you should break them up right away. Fighting over food, especially between cats who usually get along, can lead to unhealthy aggression, so it should be stopped before it gets serious.If you have two cats that repeatedly fight over food dishes, these cats should be fed in different rooms.  In order to have a peaceful household with multiple cats, you may need to resort to keeping certain cats away from each other most of the time, which includes meal time. This will allow you to avoid conflict before it begins and it allows both cats to have peaceful and calm time in their homes.  If you have a very small home, this can be difficult to achieve. Keeping cats that don't get along separated works better if you have a large house or at least several rooms that can be closed off. While it is true that some cats may have conflict at first and then learn to get along, that is not always the case. If you have tried to get your cats to get along and nothing seems to work, it may be time to give them separate territories in your home. 

coax cats to their own bowls.  stop fights right away.  avoid conflict before it starts. 

 If you plan for this to be a total switch, keep in mind that you may go from the first chair clarinet player and one of the best players in your band to the last chair tenor and weak link of the band for a while, and you'll be learning everything but reading music all over again. If you think you're up for it, though, go ahead and proceed.; , Purchase or borrow a tenor sax in decent condition and all the things necessary to play and maintain it. If you're in a school band, the school will probably have an instrument that you can rent, or you can rent one on a rent-to-own program at your local music store. You will also need a method book or two, preferably the same one you used to learn the clarinet., Put the neck strap on, pick it up, and just walk around with it to get a feel for the weight, size, and different angle of the mouthpiece. Figure out where your fingers are supposed to go. The right hand should be obvious, but there are 5 mother of pearl keys on the upper part of the instrument. Your fingers go on the second, fourth, and fifth ones, in the same way they would on the clarinet. Think of the first one as the A key on the clarinet, and the third one as the little lever that you use to play low Eb and high Bb., If you study a fingering chart for the tenor sax, you'll see a lot of similarities to the upper register clarinet fingerings. For instance, thumb, register (octave, on the sax), and five tone holes produces a high E, just as it would on a clarinet.   The key above the thumb key is the octave key, which makes notes higher, just like the clarinet's register key, except it takes them up a whole octave, hence the name. If you finger an E and hit the octave key on the sax, you get a high E, unlike the clarinet, where all the fingerings have two names. The three keys at the top of the instrument are operated by your left hand, and are mainly used for notes above the staff (D, D#, E, and F). There are four keys with rollers between them that are operated by your left pinky finger, about the same place as the 4 "left pinky" keys on the clarinet. On saxophone, this is commonly referred to as the "table," or "spatula keys." L - R: Two bottom keys with rollers (see below), offset key, three aligned keys. View from in case.]]There are four keys on the side of the bottom of the sax that are operated by your right hand. Three are in a row, and one is nestled further in. The top key is used in conjunction with the left hand side keys, and plays high E. The middle one is used as a trill fingering for middle C, and the bottom of the three aligned ones is used for one fingering of Bb. There are two keys at the bottom of the sax with rollers between them that are operated by your right pinky. The top one makes an Eb, and the bottom makes a low C. Think of them as the equivalent of the top two of the four keys at the bottom of the clarinet.  You'll soon pick up on the many similarities and will be playing simple music within just a few minutes. Different methods start with different notes, but most suggest starting with the higher notes. As a starting point, you might want to try the notes below. Many simple tunes can be played with only E, D, and C, and F and G just add to the fun. You'll notice how most of these fingerings are the same as the ones for the upper register of the clarinet.   Top space E: Octave key and first five mother-of-pearl keys. Fourth-line D: Octave key and all six mother-of-pearl keys. Third space C: Only the second mother-of-pearl key (covered by your left middle finger) Top-line F: Octave key and first four mother-of-pearl keys. G on top of the staff: Octave key and top three mother-of-pearl keys.  Releasing the octave key on the G, F, E, and D fingerings produces the same note, but an octave lower. Pressing the octave key for the C sounds a C, but an octave higher.  As you experimented with the fingering chart, you may have noticed that the octave key doesn't seem to be "working." When you finger a D, the sound is the same with or without the octave key. This is common with clarinet players switching to tenor. It'll take some practice to be able to play low notes well, but it's also considerably due to your embouchure. A clarinet requires a tight embouchure, but a tenor saxophone requires a looser one. Adjusting the position of your tongue in your mouth is crucial to gaining full range on the saxophone. The tongue placement varies based on the range, for example: when playing low notes, your tongue will be low in your mouth. The tongue rests in the middle part of the mouth when playing in the middle and high ranges. When teachers say "Drop your jaw for low notes," this is really what is going on; the placement of the tongue and the jaw coming off of the reed permits it to vibrate at a lower frequency. You may also need to adjust the amount of lip you have rolled over your teeth. Saxophone experts generally say that about 2/3 of your bottom lip should be rolled in. Experiment and practice until your low notes sound as good as your high ones.  Over time, you'll be just as good at the saxophone as you are at the clarinet.  

be sure that you really want to switch to tenor sax.  a used tenor saxophone in its case with all the things needed to play and clean it.]],  assemble a tenor saxophone|assemble the saxophone]].  familiarize yourself with the keys and fingerings, and see how they relate to the clarinet's mechanism.  play a few notes -- you'll need a fingering chart for this.  adjust your embouchure.  once you've gotten good at the tenor sax and made the commitment to stick with it, ask your director for tenor sax music and start practicing.

 Operant conditioning includes two types of reinforcement.  Positive reinforcement - Most trainers who use positive reinforcement also use "negative punishment", which means they take away something the dog wants to reduce behavior that the trainer doesn't want (for example turning away from a dog who is jumping up for attention).

Whatever you do...be consistent. Another idea for grabbing your pet's attention is to thump your foot or hand so that they can feel the vibrations.  For example, when your pet sits, give the 'yes' signal and reward. The signal and reward let your animal know that they did something good.

Alcohol increases the amount of acid your stomach produces, and can lead to ulcers, acid reflux and other issues. Alcohol can also cause vomiting and diarrhea., Stomach aches can be caused by stress, anxiety, or depression. Try to reduce your stress level. Try exercising for 30 minutes each day with a long walk or jog. You can also reduce your caffeine and sugar intake, which can both lower anxiety and help your stomach feel better.   Consider talking with a counselor if you are dealing with a lot of stress or anxiety.  If your stomach pains are caused by menstrual cramps, you will want to have plenty of rest. In addition, you will want to avoid alcohol, caffeine and smoking., The use of medicines, herbal remedies and/or lifestyle changes are not substitutes for medical care. Given that stomach aches can point to serious problems, it is vital that you know which symptoms to take seriously and know when to see a doctor.  If you are experiencing severe stomach pain that makes you unable to sit still, or if you need to curl into a ball to find relief, you need to visit the emergency room. This is especially true if the pain is on the right side of your abdomen. You should also visit the emergency room or see your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms:   Stomach pain with bloody stool, persistent nausea and vomiting, skin that appears yellow, swelling in your abdomen, or tenderness in your abdomen.If you have stomach pain after an injury or car accident. See your doctor right away if you have stomach pain and suspect you may be pregnant.a  , If your stomach ache persists for a few days or begins to worry you, it is time to see a doctor. You should also call your doctor is you have heartburn that lasts for several weeks with no improvement from over the counter medicine. Also, call your doctor if the stomach pain is accompanied with fever and headache, poor appetite, weight loss, or pain with urination.  You should also call your doctor if cramping is severe. 

consider over-the-counter children's drugs with medical advice.  take a non-aspirin pain reliever for general stomach pain.  take an over-the-counter antacid or acid reducer for heartburn.examples of antacids or acid reducers include zantac, prilosec, and nexium.  take a laxative or stool softener if you are experiencing constipation.constipation is defined as having infrequent bowel movements or difficulty having a bowel movement.  try acetaminophen, ibuprofen or naproxen for menstrual cramps.  try drinking a cup of herbal tea.  try a mix of yogurt and fruit juice.  drink apple cider vinegar to ease indigestion.  eat ginger.  try placing a heating pad or a hot water bottle on your stomach.  avoid certain foods.  eat healthy foods and drink water to help with belly pain.  eliminate foods that cause gas.  avoid overeating.  avoid alcohol.  reduce stress and anxiety.  get plenty of rest and live healthy while having menstrual cramps.  understand that stomach aches may be serious.  visit the emergency room immediately with severe and unrelenting pain.  call your doctor if you have stomach pain lasting several days.  call your doctor if you have cramps associated with menstrual pain that last longer than three days. 

 An emoticon is an icon used to represent an emotion.  Look up the character codes online. For example, holding the Alt button while typing the number 074 on a numeric keypad will result in a smiling face emoticon, while typing the number 076 while holding down the Alt button will result in a sad-faced emoticon.  

determine which type of emoticon you wish to use.  use character code to represent a symbol. 

 Run the pads of your fingers over your tongue just enough to moisten them slightly. Most people prefer to use their thumb and forefinger, but any two fingers will suffice. The idea is to wet them just enough to stifle the candle with a light touch.Wetting your fingers will also help protect your skin from the heat of the flame. If there’s a source of water nearby (like a sink or drinking glass), you can prepare your fingers that way, as well.  In one rapid motion, grasp the wick between your two fingers. The moisture should cause the flame to die as soon as you make contact. Make sure you let go immediately so as not to take any chances.You may feel a warm sensation momentarily. Once the flame is out, however, the heat will dissipate almost instantly. The sizzling sound you hear is nothing to worry about—it’s just the moisture on your fingertips evaporating.  Needless to say, attempting to extinguish a candle wick with exposed fingers is risky, since it requires you to actually touch it. Always exercise the utmost caution anytime you bring any part of your body close to a burning candle. If the flame doesn’t go out, try again or give a different method a shot.  Practice a few times on an unlit candle (with dry fingers) before you try for real. The inherent danger of using your fingers to put out a candle makes this more of a neat party trick than a practical everyday solution.  

lick the tips of your fingers.  pinch and release the wick quickly.  be careful not to burn yourself. 

 Comfy clothing will feel much less restricting, and therefore better when working in a space for thirty minutes or more. If you feel cut off from moving, you're more likely to become agitated or upset.   Scientific studies show that tight or restricting clothing can caused mood swings.; , Whether you want to feel relaxed with some classical melodies or rock out and feel great with EDM tunes, go for it. Whatever you feel most comfortable and/or most effective listening to whilst cleaning your bedroom, set it up   If you don't have a ton of music, look for a free playlist on your computer to play. You can also use the free apps Spotify, Pandora, or iHeartRadio on a mobile device.  You'll most likely be less frustrated if you have everything at the palm of your hand and reader to go. Leave the items in your door frame or in another easily-accessible arena.   A duster, a can of Pledge (or another brand of wood protector), antibacterial wipes, a bottle of window cleaner, and a microfiber (or otherwise soft) cloth are all good basics to hit. If you don't already have them in your room, grab a trash bin and a hamper/dirty clothing bucket.  

put on comfortable clothes.  set some music.  set up your supplies. 

 Make sure they have enough time to defrost. You don’t want to defrost tougher pieces of meat, like this, in the microwave.; , There are several marinades that work well with short ribs, including red wine, dark beer and Asian-style ribs. If you’re using the red wine marinade above, mix together the red wine, beef broth, garlic, tomatoes, bay leaves, black pepper and thyme.  Place your defrosted beef flanken ribs in the bag. Seal it and flip the bag several times to coat the meat.  The longer they marinate, the more intensely flavored they will be.  Pat them dry with some paper towels. Reserve the marinade.   Dry beef will brown better.  of olive oil in a Dutch oven on medium heat. Place the flanken into the heated pan to brown. Brown for three minutes on each side.  Remove all but two tbsp. of oil from the pan.  Toss them in the Dutch oven and sauté them in the oil until browned. Loosen any brown bits with your wooden spoon.  Pour in the reserved marinade. Heat until boiling.  Reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook at this low temperature for one and a half hours to two hours.  Set them aside and keep them warm.  Separate the fat if possible, or use the full-fat reduction as sauce. Serve immediately. 

defrost the ribs for a day in the refrigerator.  mix a marinade.  pour the marinade into a sealable plastic sack.  place the bag in the refrigerator for four hours.  remove the ribs from the refrigerator and the plastic bag.  heat two tbsp.  remove the ribs from the dutch oven and place them on a platter.  dice an onion, two large carrots and two celery stalks.  place the ribs inside the dutch oven.  secure the lid on the top of the dutch oven.  remove the ribs from the pot.  bring the remaining juice to a boil and reduce it by half. 

 If you are only going for an hour or two, you probably don't need to bring much. If you are going for over 2 hours, you may want to bring all of these suggested items.; , You might want to think about a waterproof bag.  One may fall in the pool or get dirty, and you don't want to rub dirt all over yourself. Even if nothing like that happens, it never hurts to have a spare. A friend may have forgotten to bring one, and you could loan them yours.  You don't want to go to the pool all day and end up bright red the next day. If you want to tan, try bringing a lower SPF, like 15. If you burn easily, you may want to get a higher SPF, such as 50. If you need it, they do make SPF 100.  Again, if you have two pairs, bring both. If a pair snaps or one falls to the bottom of the pool, you could use the other pair.  Bring a cooler with water, nuts, fruits, vegetables, and other healthy snacks. Unhealthy snacks may taste good, but they won't fuel your body as long or fill your stomach enough. It also may be a good idea to bring Gatorade or "Powerade", as these energize you and replace your electrolytes. , If you are a child, it will give you something to do during adult swim. Also, you could read on a bench and tan while you read.  You don't want to have your eyes be damaged by the sunlight, and the hat protects your face more.  

consider how long you will be at the pool.  acquire a bag big enough to hold everything you'll need.  pack 2 towels.  bring sunscreen!,  if you need them, bring goggles.  bring healthy snacks.  bring a cover-up, if necessary.  ,  pack a book.  bring sunglasses and a hat with a brim. 

 For instance - your Grandmother made you a sewing basket when you were four? Hide your money in there! There's a bunch of children's books in your bookcase? Chuck all secret notes between the pages! A jewelry box you painted when you were six? Hide small candies or money in it! You can even hollow out a big book and hide stuff in there! Here are some other good places people might think to look, but wouldn't expect you to hide stuff there;   Vents (just make sure the stuff won't burn and start a fire when the heater goes on.) Also be careful of dust. If you have a box of unused stuffed animals, use that!; , If you have a cell phone with a cover on it, that could be a great hiding place. Just put anything thin like money or notes in between the back of the phone and the cover.   Inside of your desk, behind the drawers.  For instance, most game systems such as Play Station 2 (the thick one) and Game Cubes have places that open up. You can put things in them.  If you have an old board game box, you can throw away the stuff inside it and hide your things in there.  This works if you have one that is plugged into the wall, but one that runs on batteries can do just as well. Most of these either take a few large batteries or many smaller ones. Just take the battery cover off and put whatever small thing you need to hide in there, then close the battery cover back up. Be careful in case you might need to use the radio on batteries. If you know when it'll need to be on batteries, move your stuff prior to use. Also, if it's a hard object, it may rattle inside should the radio be moved. This can arouse suspicion. To test, put the object in, and close it up, then shake the radio a little. If you hear any noise, take the object out and wrap it in some tissue or cloth or something similar, and then replace it in there. Or if you have an old one that doesn't work, take out the insides and place your item in there and then screw the back on again but make sure you don't take off the buttons, otherwise it will be obvious!  , Then bury it in your fish tank, assuming you have one. No one would think to look in your fish tank with all your fish around. Plus there is no chance of any smells getting out for someone to discover. You can also hide rolled up notes in an empty lipstick.  

remnants of childhood are good places to start.  phones.  another good place for hiding small items is in battery compartments and/or other things like that.  if you want your room to seem normal, you can hide secret items such as notes or letters or candy in places like inside a picture frame behind the picture, inside the pocket of an old jacket in your closet, or in a fake trash can.  you can also use your radio.  a great place to hide something small is to get a waterproof container, available at any dive shop or online. 

 This software will generally allow you to automatically handle a wide variety of passwords (for applications and websites) by simply entering one "master" password—significantly more simple., Specific instructions will vary depending on which program you select, so be sure to follow instructions carefully. Generally speaking, you'll need to visit the appropriate vendor website and click a "download" button before following the installation instructions associated with your operating system.  Again, the process will vary depending on the specific program. But the basic idea is to set up a complex master password that allows the production and/or maintenance of multiple, site and application-specific passwords to access their destinations. Most popular programs are pretty user-friendly when it comes to core functionality.  Most of the best password managers will give you the option to either use your master password locally or synced across a variety of devices, so be prepared to determine what works best for you. You can also generally decide whether you wish the program to automatically log you in to sites and whether it audits your distinct passwords to ensure they're sufficiently different and changed on a regular basis.  

select a password management program.  download and install a password manager.  set up your password manager.  customize your preferences. 

 Write a thoughtful, accurate article about your experience with immunization and how it helped you or your family to demonstrate the importance of immunization. Talk to your local newspaper about the possibility of publishing it.   If your op-ed or article is not selected for publication, you could easily self-publish on your blog or social media page. If you do not have time or ability to construct a full-length article, you could still educate people on the the importance of immunizations by writing a letter to your editor.  Parents with babies should receive information that is unique from information provided for parents of teens.   Similarly, you should always provide information specific to certain diseases. If someone is considering vaccination against diphtheria, do not provide them with information about shingles vaccination.  Immunization can be confusing, and people might have questions about what vaccines they need, when they need them, and what the manufacturing process behind vaccines is.If you cannot answer a question, be honest and admit that you don’t know. However, you should add that you’ll find out and get back to the person, or direct them to a medical professional or another reputable source that can answer their question.  Instead of expecting people to take you at your word, you should always redirect them to other, reputable sources of information about immunization. There are a wide variety of public and private agencies and organizations that specialize in providing accurate information about the importance of immunization, including:The American Association of Family Physicians, which offers policy statements and recommendations about getting immunized. They are online at http://www.aafp.org/patient-care/public-health/immunizations/schedules.html. Vaccines.gov, a website run by the Department of Health and Human Services that provides information on many vaccines and when to get immunized. The Immunization Action Coalition, a nonprofit dedicated to improving public health through education on the importance of immunization. Check them out online at http://www.immunize.org.  In many cases, more information or education that dispels anti-vaccination myths can push people -- especially those who are already suspicious about immunizations -- to more extreme positions.Go into any conversation with an understanding that some people are immune to education, and don’t blame yourself for failing to change their mind. Know when to give up the fight.  

publish an article about the importance of vaccines.popular articles in reputable newspapers, magazines, and online have the potential to reach more people than public service announcements and statements issued by medical organizations.  provide relevant materials.the information you provide should be tailored to the individual’s situation.  encourage questions.armed with accurate and scientifically verifiable information, you should have no reason not to invite and answer questions.  provide follow-up materials.  recognize the limits of education. 

 Take a few extra days or weeks to get information, ask and answer questions and set up a meaningful plan. Creating a thorough plan will help you to avoid problems in execution of a service or contract.; , Be honest about the products you can provide, without hyperbole. People often suggest that you under-promise in order to give the appearance of value if you provide more than what was expected.  You probably don't have the time and money to over-deliver on projects by a large margin; however, it is all about creating value. Deliver a little bit more so that your client feels they get something free or extra with their dollar.  Setting a deadline is effectively making a promise. If possible, set your personal delivery deadline to a day or 2 before the deadline, in case of unforeseen problems.   Assume that late work will cost your client money, when they have to delay plans. This extra cost brings down the value of your product. It is likely to come up when they reevaluate your business relationship.  If you are in need of clients, you may feel as if you can adjust your services slightly to provide them a good product. Be honest and do not accept a contract if you will not fulfill their needs, because you may be creating an unsatisfied customer from the beginning.  Ultimately, the customer will come back if your service was successful for them. Ask the client how their business initiative turned out and if there are any changes they would make next time.   Following up and getting facts about your service will help you to catch any frustrations or unhappiness that a client may feel uncomfortable about calling you and telling you. Customers often change who they work with because of seemingly small frustrations that were never addressed. Some businesses conduct surveys, but you may want to take a more personal approach with big accounts.  

include planning time in your cost and time estimates.  never over-promise.  over-deliver when it's important.  stick to the deadline.  ensure that you offer the services they need.  follow up. 

 Avocados don’t ripen until they’ve been picked, so you can store unripe avocados at room temperature on your counter for up to seven days while they ripen.   Place unripe avocados in a fruit bowl or basket and store them at room temperature. You can either leave them on the counter or put them away in a pantry.Start checking for ripeness after three or four days.  Ripe avocados should be transferred to the refrigerator if they aren't being used immediately. Refrigeration will slow the ripening process. Ripe avocados can be stored at cool temperatures for between three and five days.   Refrigerated avocados should be stored in a plastic bag., As soon as you cut into an avocado, regardless of whether it’s ripe or not, the green flesh inside will begin to turn brown. This happens with many fruits, and it’s a result of being exposed to oxygen. To help slow the process, store the avocado in the refrigerator for one to two days. You can further slow the process by:Storing the avocado in an air-tight container with some chopped onion. Wrapping the avocado tightly with plastic wrap, with the wrap touching the flesh. Sprinkling cut or mashed avocado with an acidic agent, such as lemon or lime juice, tomato juice, orange juice, or vinegar. Store the fruit in an air-tight container.  Ripe avocado can be stored in the freezer for up to six months. To prepare the fruit, peel the avocado, remove the pit, and dice the flesh into small cubes. Sprinkle the cubes with ½ tablespoon (10 ml) of lemon or lime juice. Transfer to an air-tight container and place it in the freezer.   As an alternative, you can also puree the avocado with lemon juice and freeze the puree. 

keep unripe avocados on the counter.  refrigerate ripe avocados.  prevent cut avocados from turning brown.  freeze avocados for long-term storage. 

 A small project can involve making a mini-hothouse using a plastic tub about 2 by 3 feet (61 by 91 cm) in size.   Clean the tub thoroughly and line the bottom of the tub with pebbles to keep water away from the potted plants you will place on top of the pebbles. Fill pots with potting soil and add a few seeds. Sprinkle a little potting soil over the seeds and water lightly. Place plastic wrap over the tub and put it into a sunny spot. Water periodically when the soil becomes dry, but take care not to over-water; just be sure the soil is kept moist. Remove the wrap when the plants are 2 inches (5 cm) in height. Allow the plants to grow uncovered until the weather and conditions are right to transplant them into your regular garden.; ,   Choose a spot that receives 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily. Be sure you have easy access to water. Find a site protected against prevailing north winds. Purchase a greenhouse or hothouse kit or build one yourself using a frame, glass, Plexiglas or plastic film. You can find plans online or in how-to magazines or books. Determine the floor you want. It could be concrete, dirt or gravel, for example. Concrete or brick will help hold the heat, but could cause mold and bacteria to grow because they also retain moisture. Gravel will allow for good drainage, but will not be as warm.    If you are depending upon solar heat, provide a way to vent air should it become too hot. Louvered windows or flaps you can raise or lower will provide ventilation. Consider using a shade cloth to keep temperatures down during very hot days. You may choose to install a heating system to keep temperatures constant. Your hothouse may need to have access to electricity. Attaching your hothouse to your home will let you heat it using your home heating system. Keep the temperature at about 80 degrees F (27 degrees C). Anything hotter or colder will not allow optimum growth. Keep air fresh by allowing for ventilation. Don't make your hothouse airtight. Keep humidity levels up by using a misting system or by using tubs of water in the hothouse to add moisture to the air.    Tomatoes and cucumbers will need feeding each time you water. Other plants may need less. Check with a local professional gardener or online to learn about recommended watering and feeding levels for the types of plants you are growing.    Plan your year's vegetable crops before placing your order so your hothouse garden will be well thought-out. If you choose to transplant seedlings outdoors, do so according to your climate zone.    Check on the progress of your vegetables, make adjustments to the amount of heat, ventilation, and light. Take care of daily routines such as watering and fertilizing. You can stop small problems from becoming crop failures by catching plant illness, infestations, and other problems early, before they've done irreparable damage to your plants.  

make a mini-hothouse to get a head start on your garden.  decide on the materials and location for your larger hothouse.  decide how your hothouse will be heated.  water and fertilize as needed according to the types of plants you are growing and what they require to thrive.  order or purchase seeds from a reputable garden center.  walk through your greenhouse or hothouse daily. 

 Prepare the chocolate pudding as directed on the box. Don't place in individual containers—put all the pudding in one bowl, and cover with a layer of plastic wrap on the surface of the pudding (to prevent a crust). Let it set in the fridge until chilled.; , Crush the Oreo cookies by putting them in a plastic bag and rolling over them with a rolling pin. Divide the crushed cookies into two bowls.  Take about two tablespoons of the pudding from the fridge and mix it with one of the bowls of crushed Oreo cookies. Add more pudding if needed, but keep the mixture fairly dry.  Flatten out some of the cookie mix into the bottom of each dessert bowl. Use a large spoon to do this. How much you use will depend on how big your dessert dishes are, and how many dishes you are making. Generally, you'll want to aim for about one heaping tablespoon of dirt per bowl.  Dish the chocolate pudding from the fridge into all the dessert bowls, being extra careful not to disturb the cookie mixture on the bottom.  Sprinkle the remaining crushed Oreos onto the top of the pudding mix, so it looks like dirt and mud. Use as much as you like!  , Be creative, put some in halfway and others lying on the top. Have fun with it.  Store your Mud and Worms pudding in the fridge to keep it cold until you are ready to serve it to guests.  

whip up some mud.  make dirt.  add texture to the mud.  plant the soil.  pour on the mud.  add a layer of topsoil.  put the gummy worms into the pudding.  keep the worms chill. 

 You will need a container for the distilled water, a plastic sheet and a shovel. You may also want some plastic tubing.  Dig a hole about as large as the plastic sheet and deep enough so that when you weigh the center of the sheet down, there will be several inches between the bottom of the sheet and the bottom of the hole.   This is the sort of still that would be good if you actually have to distill your drinking water. If you get stranded on a desert island, this is your best option.  Set your drinking container in the center of the hole and partially bury it to keep it from falling over. Insert one end of the plastic tubing into the container and lay the other end well outside the hole. The goal is to keep the tubing clean and secure so it doesn't fall back into the hole.  Line the hole with cactus, leaves or other living plant parts if they are available. Placing plants in the hole isn't necessary, but will help your still produce more water.  Cover the hole with a plastic sheet use rocks to weigh down the corners.  Carefully place a rock in the center of the plastic sheet so it slopes downward at an angle of about 45 degrees; the lowest point should be directly over the container in the hole, but not touching it.  Cover all edges of the plastic sheet with dirt or sand to keep water vapor from escaping. Take care not to cover the plastic tubing.  Wait two or three hours for moisture to collect on the plastic sheet and run down the sides into the container.  Drink the water through the plastic tubing. You can disassemble the still and drink directly from the container, but you will have to build the still again when you're through; in the meantime, any water vapor on the sheet will evaporate.  

gather your materials.  dig a hole.  insert your container.  add plant material.  cover your hole.  add a weight.  seal the edges.  wait for moisture to collect.  drink! 

 If suddenly there was a stranger trying to put something on your back, put leather straps around your face and head, and wanting to get onto your back and control you with a metal device put into your mouth, you would probably be kind of annoyed. Try to keep this in mind as you begin training your horse.   Remember, this is a very large animal that is scared, could be belligerent and want to hurt you just to get away from you. Your life, and those around you could be in danger. So be smart, find someone who knows what they are doing before you attempt anything close to "taming" this animal. You might just save the horse's life too.; , The decision to train a horse should be researched well before the animal is even purchased. Begin with the breeder or owner and find out the "personality" of the horse. Is it friendly and willing? Or is it a man killer in disguise?   Get a "pre-purchase" examination by a qualified equine veterinarian. Your vet specialist can help you to discover any underlying medical problems, joint conditions, dental problems that may impact training regimes. Not every horse is friendly, or going to make a good candidate for training.  All horses need to be checked out for health and vaccinated against infectious diseases and other problems unique to horses. Quick changes to nutrition can have a serious effect on the horse's stomach and could lead to serious problems, such as Colic. This is another reason it's essential that you visit a licensed and qualified equine vet before you attempt to train a horse.  Horses intended for pleasure riding, simple trail riding, long distance riding, athletic events, or high level competition like polo or barrel racing need to be trained differently. Likewise, horses being used for work such as cattle cutting need special training, as well. Match your horse with techniques that will blend well with your intended purpose, the breed of the animal, and what you expect the animal to accomplish for you.   There is a huge spectrum of training. From Dressage to Endurance to Hunting and Jumping to Track Racing, the list is more complicated than possible to get into for the purposes of this article. It's important to consult with experienced trainers where you stable your horse and develop an appropriate plan for your purposes.  Put them out in a pasture with a very patient horse. Every day, come out with a bucket of oats or treats. The patient horse should come up to you, accepting your treats. Pet the horse and make it clear that the other horse is being treated well. Eventually your horse should start coming to you for these delicious treats too. Stroke your horse, use a kind, warm, and inviting tone, and be very patient.   After a while, when your horse just starts coming, stop bringing treats. Your horse will eventually come to realize that when you come out, they should too.  Training a horse to accept a person takes patience and common sense. Horses are big animals and can hurt you if you are not paying attention and don't understand how they react to certain things. A horse is a prey animal therefore they are constantly on the lookout for danger as a result they are hyper alert and can run or rear up or kick in self defense so it is best to not make sudden moves around them or "surprise" them.   That being said it is not hard to gain a horses trust. First you will want to tether your horse with a halter and a lead rope so the horse won't walk away from you. It is always a good idea to have someone who knows about horses with you to help you manage the horse at first.  Horses are large and potentially dangerous animals, so it's important to stay aware at all times when you're handling them. Look for any potential situations that could trigger a fear response.   Always wear boots and pay attention to where the horse hooves are because you will eventually get stepped on. Whenever possible approach your horse from the front or side. Horses have wide angle vision but if you are directly behind them they cannot see you.  Hold the lead rope in one hand a gently start rubbing the horse on their neck or between their ears or on their sides. Horses will let you know whether they like it or not by moving closer or moving away from your touch.   A carrot or some grain in your hand will get their attention. When feeding a horse with your hand give them the flat of your palm not your fingers. Let the horse smell you and get to know you. Run your hands over their back and hind end.  To get comfortable with your horse, a good brushing is essential. Remember to be soft and gentle with your strokes. If you are standing directly behind the horse, they can not see you so it's important to keep talking and maintain contact with the horse with your hands and talk in soft gentle tone.   If you want to build a bond with your horse brush and stroke it daily, it will go a long way. It is a good idea to begin any ride with 10 minutes of gentle brushing and massaging your horse.  Once your horse is calm enough, start putting a halter on and start walking the horse around the pasture. Stroll along, and if your horse tries to run away, let them. Eventually, the horse will come back, as they see you mean no harm and don't pose a threat. Eventually, once your hose seems comfortable, ask them to pick up a trot, then canter, then, if you feel up to it, a gallop. Remember to take your time, and that you don't need to ask for the gallop before moving on.   To begin with, just start bringing a lead rope, but keep strolling around. If your horse seems okay with this, start strolling around other places. You can even go into an arena, so they get used to it. Remember not to wrap the lunge line, so if your horse bolts or spooks, you won't be dragged. Once your horse can properly perform a walk, trot, canter, and halt in both directions, add a saddle. Keep lunging your horse from a halt to the canter, and gradually add weights to the saddle.  Consult more experienced riders for more information about saddling and tacking your horse. Tie the lead rope so it will break away if the horse should spook and pull tightly but otherwise keep the horse tethered. Allow only enough slack in the lead rope to allow her head to move but not enough to touch the ground.   If your horse is standing too close to you or leaning on you, then push back gently. Horses respond to pressure. So firmly push the horse into position don't ever yank or yell at a horse. You will find that applying pressure will often get a better result.  Before saddling up, brush off the area where the pad and saddle will rest on your horses back, being sure no dirt or grit will rub the horse under pressure of your weight in the saddle. Place the pad gently on the horses back after first showing to her and allowing her to smell it. This is important especially if she is fairly new to the process. same with the saddle let the horse see the saddle then place it gently on her back.   Once the saddle is on, the front should rest on the blanket close to the base of the horses neck and the girth strap should hang just behind her foreleg. When tightening the girth strap gently apply pressure do not jerk the strap. Have a friend help you with tying the cinch off and putting on the bridle which takes some practice with placing the bit between the horses teeth without knocking the teeth with the bit.  Every time you come near the horses, you need to take stock of the horse physically and emotionally. Assess the condition of its hooves and legs, as well as the breathing rate. Is the horse calm, or excited and antsy?   Often there is a good reason for this and you must try to figure it out and fix the problem. Sometimes leading the horse away into a different direction and circling back is enough to get them to cooperate.  Once your horse can perform the gaits in both directions with weights in the saddle, a bit, and reins collected to where a rider's hands would be, your horse is ready to be mounted. Be extremely careful when mountain your horse at first.   Some horses don't even go forward, but will just back up endlessly while you're on. If your horse displays bad habits (bucking, kicking, rearing) after the first few minutes, try being a bit sterner. You want to make it clear that bad habits are a no. After thirty minutes, get off. Your rides will get longer with time, but you want your horse to get used to a rider.  

put yourself in the horses shoes.  learn everything you can about the horse you're training.  make sure your horse is vaccinated, and find out what it has been eating.  tailor your training method to your riding interests.  let the horse be around other tamed horses.  go slowly.  be aware of your surroundings.  let your horse get used to your touch.  learn to groom the horse properly.  start by lunging the horse.  learn to tie your horse up firmly.  saddle the horse.  learn to read your horse.  don't expect much from your first ride. 

 Do you want to use it to enhance your business? Are you looking to start a new relationship? Are you wanting to use it to make or connect with old friends.   Each objective will require you to tailor the next instructions to your specific need, but putting yourself out there is the first step to success.; ,   Log-in your information and open an account on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. Other sites you might consider later include YouTube to post your videos, Flickr to post your photographs, digg, meetup or de.licio.us. If you enjoy writing, consider a free blog on a site such as Wordpress.com as well. Blogs require time and dedication to maintain, so only commit to one if you think you can devote the time to it.    Be truthful. That is a golden rule. The objective is not to misrepresent yourself. Instead it is to make your credentials shine, to network and to build connections based on mutual respect, not lies. Be thorough. By including such details such as your high school, college and place of employment, you can access friend request tools that let you target specifically the people from your past and present. Be witty. Whether you are looking to find a mate, looking to impress co-workers or trying to stand out online, use your creative skills to make a positive impression when describing yourself.  They say that a picture says a thousand words, and this especially holds true when making online first impressions.   Ask a friend or family member to take a headshot for you. Don't hold the camera phone a foot from your face and snap your own pic. Don't hold the camera phone to the mirror and take your picture that way either. Instead, choose a good background like the woods, or a grassy area, and have someone take your headshot looking down at you. This angle will help avoid a double chin, and it gives you a subtle background that rocks your profile picture.    On Facebook, you can friend request anyone, but it is up to them whether or not to accept your friend request. Facebook also has other tools such as searching through your email accounts to send messages to your friends to network with you. You can also search by your high school or college to make additional connections. On Facebook, once you start making connections, the software will begin to recommend people that it thinks you might want to be friends with based on who has already friended you. This is a great way to build your connections. On Twitter, you can "follow" anyone's Twitter feeds that you would like. Most people will follow you back if you choose to follow their site, so following a large amount of people is the first step to getting your own followers. LinkedIn is based on existing connections, so it will only allow you to connect with people that you know. If there is someone that you would like to connect with, though, you can simply message a current contact to make the electronic introduction for you.  No one wants to know that you just ate a sandwich, but if you ate a sandwich at a popular new deli and wanted to rave about the establishment, that makes it a meaningful comment. 

determine your objective for jumping into the social media world.  open up accounts on the major social media sites.  update your profile information.  use a good profile photograph.  put yourself out there, and start friend requesting people.  post meaningful content.  follow up with people who friend request or message you, like or comment on other people's posts, and try to check your account at least once or twice per day.  

 Shelties are fast runners and if your dog ever gets loose, she might be hard to catch or even get lost. To make it easier for people to return your sheltie to you if she gets lost, make sure that she is always wearing a collar and an ID tag that provide your contact information (address and phone number).   You may also want to get your sheltie implanted with a microchip so that she will be identifiable without her collar as well.; , When you first get your sheltie, it is important to take her to see a veterinarian as soon as possible for a routine exam. Annual exams are a great way to keep your sheltie in good health. Your sheltie will also need to get medicine and vaccinations for:   Heartworm Fleas and ticks Lyme disease Rabies  , If you do not plan to breed your sheltie, then you should have your dog spayed or neutered. Spaying and neutering will prevent your dog from becoming pregnant or impregnating another dog. It may also help to protect your dog against behavior issues and certain diseases and infections.Spayed female dogs may be protected from certain types of cancer and uterine infections. Spaying and neutering also helps to prevent roaming, aggression, and other hormonal behavior problems., Although most shelties will live healthy lives with proper care, the breed is more prone to a few conditions. It is good to be aware of these conditions so that you know what measure you can take to detect or even prevent them. These conditions include:    Patent ductus arteriosus. This is a heart defect that can show up early in life. Some cases of this condition can be corrected by surgery, but others cannot be treated and the dog may need to be euthanized.  Deafness. Shelties that have a blue merle hair coat may be more likely to develop deafness. If you notice that your sheltie is not responding to you when you call, then take her to see your veterinarian.  Dermatomyositis. This is an inherited inflammatory disease that affects the skin, muscles, and blood vessels. This disease may be present in puppies as young as four months old. Your veterinarian can provide medication to control some of the symptoms, but sometimes euthanasia is the only option if the disease progresses. There is no way to screen for this disease.Hip dysplasia. With this condition, the bones that form the hip (the thigh bone and pelvis) create a shallow socket and this may lead to arthritis and lameness. If your dog has hip dysplasia, then he will probably have trouble walking. Surgery may correct this disorder, but not always.  Cryptorchism or undescended testicles. If your dog has undescended testicles, then they will need to be removed.  Lupus Erythematosus. This condition is a multi-systemic disease that affects the skin, muscles, kidneys, joints, and muscles. Your veterinarian can provide medication to help control symptoms, but there is no cure. 

place a collar with an id tag on your sheltie.  take your sheltie for regular veterinary check-ups.  spay or neuter your sheltie.  learn about breed-specific diseases. 

 Trance particularly has unique characteristics that make it differ from other electronic music. These include, but are not limited to the factors listed below:   Emotion. One of trance's main characteristics lies in the emotional factor that it places in the listener. Much of modern trance music places emphasis on a "build-up and breakdown" measure associated with progressive trance, which is good in moderation. Be aware that trance music did not start using progressive build-ups and breakdowns until about the late 90s. Prior trance would typically keep the same beat for the length of the entire song. Repetition. Trance music is usually very repetitive. This is not to be associated with a negative connotation, as repetition is one of the factors that helps to instill the emotional aspects of the genre. You should be mindful of making any repetition flow naturally. Repetition that does not flow properly will tend to "mimic a broken record", per se, making it difficult for listeners to adapt to and connect with the sound. The quarter-note bass kick. The quarter-note kick helps to retain the emotional factor that is created by repetition. Almost all trance music has a defining quarter-note bass kick that usually remains for the majority of the song. Keep in mind that the quarter-note kick does not have to be an overpowering bass note; you might choose a subdued sound. Similarly, many artists will begin with a series of ambient sounds and gradually work the listener into the main melody. Beats per minute. Most trance lies within the range of 130-150 BPM. Sometimes it may drop below 120 BPM—particularly in ambient trance—but it generally does not exceed 150 BPM, as this begins to border hardcore electronic music, which is another genre in itself. For a lot of EDM genres, 128 BPM is good, and is very good for trance music, because it is somewhat midtempo, but has an easily danceable feel. It is also good for the style of dance used in trance music, which is jumping up and down repeatedly with hands in the air.; , While copying another artist's music isn't the best idea, there is nothing wrong with listening to other artists for inspiration and ideas. Listen to a lot of trance music to determine what you like, what inspires you, and what kinds of music you would like to make.  Remember that there are several different subgenres of trance. The sound of trance has changed considerably from what it sounded like a decade ago. Be sure to get a feel for trance from the early 90s along with trance that is released today. Many great recording artists keep music from their own genre close at hand. This "reference work" will ensure that you retain the fundamentals of the genre that you wish to write a song for. Just as all great painters study their peers for inspiration, so should you.  Trance may have some universal characteristics, but its melody can vary tremendously across subgenres. Recognize the characteristics of some of these subgenres:  "Classic" trance. While this isn't a specifically defined subgenre, this refers to early trance that began in the late 80s. This subgenre has a tremendous focus on repetition, slowly changing over the course of the song. Classic trance can be said to be ported from contemporary classical music's "minimalism" developed by contemporary composers such as Steve Reich, Terry Riley, La Monte Young, and Philip Glass. Acid trance. Acid trance is mostly similar to classic trance, except that it has a much more hypnotic and "trippy" feel to it. It has a unique sound that is often achieved by playing with filters, pans, and oscillators to create a "science fiction"-esque sound. See Roland TB-303. Progressive trance. This subgenre defined the popular "build-up and breakdown" themes that are often associated with trance. By slowly building up a progression of melodies and creating a pseudo "tension", an outburst of emotional bliss results at the peak of the melody as it "releases". These releases are often done by creating a brief lull in the melody before quickly returning to the main theme. Other common techniques include pausing, using rests, rapidly speeding up the BPM, and using progressing kicks from quarter- to eighth- to sixteenth-, note kicks, and so on. The major artists in progressive trance are Tiësto, Darude, Armin van Buuren, and Paul van Dyk. Goa trance. This subgenre shares many of the characteristics of acid trance, but has a unique "organic" sound to it. Goa trance is such a complex and structured subgenre of trance that many other "sub"-subgenres originated from goa trance, itself. Psychedelic trance. Also known as psytrance, this subgenre is very similar to goa. In what goa trance creates for an organic feel, psytrance creates an electronic, futuristic feel. Psytrance tends to use more sci-fi ambient sounds together with the techniques used in acid trance. Ambient trance. This subgenre tends to use a much slower BPM and places less emphasis on the quarter-note kick. Many ambient artists do away with the quarter-note measure altogether and drop to half-note measures or other measures. Ambient trance generally uses softer sounds and maintains an "easy listening" feel, while still retaining the repetitive and emotional characteristics associated with trance. Tech-trance. Tech-trance is a fusion between techno and trance. It is very tough. It doesn't focus on a melody, at times a melody will be used in the breakdown. Usually focuses around the talent to manipulate one note and edit it to make a very industrial sounding synth. Some names to check out who specialize in tech-trance are Sander van Doorn, Abel Ramos, Bryan Kearney, Randy Katana, and Marcel Woods.  How it is sectioned and divided? What percussion was just added or removed? How did the melody change? What all is going on? What sort of ambient noises can you hear in the background?  , You'll need a high end machine that can handle making and editing sounds if you are looking to produce quality music. Here are some important specifications to consider.   Processor. Dual core processors are particularly effective in streamlining functionality and improving performance while writing trance music. Quad cores are also brutally effective, but are expensive. Additionally, some machines still don't possess the capabilities to handle the power of a quad core processor.  Hard drive space. Higher quality sounds mean larger sound files. Keep in mind that you aren't writing music using MP3 quality, which averages a bit rate of 128 to 320. You'll want the highest quality bit rates for sounds when working to develop your music. The size of your hard drive can vary significantly, depending on the sounds that you intend to use. 250GB of hard drive space is a very liberal amount.  RAM. Two gigabytes of RAM (2GB) is a fair starting measure. 1GB of RAM tends to push the limit, and anything under 1GB becomes particularly difficult to work with effectively.  Sound card. You'll need a high quality sound card. An internal M audio "Audiophile" sound card with RCA will do fine, as well as an external "fast track" USB sound card with microphone input/RCA. This is also good for recording mixes. Music producing/editing software. This will be further detailed below.  Ableton Live, Reason, and/or FL Studio are good programs that you can use to help you to make beats, breaks, and a bass line. (Or, if you own a Mac, try GarageBand or EasyBeat, or Logic Pro for more advanced composing. On Linux LMMS would be just fine and also runs in Windows) Time and dedication will show the best results.  Get a feel for the sounds you can make and for your style. Try modding the pre-programmed sounds that you like.  Oscillators, waveforms, filters, LFOs. Synths presets are a good way of getting started, but programming the sounds yourself will be far more beneficial in the long run.  While using predefined melodies and sounds is useful for beginners making trance, you are better off developing your own unique sound. There are plenty of free VSTs (virtual studio technology) out there, all of which will improve the standard of your music.   KVR Audio is a great site for downloading VSTs, and Synth1 or SuperwaveP8 are good and easy-to-program synths. If you are willing to spend a bit of money (~$90) , Nexus is THE VST you want for the best trance lead sounds. Another mentionable VST is V-Station, which is great for trance-specific production. Vanguard is another great VSTi that can be purchased. Also Sylenth , and Spectrasonics omnisphere for pros. Gladiator 2 and zebra synths are also very good. Psytrance and Goa trance bass sound can be difficult to program from scratch on a general purpose synth if you're a beginner; Alien303 is very a good start for this until you get the grasp on how to do the sounds yourself.  The M Audio MIDI board, Oxygen O2, Keystudio, or M-audio Axiom or Novation are good for beginners. You may need drivers for the desired MIDI board of your choice. You can download necessary drivers for M Audio straight from their website.  KRK, Mackie, Behringer, or Fostex will do you good. Make sure that they come with at least a 3" subwoofer—you'll need it for the kicks and bass in trance. Also, your speakers should have at least a 1" tweeter. Don't waste your money on cheap gear! Brand names do pay off.  Don't worry if it doesn't sound great at first; you will get better with practice. Try to be critical of yourself, but also spotting ways you can improve. Remember you're not at their level until you work your way up there. It takes practice.  You don't need to go right to a producer and show your work, but you might create a Facebook or Soundcloud.com music page to get your name out there. Find a way to promote yourself. Remember: If one person doesn't like you, that's just one person's opinion.  Once you feel that your productions are turning out positive, try to get one signed. It will be very difficult, but the end result will leave you truly accomplished. You may need to send out at least 100 demo submissions to labels all over the world before you get any notable recognition.  There are several aspects to consider while doing this.  Export your track from your software. Use the format of your choice (usually in lossless .FLAC). Many programs allow you to export to .MP3 as well, but be certain that you use the V0 variable bitrate preset). Note that most media players will only play 16-bit FLAC files, although you can download codecs to play 24-bit .FLAC if you insist on using it.   Upload your file, using a file sharing site of your choice. There are countless sites, but YouSendIt is particularly notable. It is not free, but it allows you to send songs directly to anyone's email address. Generate a direct .MP3 URL to your file and copy and paste it to all of your demo submissions. Include any extra background information that you wish, such as your email, your Myspace, and so on. Create a Myspace music page. You should upload only samples to your page, since there is a size limit of about 6MB. Remember to keep your sound quality above 296kbps. This way, you'll offer a good preview in good quality, which will attract more visitors. Uploading a fraction of your song is also a safety precaution to avoid users ripping your full-length music.  

understand what makes trance unique.  get some inspiration.  listen to several subgenres of trance.  analyze the music.  purchase a computer with appropriate specs.  purchase or download music-making software.  practice using the software.  learn how a synthesizer works.  get yourself some tools and instruments to make music.  purchase a midi board.  get yourself a studio monitor.  make a mixtape showcasing your talents.  publish your music.  promote yourself and get connected.  export, render, and upload your tracks. 

 This may be your living area, bedroom, or out in the middle of the desert or the woods with God's creation.; , You may bring a hard copy of the Bible, or a digital copy on your notebook, smartphone, or tablet. You can get a free copy of an older version from a number of Internet sites.  Try to see whether God is talking to you (perhaps, it may be through a still small voice in your conscience). Anything you are impressed that God is saying must agree with the Holy Spirit and the Holy Bible. The Universe and the sounds of nature are "part" of Him. God made the good and the not so good, to build character as we learn to cope with it. The Bible states that "it is better to listen than to talk." This means that it is better to be quiet, listen and agree with what God's Word - the Bible and Spirit has to say -- rather than talking to Him without listening or meditating on the Words of God.   If you don't hear God's voice, realize that "the word is near you, even in your mouth and in your heart (innermost being): that is, the word of faith (The Gospel), which we preach;" (Romans 10:8). So, quote a favorite promise of God's Word: "The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want..." (Psalm 23:1), "The Lord sets a table before me, in the presence of my enemies..." (Psalm 23:5), etc. You can read Psalm 23 here, for more remarkable verses.  See whether God responds to your questions. God talks to His creation through His word and signs, as "the one who can do infinitely more than all we can ask or imagine according to the power that is working among us." (Ephesians 3:20). Write down your prayers, if that helps you to concentrate. Write down what God is telling you as well.  It doesn't matter whether it is in your head or out loud. The more you talk to him the better you will feel in your heart. Jesus calls us His friends! Remember "God's love is perfect, and perfect love casts out all fear!"   Jesus said, "You are My friends, if you do what I command you. I no longer call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard from My Father I have made known to you." (John 15:14 and 15).  If you can't get away from your work place, business or school, that's okay. You can still try to avoid being distracted from communing -- even if for only a few moments/minutes at a time, on a break for instance.   Don't worry about anything: instead, pray about everything, always. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done, is doing and will do, for His continued blessings on you. (Philippians 4:6 NLT)  , for inspiration and spirituality. Listen to Christian music including southern Gospel singers such as David Phelps of The Gaither Vocal Band, Chris Tomlin, Hawk Nelson, the David Crowder Band, Rend Collective Experiment, Group 1 Crew, Anthem 4 Today, Abandon Kansas, Amy Grant, Audio Adrenaline, Big Daddy Weave, Britt Nicole, Building 429, Jars of Clay, Steven Curtis Chapman, Toby Mac, Jeremy Camp, Hillsong, Aaron Shust, Phil Wickham, To Tell, and Matt Redman. These are just a few of many more Christian music artists.  See whether you can hear God's Holy Spirit sending you messages through such songs., Find a good time to do it every day!  , The pastor can help answer your questions.  The pastor can help you realise whether God is talking to you in a way that you didn't realize.  

find a quiet spot where you won't be disturbed.  bring a bible and a notebook with you as well!,  sit still and listen.  read your bible.  talk to him!,  avoid distractions.  listen to traditional, spiritual, gospel or contemporary christian music, such as hymns, or even gregorian chants, byzantium chants, etc.  let god speak to you through the christian songs and music.  it can be hard to get into a habit of listening to god and reading your bible.  go to a good, bible-based church.  if you are a kid or a teen, you may consider going to sunday school (children), or the church youth group (teens). 

 For semi-formal attire, you'll need to wear a button-down shirt. The most classic and dependable look will be the white button-down shirt, but you can have a little more fun with semi-formal attire and pick a shirt with a subtle pattern or stripes if you're attending a daytime semi-formal event.It's important to clean and iron your shirt before you wear it. No matter how nice the shirt is, you won't look right if it looks worn and wrinkly. If the shirt has a subtle pattern, make sure it matches the suit and tie you're wearing. This doesn't mean it has to be the exact same color as the suit and tie, but that the colors should be in the same color family. Having a patterned shirt can also help you add a personalized look to what may feel like a formulaic outfit.; , You still have to wear a suit to a semi-formal event -- just remember to avoid the tuxedo. For daytime events, wear a light suit that is usually cream or tan, a stroller or a director's coat, or a jacket in black or dark gray wool. For nighttime events, wear a dark charcoal or a midnight blue suit. Make sure the suit slacks fit your form and aren't too loose, too tight, or wrinkled.For a more formal semi-formal event, you can wear a tuxedo-jacket, or black trousers with a satin seam. You can also consider wearing a cummerbund. A vest that matches your suit can also go nicely with your semi-formal attire. A variety of suit fabrics work for a semi-formal suit. You can wear a suit that is made of wool, gabardine, cashmere, or a wool blend. A blazer can also be acceptable for a daytime outdoor event.  You can wear a simple tie that matches your suit for a semi-formal event. The tie should be light for a light-colored suit and dark for a dark-colored suit. You can have some fun and pick a tie with stripes or a fun pattern, as long as it isn't too silly. You should wear a simple black belt with your pants, one that isn't too thick.   You can also add some flair to your outfit by wearing a red pocket pocket handkerchief or a white silk scarf. If you're accompanying a date to an event, you can add a nice touch by wearing matching accessories. For example, if she's wearing long gold earrings, you can wear a gold tie or put a gold silk handkerchief in your pocket. Cufflinks can also be a nice addition to your look.  For semi-formal attire, wear lace-up shoes, dressy loafers, or Oxfords. For night-time events, you can wear shined leather shoes. Pair your shoes with dark dress socks. If a light sock peeks out from your outfit, the effect can be ruined.You should generally stick to wearing black shoes, but dark brown shoes can also be acceptable if you're wearing a dark brown suit. It should go without saying, but you should never, ever, wear dress shoes without socks.  Remember to take a nice long shower, style your hair, and shave your face before attending a semi-formal event. If your hair is getting long, make sure you cut it before you attend the event, or you will look disheveled. Take time with your appearance before you leave the house.   Make sure your shoes are clean, your shirt is tucked in, and your collar is fixed appropriately. Some light cologne can also help add elegance to your look.  

wear the right shirt.  wear the right suit.  wear the right accessories.  wear the right shoes.  groom correctly. 

 They might have one to recommend. They may have dolls they love and dolls they wish they never bought, so they can give you great tips and warnings. They might also have one that you don't like, so that you definitely know you won't be getting that one.; , What are other people who already own the dolls suggesting? And how good of a rating do the dolls have?, In the store, you can see them in person to know for sure what they look like. Catalogs and websites are great, too., The books let you know about their personality, if that's important to you.  Try playing with their hair and playing with them in general. See which dolls you are starting to like and which dolls you know you don't want.  They have great videos on how to care for your dolls, which can influence your final decision.  For example, the short hair may look cute, but you can't do many hairstyles. Long hair is fun, but it can be tough to take care of.  List them alongside why you want them and what you would name them (if they don't have names or you don't like the ones they have).  She's only here for one year and you might miss the opportunity to get that doll if you wait too long. Do you want a doll that looks like you, just a pretty doll to add to your collection, or a doll that you can make up your own story for? If you say "yes" to any of these questions, a Truly Me doll might be the best choice. Do you want a historical doll with which you can reenact stories and past events, and make up your own?  , Consider the following questions:   Do you really want this doll? Do you have any other dolls similar to this one? Is she a Girl of the Year and will you regret not getting her? Is she probably going to be retired pretty soon? (You can figure this out by Googling when the doll was released. For example, Julie has only been out for nine years so they probably won't retire her soon, while Addy has been available since 1993, so she has a higher chance of being retired.) What are her ratings and comments on Americangirl.com?   , After eliminating one, you're down to two or three and it's up to you to repeat these steps.  

see what your friends already own.  read online reviews of the dolls.  check out a store, catalog or go to the american girl website.  read some of the doll's books, if she's a beforever (historical) character or a girl of the year.  borrow some of your friends dolls, if they have any.  check youtube.  decide whether you want a doll you can use in any particular way.  pick out the three or four american girl dolls that you want the most.  consider the following questions:  do you want the girl of the year?,  eliminate.  make the choice.

They will also check items such as if you’ve ever committed tax fraud.The program will notify you of your application status. If you are successful, you will be invited to take the Physical Qualification Test.Candidates will then be notified if they have moved on to the next step. Qualified individuals who are selected are then invited to the physical qualification test and the Pre-Employment preparation program.  The police offer a Pre-Employment Preparation Program (PEPP), which can familiarize applicants with the required exercises needed in the physical qualification test. This voluntary program can help individuals having a hard time to train correctly by giving them some insight on how to prepare for the test.PEPP is not required but recommended for applicants.Whether or not you participate in PEPP has no bearing on your final selection., If you pass the initial screening, you’ll be asked to take the Physical Qualification Test (PQT). You must pass this test before continuing along in the application process to become a police officer in New Jersey.The PQT consists of the following timed tests: a 75 yard pursuit run, push up, sit ups, and a 1.5 mile run. You are given a certain number of points based on times and numbers of each exercise you do. You must get at least 1 point on each test and a total of 20 points or more to pass.Anyone who gets 19 points or less fails.If you fail the PQT, you will be disqualified from the current police officer selection process., Every person who has moved through the PQT will take the written examination to become a police officer. The test takes up one full day and will examine knowledge you need to be a successful officer.The exam consists of several sections: a test on situational judgment, another on following policies and procedures, a form on work and school experiences, and a final part that surveys life experiences.Every person who advances to the written examination will receive a Written Exam Information Guide., After you’ve successfully completed the application screening, PQT, and written examination, state police officials will conduct a background investigation. The background check will probe various parts of your life to assess fundamental characteristics.The background checks for integrity, good moral character, reliability, responsibility, dependability and ethical judgment to do their duties as a police officer.The background check will review information including: personal data such as citizenship, voter registration, and if you have tattoos; educational and extra-curricular activity information; military service; employment history; criminal history; and financial status.You background check may include interviews of your spouse, partner, dependents, relatives, associates, and friends.You must be truthful on your application. If you are disqualified for any reason during the background check, you may not reapply to be a police officer for one year., Candidates who successfully pass the background investigation will meet with the Candidate Review Board (CRB). The CRB will interview you and discuss any issues with your background check or application.Only you may appear before the CRB.If your CRB interview is successful, you may receive an offer of appointment to the New Jersey Police Academy.  Before you attend the police academy, you must pass tests examining your mental and physical state. They help make sure that you can perform essential functions of police work and if you’re suitable for law enforcement.The physical exam may require you to submit medical records. It also tests for problems with vision and drug use.The psychological exam will include questions that help determine if you are mentally able to handle the rigors of being a police officer.If you are found unfit during the medical and psychological exam, New Jersey police officials will rescind your conditional offer to attend the Police Academy., This two-day event is required to maintain your eligibility as a candidate. It helps expose the applicant to the process at the New Jersey State Police Academy.The program will expose you to the type of classroom, physical fitness and protocol instruction you will receive at the police academy.The program is mandatory and is two consecutive days over a weekend., If you’ve successfully completed other testing and there are funded positions within the police force, you can attend the New Jersey Police Academy. This is the final part of the process of becoming a police officer in New Jersey.   The police academy is a rigorous 24 week program that can provide you a comprehensive knowledge to be a successful police officer.The New Jersey Police Academy is located in Sea Girt, New Jersey. You must be a resident of New Jersey prior to graduation and taking a job as an officer.

 Look into Alexandrine Parakeets, Indian Ringneck Parakeets, Black-tailed Parakeet or anything else available where you live. Budgerigars, or Budgies, originate from Australia so they are likely to be a cost effective choice for Australian's wanting to have a pet parakeet. Other parakeet species come from South America, Africa and parts of Asia but can be successfully kept as pets with the correct environment and equipment. (like toys); , Just as with getting other types of pets, you want to make sure you’re purchasing from a reputable breeder. Check for online reviews to get extra feedback. Ask to view the breeder's other birds and check they are kept in clean airy conditions, have plenty of space, and seem calm and well cared for.   Make sure the birds aren't overcrowded on the perches, and check to see that they are being fed clean, quality food, including fresh fruits and veggies. Also make sure that there is a cuttle bone or mineral block in the cage. These are vital to a birds diet.  Check that there is no crusting around the cere (the spectacles above the beak) and that the vent is clean. The vent refers to the spot from where the bird defecates, and a dirty vent is a sign of digestive problems.Avoid birds that seem lethargic and don’t move from the bottom of the cage.   Make sure the birds look content, vigorous, and in optimal health. You may need to visit at different times during the day, as parakeets take naps and look drowsy at times during normal waking hours.  Parakeets are sociable birds and enjoy being kept in pairs or groups. If you purchase a single bird, you need to be able to spend time with the bird every day to satisfy her need for company.If you do decide to get multiple birds, make sure only to cage parakeets together and not with other types of birds.  Even if your parakeet looks healthy, they often don’t show symptoms until they are very ill, so you should have your new parakeet looked at by a vet very shortly after getting it. The vet will likely test for psittacosis, which is a dangerous bacteria that can be passed to you and your family. The vet will should also test for internal and external parasites, yeast, Macrorhabdus fungus, and certain other kinds of bacteria.  The size of the cage should measure at least 18 x 24 x 24 inches, but purchase the largest cage you can. Prioritize the horizontal measurements because parakeets fly horizontally rather than upward., The cage should be made from stainless steel. Unfortunately, many other metals such as zinc, brass, or lead can be toxic to parakeets, and you should never use a rusted cage or one with chipping paint. Never buy a circular cage, because they do not provide enough flight space, and a parakeets' little feet could easily be injured by the tapering bars near the top of the cage. , Parakeets love to climb, so you should select a cage with horizontal bars, allowing him to grip on and shimmy upwards. The bars should be less than half an inch apart. Otherwise, there is a risk the bird will get his head stuck between them., Line the floor of the cage with paper towels or copy paper, both of which are better choices than newspaper. When this is soiled with droppings, throw it away and reline the cage with clean paper., You will need a food bowl and a water drinker. You can mount each to the bars of the cage away from the bottom, which keeps them from getting knocked over or from having the bird contaminate them with waste.If you cage multiple parakeets together, provide a separate food bowl for each, so the dominant bird cannot fight the others away from the food., The ideal choice for perches is branches of natural orchard wood. Ideally, choose a branch diameter large enough that the bird’s toes do not curl around and overlap each other. This will likely be around 3/8” in diameter. Orchard wood such as apple, plum, pear, or cherry is safe for the parakeet to peck at it, and it has a naturally abrasive action which helps keeps his nails trim.The wooden doweling perches provided with most cages are poorly designed for birds. The diameter of the doweling is too narrow for a bird to grip comfortably, and they do not wear the claws down., Parakeets have lively, inquiring minds and need plenty of mental stimulation. Put a selection of toys in the cage, so he has something to play with. Toys that parakeets particularly enjoy have mirrors, bells, or ladders to climb up and down.Toys are needed to keep the bird healthy and entertained. Boredom can lead to screaming.  This ensures that the bird has proper company. Parakeets feel safe with they have an area to retreat to, so putting the cage against a wall is a good idea (rather than the bird feelings exposed on all sides). Avoid putting the cage beside a window or door, where it might be in danger of direct sunlight or drafts because they are very sensitive to temperature.Bird cages should never be allowed in the kitchen.The fumes from some cooking oils—and even from the finish on some frying pans—are toxic to parakeets and can make the bird very ill., Changing out the paper at the bottom of the cage isn’t enough on its own. Clean the cage bars with soap and water regularly, particularly after you've clipped food to the bars.   , Though seeds are a very common diet for parakeets in the wild, they are also a source of bacterial infection and can easily lower the health and lifespan of your bird. Bacteria can build up and overwhelm your bird over time. Consider converting your parakeet’s diet to roughly 60-70% pellets. Birds adapt to pellets at various rates, and initially may reject them, perhaps vigorously. However, about 90% of parakeets will convert within two weeks using the following plan:   Give birds seed for only one hour in the morning and one hour at night. The rest of the time they have to snack on pellets. Generally, the 10% of parakeets that don't switch in two weeks will switch after a short period of reverting to a seed diet.  As well as the seeds, feed a variety of fresh fruit and vegetables such as kale, beets, peas, carrots, parsley, cooked yams, sliced apple, mandarin oranges, citrus, and the like. If you vary what you offer the bird—never give the same fresh food two days in a row—this avoids any dietary overloads that might be associated by feeding an excessive amount of one food.Try clipping pieces of apple or carrot to the bars at which your bird can peck. For larger fruits and veggies, you can also chop them up in a food processor to food in your bird’s food bowl. Most fresh foods are safe for parakeets EXCEPT for avocados, eggplants, apple pips, rhubarb, tomato plant leaves, and potato plant leaves. You should also never give your parakeet caffeine, chocolate, or alcohol., Let the bird get used to you and the surroundings, doing nothing but maintaining his food/water and cage, before trying to train the bird to perch on your finger.  Millet sprigs or "sprays" are a favorite treat, but don't feed too much of it (about 1/2" per day), as it is fattening like junk food. Avoid sweets or excess oats, both of which are fattening.   Millet sprays are also one of the best ways to train the parakeet to perch on your finger.  Parakeets need company so be prepared to spend at least ninety minutes a day—though not necessarily all at once—chatting to your bird or interacting. Parakeets can be clicker trained as well, which is a fun way of stimulating the bird mentally and encouraging her to bond with you.   Without regular and sufficient attention, parakeets will lose interest in human interaction. A pair will tend to bond with one another (regardless of sex) and ignore humans, but through interaction, you can be considered part of the flock. A way to interact with your bird is to sing together, give it baths and if it seems to be rapidly dropping a mobile toy, pick it up. There is a chance it is trying to play a game with you. Sometimes parakeets get lonely. A good way to get them happy again is to talk to them. To get them to climb up on your finger, push a little bit on their stomach, and say, "Step up." By continuously saying that, they will start to say it by themselves, and will "step up" whenever they say it,which will usually be when they come to a stair/ledge.  Although the bird can fly in the cage, it is a good idea to let the bird out once a day for free flight. Obviously, be alert for hazards and close windows and doors, extinguish candles, and that sort of thing. Again, clicker training can come in handy to test your bird a command when it’s time to return to the cage.   Many things you might not immediately consider can be dangerous to parakeets. Before allowing your bird out of the cage, remember not just to close windows, but also: put away potentially dangerous shiny objects such as knives in the kitchen, turn off all fans, keep them off the floor around children and other pets, etc. The safer you can make the environment, the better.  Parakeets will sleep approximately ten hours a day, mostly at night, but they can nap during the day as well. When your parakeet is asleep, try not to make too much noise, though music or the television at low volumes is still okay.   At night, parakeets like the security of being covered, so drape a towel or pillowcase over the cage.  Parakeets are sensitive to large swings in temperature. They do well with average household temperatures, but always make sure their cage has a shady spot where they can retreat and try not to let indoor temperatures exceed 80°F (27°C). Do not place the cage in direct sunlight.  Parakeets are a lot of work, but you will find them an affectionate and funny companion. Most will talk and how much they learn is really up to you. Be prepared to do some daily care and maintenance, as well as giving them attention and playtime, or consider getting another hobby.  

decide if you want to go classic budgerigar parakeet or choose any of the 100 odd types of parakeet.  choose a reputable breeder.  look for a bright-eyed and lively parakeet.  consider keeping parakeets in pairs.  take your new parakeet to the vet.  purchase a proper-size cage.  choose a stainless steel or some kind of non-galvanized cage.  choose a cage with horizontal bars.  line the cage for proper hygiene.  attach a food bowl and water drinker.  furnish the cage with a perch.  provide toys in the cage.  find a spot for the cage in a room where you spend a lot of time.  clean the entire cage.  provide a diet primarily of pellets.  supplement your parakeet’s diet with seed mixes, fresh fruit, and vegetables.  change the food and water daily.  offer treats.  socialize with your parakeet.  give your parakeet time out of the cage.  provide proper sleeping conditions.  keep a proper temperature.  be conscientious. 

 One of the most active ways you can demonstrate kindness and love to others is to volunteer your time to a cause or an organization. This will allow you to act on your feelings of compassion and empathy for others, and to feel you are making a direct impact on someone’s day. Volunteering your time, even once a week, will also allow you to focus your energy outwards, towards others, and to connect on a social level with others.Search online for volunteer opportunities using a database: http://www.volunteermatch.org/. You can also reach out to organizations in your community to see if they need volunteers for an upcoming event, or for a weekly event or program.; , Another way you can show kindness and love to others is to take on a teaching or mentoring role. This can be on a small scale, where you take the time to teach someone a new skill, or on a larger scale, where you share your knowledge with a group of people as a teacher in a community program or class. You may consider becoming a school teacher or offering up some time each week to act as a Big Brother or Big Sister to a child.You can also share your talents on the Internet by making videos demonstrating a particular skill or ability, making it easy to access for a wide audience. Doing this may only take a small amount of time out of your day, but it will allow you to share your knowledge with others and feel you are passing on valuable information. Often, being a mentor means building a relationship with a person over time and acting as a role model for others. Many teachers become mentors to their students, but you may also act as a mentor to someone you work with or someone you collaborate with on a project. Be open to opportunities to act as a mentor or guide and take the time to share your abilities with others.  Show you can be kind and loving by practicing active listening when engaged in conversation with someone. Active listening means listening and responding to someone in a way that improves mutual understanding. Instead of looking at conversations as competitions or battles to be won, think of conversations with others as learning opportunities. This will show you view conversations as a way to listen attentively to others and improves your ability to communicate with others.To practice active listening, focus your attention on the speaker and let the speaker finish speaking without interruption. You should then repeat what the speaker has said in your own words back to the speaker. Though you do not need to agree with what the speaker said, this will show you understand what the speaker said and are willing to discuss the speaker’s points in a healthy exchange of ideas.  Another way to demonstrate kindness and love is to speak to others with compassion and with respect. This applies to when you are talking to someone you know well, such as a parent, a teacher, or a mentor, as well as when you are talking to a stranger or an acquaintance. Focus on responding respectfully to a question, when asked, and expressing your thoughts and ideas with open language. Avoid blaming, shaming, or insulting someone when speaking to them.   A big part of speaking to someone with kindness and compassion is also focusing on the positive, rather than the negatives, of a situation. Though it is important to be honest and forthcoming about your feelings and emotions, be willing to also talk about the upsides of a seemingly negative situation or ways that you can solve or fix a problem in your life. Speaking with positivity will make others around you feel positive and energized.  Though it may be tempting to be selfish or insular, you often grow more kind and loving when you act selflessly and welcoming towards others. Part of doing this is showing your gratitude for the things people do or say to you. Chances are you have been on the receiving end of someone else’s kindness at least once in your life and have benefited from someone else’s compassion towards you.Acknowledge this kindness and compassion by saying “Thank you,” and “Please,” and by telling someone: “I appreciate what you do.” This will show you are being caring and loving to someone who is being caring and loving to you. It can also be useful to take some time in your day to express two moments of gratitude to two people who have acted as a teacher, mentor, or support for you. It could about something very small someone does for you, or something very large. Acknowledging it will make you feel positive about your day and be more willing to act compassionate towards others.  This could be something as small as offering to babysit for a neighbor so they can have a night out or bringing chicken noodle soup to a sick friend. Even small acts of goodwill can go a long way to impacting others in a kind and loving manner.   As well, you should try to demonstrate acts of kindness for strangers or acquaintances whenever you can. Though you may not want to give your spare change to someone on the street, offering them a cup of coffee, some food, or even taking time out of your day to exchange a few friendly words with them can have a big impact and show how loving and kind you can be towards others.  

volunteer.  be a teacher and a mentor.  be an active listener.  speak with kindness and compassion.  express your gratitude towards others.  perform acts of kindness for the people in your life. 

 The most basic diaper cream recipe contains only the three main ingredients:1/8 cup beeswax 2/3 cup coconut oil ¾ tablespoon zinc oxide powder  , This can be done in the microwave by putting the ingredients into a microwave-safe container and cooking on low in 30-second increments, stirring after each 30 second increment is up.   You can also use a double boiler on the stovetop by placing the ingredients in the top section and an inch or two of water in the bottom section. Let the water simmer at a low temperature, while stirring the ingredients together.  Remove the coconut and beeswax mixture from the heat and mix zinc oxide powder into the mixture. Use a hand mixer or stick blender and blend for several minutes until the mixture doesn’t have any clumps.  Small glass jars or metal tins work well for storing your diaper cream.   The cream will solidify as it cools, so let it cool for a few hours before using it on your baby.  

gather three simple ingredients.  melt the coconut oil and beeswax together.  add the zinc oxide.  pour the mixture into a container and it let cool. 

 Once it has been downloaded, open the .EXE file; , Depending on your computer type, these instructions for installation may vary so read closely.  You'll see there is a set of three axes provided immediately, so you get the 3D feel at the outset. Have a look at the tools available. There is a Line tool, a Circle tool and a Polygon tool. Each of these presents you with various possible options to create your desired shapes.  The first groups of tools are the orbit, pan, and zoom tools. These are used for you to move around and get different views of your subject and are briefly explained in this overview article. To move the whole viewing screen, push the centre mouse button and hold down the Shift key on your keyboard. To delete, click the arrow button on the toolbar; when something is selected to delete it will turn blue. Hit the delete key on your keyboard. To save something, click on "file" (in the upper left corner) then click on "Save As". Choose where to save the file. Type the name of your file and click on Save. The file will be saved as a .SKP file  , The line tool is selected by default when you first open SketchUp. Obviously, this is for drawing lines. Give it a try to see what you can create and just to get a feel for the lines but be aware they're one-dimensional so you won't be able to snap to axes, etc.   See How to be precise when using SketchUp.  Beyond lines, you can draw two-dimensional shapes using the tools for shapes. Draw some rectangles, circles and polygons just to try them out. All you need to do is to click on the corresponding tool.   Given that you're working with a 3D program, you'll find the 2D figure is horizontal. In addition, if there is an underlying surface, the 2D shape will be snapped to it. See How to make a sphere in SketchUp, How to make a half sphere in SketchUp and How to make a cube on SketchUp.  The way that you do this is by "pushing" or "pulling" a 2D shape into a 3D shape. Use the Push/Pull tool over the 2D shapes you've created and start seeing what happens.   Select the Push/Pull tool: Press the mouse button on the shape you want to push or pull into three-dimensional form. Click then push or pull the shape as desired. Click again. Enlarge the object as much as wanted. Add more structure. Play around with adding holes, windows or other elements by cutting out shapes within the 3D shape.  The need to see the created objects from different perspectives is an important part of any 3D program and SketchUp allows for this. The pan tool lets you move the drawing left or right and up or down. It also allows you to do a combination of these actions. The orbit tool allows you to orbit around the object you've created. This changing perspective can let you see the entire object from any angle.   Use the centre scroll button on your mouse to orbit around your image. You can also orbit by clicking the 'Orbit' button on the top toolbar (it has two red arrows on it).  This is self-evident but is clearly useful as it lets you change the position of any objects you've created. Have a try using the Move and Rotate tools to see if you can move the objects around to a different position.   see How to use the rotate tool in SketchUp and How to flip an object using SketchUp for more details.  When a shape has been completed it will turn a different colour, usually a grey-blue. Shapes must be completed to colour them in. Using the Paint tool, the objects can be painted in solid colours or in textures. With the textures, SketchUp will align the textures to the surfaces for you, making it a fun and useful experience.   To add colour, click on the paint bucket. Choose one of the categories such as Ground Cover or Named-Colours. Select a colour/texture and then click the area of the shape that you would like to shade in. To make windows, go to Translucent. Use the eraser to take away any unwanted edges. See How to add custom textures to SketchUp for more details.  This tool lets you zoom in and out on the shapes you're creating. Use the Zoom tool to show more detail. If you have a mouse wheel, you'll discover that scrolling one way will zoom in and scrolling the other will zoom out.  There are dozens of these available to you and if there is one to suit your needs, it'll stop you from having to reinvent it. The 3D warehouse offers objects in the areas of architecture, landscape, construction, people, a playground, and transportation. It's a good idea to look through the component library to see if it has objects you'd like to play around with.  SketchUp enables you to position construction guides anywhere within a drawing. Once there, they can be used to align the object. These are the dotted lines and they make it easier to line up objects.  The more advanced tools in SketchUp are the resizing tool, the uniform tool, the curve tool, the follow me tool, the text tool, the angle tool, and the measuring tape tool.    The resizing tool: This is used by selecting an object, and dragging the little boxes on the corners and faces to make it any size you want, including wide, tall, short or squat.  The follow-me tool: This allows you to move an object along a specified path, thereby creating a new object. To learn more, see the articles in the Follow-Me tool category.  The uniform tool: If clicked on a face, this will make another face just like the one you click. You can make the face smaller or bigger, depending on how far you drag the cursor.  The curve tool: This is used just like the line tool except if you create a line and drag it to the side, it will create a curved line.  The text tool: This will allow you to add text to your model by putting it on a face.  The angle tool will allow you to rotate an object by clicking on a face and pivoting your cursor.  The measuring tape tool: This can be used to measure an object, and create even sections by typing it in the measurement box on the bottom right side of your screen.  wikiHow has many tutorials to help you create buildings, structures and more; here are just some examples for you to try:   How to create a living space in SketchUp How to design a doghouse in SketchUp How to make a polygon building using SketchUp How to create a uniform sloped roof in SketchUp  How to make a test structure in SketchUp.  

begin by downloading a free copy of the software.  follow the instructions.  open the program.  get to know a few basics to help you navigate around the program:  the first thing you have to know about sketchup is that it has 10 simple tools that are all useful for making a model.  draw some lines.  draw some shapes.  move to creating three-dimensional objects.  learn to use panning and orbiting.  move and rotate objects.  colour or paint the object.  learn the zooming ability.  check out the pre-built models in sketchup.  learn to use construction guides.  learn about the more advanced tools on sketchup once you're comfortable with the standard tools outlined above.  try building something in sketchup. 

 With everyone everywhere on a smart phone, tablet, or laptop, technology is fast becoming one of the primary ways humans communicate. Social media networks, online forums, and dating websites and chat-rooms are common stomping grounds for creeps who won't take no for an answer. Perhaps you were previously friendly with another user and he said or did something that made you uncomfortable. You have a right to tell him to back off.   In the clearest way possible, tell him that you are no longer interested in chatting or maintaining contact. Request that the person stop contacting you. Your request might be as straightforward as "Can you please stop contacting me?"; , Removing this guy as a friend or follower should prevent him from being able to contact you any further.   Sit down and go through each network in which you have had contact with him and block him from being able to view your profile and reach out to you. There are two easy ways to block contact on Facebook. You can visit the person's profile and select Block from the "..." menu. You can also click the padlock symbol on your on profile. The prompt "How do I stop someone from bothering me?" should appear. Select this, and then enter the name or email address of the user you want to block., If you need help blocking an unfriendly user, you can always ask for assistance from the administrators of whatever site you're using. Typically, these customer service agents will make haste of blocking this person and the person will not be able to contact you again.  If you gave out your email address, or if it was listed on your user accounts, it might be a good idea to change it. If the person has not been contacting you via email, you may be okay to keep using your current one.  If a person online is stalking you, it's important to gather any inappropriate messages, emails, photos, or other means of contact to show to someone in authority. If you are not sure if your case counts as cyberstalking, consider the following. Cyberstalking occurs when someone:Monitors your computer or internet use or social media posts Posts inappropriate pictures or spreads rumors about you online Threatens to hurt you or someone you care about Messages, texts, or contacts you when you do not want him to Sends you viruses or content that potentially damaging to you computer or phone  , If blocking this person or getting help from a chat-room or social media website administrator doesn't solve the problem, you need to get legal assistance. Contact the cops and bring them up to date on the situation, being sure to provide them with evidence to help your case.  

explain that you are not interested.  block contact.if you have clearly and firmly asked the person to stop contacting you, and he continues anyway, the next step is to block this person from your social media profiles or chat-rooms.  contact the website administrators.  change your email address.  get evidence of cyberstalking behavior.  involve the police.

 Start with clean, damp hair. Use a towel to dry away any excess moisture, but do not wait for the hair to dry completely.   The hair will be easier to shape when damp, but too much moisture can make it too heavy. Towel dry it until it is no longer dripping wet, but still visibly moist. This style is easiest to create on fairly short hair of nearly any thickness. Ideally, the nape and sides should be very short, but the top section and crown should be between 2 and 3 inches (5 and 7.6 cm) long. Note that the hair should also be fairly straight, but the style can be done on wavy hair, as well.  Squeeze a nickel-sized dab of sculpting paste or pomade into your palm, then spread it across both hands. Massage the paste throughout the entire head of hair.   Use your fingers to evenly comb the paste through the hair. Try to cover the hair from root to tip all the way around the head. The best product to use will depend upon the coarseness of the hair. Determine whether the boy has thick or fine hair, and choose a product formulated for use with that type of coarseness. Light pomades tend to work best for thick hair, but heavy waxes might be necessary for fine hair.  Attach a diffuser to a standard hair dryer and dry the hair, brushing it upward as you work. Continue until the hair is mostly dry.   To help create the spikes, grab the hair at its root in small sections and pull straight up. Focus the hair dryer on this section of hair as you manipulate it. Continue until the hair is still slightly moist to the touch, but no longer visibly damp.  Once the hair is mostly dry, turn off the hair dryer and use your fingers to tweak the spikes as desired.   The simplest option is to quickly run your fingers through the hair, pushing it upward and in a single direction. Alternatively, you can create a messier look by pulling the hair upward and in different directions over the top of the head.  Allow the hair to finish drying by air. If necessary, you can hold the spikes in place with a light mist of hairspray.   This step completes the process.  

towel dry wet hair.  apply sculpting paste.  use a diffuser.  adjust the spikes.  let it dry naturally.

 Especially if she’s fond of her family (or yours!) you can make your proposal a group affair with her favorite people. You could have her aunts and uncles wear shirts that spell out “Will you” and younger cousins in shirts that spell out “marry me?” You might even have the family hold up a “Will you marry me?” sign, while you kneel before it, extending her your ring.   Another way you could involve her family is by proposing at a family party or event, like a family Christmas party. Hide your ring inside a present, and be sure to be by her side when she opens it. When she realizes what it is, you can ask her the question you’ve been waiting for. Family games, like a scavenger hunt, can also turn into memorable proposal opportunities. Bring the game planner in on your scheme, and have a special set of proposal clues made for your girlfriend. Await her arrival at the end of the hunt with your engagement ring in hand and someone nearby to snap a couple candid photos. You might turn a family game of charades, sometimes called gestures, into your proposal. Orchestrate it so that you and your partner are on the same team. Then, when it’s your turn to go, get her to ask the question, “Will you marry me?” in gestures. When she finally gets the answer, drop to your knee and hold out the ring.; , This will require some time, effort, and potentially some dancing skills on your part. But a marriage proposal through the coordinated song and dance of a group of people will make yours impossible to forget.

You might choose a mundane, everyday location where it’s sure to surprise, like a supermarket, train station, or a downtown area. You could even waylay her with your flash mob proposal on your way to a special dinner date! If you’re not as confident in your ability to perform in public, you might want to put together a digital flash mob proposal. This has the added benefit of limiting outside interruptions and other potential mistakes that could occur during a live flash mob performance. Have a friend or a professional record your flash mob at a private location, add music, and then use it to propose. The budget for your flash mob can be expensive. To keep things affordable, you may want to forego hiring a photographer and instead hire a videographer. This way, all your hard work, your cool choreographed moves, and the lovely message of matrimony at the end can be watched over and over again., While it might be impossible to get her favorite actor to show up and help you seal the deal, you might be able to get a written message from a celebrity that you can use with your proposal. You should check and see if there are any signings or meet-and-greet opportunities you can take advantage of. At these events, you’ll likely get a chance to explain your proposal plans and get a handwritten message from her favorite star.   Authors are well known for signing special messages to fans in their books. If your beloved possible bride has an author she’s particularly keen on, you could look up book signing dates or tour dates for that author. Come prepared with a book for the author to sign, and then at the signing, request the author to modify the message for your purposes. You might ask them to write, “To <Bride’s Name>, soon to be married to a lucky guy!” or something to that effect. Depending on the message written, you might frame it in glass along with a picture of the two of you together. This would be a perfect surprise gift to lead into your proposal. Then, when she sees the message from her idol, have the engagement ring ready so you can pop the big question., Unless you’re a one-man-band, you might want some backup when it comes to your wedding proposal serenade. You can choose a romantic song that will sweep her off her feet, or you can write a song of your own. There are many ways you can approach this. You could take center stage yourself and sing karaoke style, or you could allow a performer to sing for you while you prepare to bend knee and propose.   Many couples have a romantic song that is special to both. If you have a romantic song, or if you know your girlfriend's favorite romantic song, you can use this in your serenade. Whether you blast it from a sound system of a restaurant or sing along to it while it plays on your phone speakers at an intimate locale, she’ll surely appreciate your thoughtfulness when you finish the song by asking for her hand in marriage. Many popular songs have arrangements for various musical instruments. If you play an instrument, you might accompany the serenade as part of your proposal. Music arranged for your instrument can likely be found at your local music store, or online through a music retailer.

 Part of standing up for what you believe in is learning to be courageous. Courage doesn't mean you're not afraid. Many courageous people are afraid, but they act anyway because they know it's important. If you really believe in your cause, you need to act on it despite your fear.Part of being courageous is picking a side. It's hard to act in the moment if you don't know what you stand for. For instance, if you don't know whether you're for or against an issue, such as spending taxpayer money on animal welfare, you may find yourself not wanting to speak up in conversation because you're on the fence. However, if you know where you stand, you'll be more inclined to speak about it. Other people may disagree with you, so be prepared to stand your ground no matter what others think. Don't be afraid to ask for help. Sometimes, you'll lean on others to find your courage, and that's okay. The more people you have behind you, the braver you'll feel. Focus on who you'll be helping. Often, when you're standing up for what you believe in, you're doing so to help others. Focusing on how they will benefit can help you feel more courageous.; , If you're like most people, you likely commit small acts of bravery throughout your day without even realizing it, especially if you are a bit reserved. For instance, maybe you've been dreading a phone call you need to make, and you finally pluck up the courage and do it. Take a moment to acknowledge that you've shown a small act of courage. These small acts can inspire you to be braver in other areas, such as when you need to stand up for a belief., Putting your beliefs into action often means standing up for others who can't stand up for themselves. Sometimes people are unwilling or unable to speak up for themselves, and you need to step in. If you are going to say you believe in compassion, for instance, you must put it into practice when you see people in trouble.   For instance, you may need to step in when you see someone being bullied. Try to stop the bullying in its tracks by interrupting what the person is saying or by trying to separate the bully from the victim. If you're a kid, don't be afraid to ask an adult to help. Also, make sure the person is okay, mentally and physically. Get the person help if they need it., Conviction is a feeling of certainty in your beliefs.Knowing that you're on the right side of an issue makes it easier to stand up in the face of opposition. Challenges will come, but you can withstand them if you are firm in your belief.  Standing up for someone may make you a target. If you stop a bully, the bully may turn their attention to you. When people challenge your belief, they are testing it. If you back down, then they will see it as a weakness in your position.  Part of putting your beliefs into action is speaking when you see something that goes against your core values. Now is the time you start standing up, when something is going on near you that you have the power to change. Take a deep breath, and speak up.Suppose you are out with some male friends and one of them makes a derogatory comment about an attractive woman nearby. You can ignore it or choose to take a stand. Ask your friend, “Is that how you try to get dates?” or “How would you like if I talked to your sister like that?” By not ignoring behavior you find troubling, you can help spark conversation and possibly accelerate change. Remember that silence is its own position. When you are silent, you give your approval for what's happening. When there is a conflict around you, if you stay silent, people will think you agree with the status quo., When you speak up, how you say things matters. That is, if you get angry, other people tend to just hear the anger, not what you're saying. Plus, you're giving others permission to get angry, too. If you stay calm, you may be able to actually convince people to hear what you're saying, instead of just tuning you out.  If you're going to stand up for what you believe in, you may need to make some sacrifices at times. You may lose some "coolness" points because people don't think the same way you do. You may even lose some friends or acquaintances. That doesn't mean you should beat people over the head with your values. Rather, sometimes when you stand up for a value, acquaintances may decide they don't share the same values.It can be hard, but putting your beliefs first will help you become a moral person.   If you go against your beliefs, eventually your self-worth will suffer because you aren't being true to yourself. You'll have higher self-esteem if you live according to your own values.Don't let situations compromise your values. For instance, if you are in a job that asks you to do things that go against your personal values, you may need to find a new job.  When it comes to standing up for your beliefs with friends and family members, you may find it harder to do. You value those relationships, and so you may not want to disagree with the people you care about. However, you can still disagree in a calm and reasonable manner without it blowing up into a huge argument.First of all, it's fine to state your beliefs. You have a right to believe what you want to believe, even if it conflicts with what people near you believe. When you do state what you believe, make sure you do so calmly and have facts to back up what you say. That way, you can answer questions. In addition, try not to go into the discussion with the mindset of "winning." It should be a conversation, with both of you giving and taking. When discussing your beliefs, your goal should be to have your voice heard rather than to "win" an argument or change the other person's beliefs or actions. If the person is willing to discuss it with you, particularly if the person is on the fence, present your case for your side in a clear, logical way. Also, be willing to listen to what the other person has to say. That means actually hearing their side and concerns, not just preparing a counterargument. As you discuss, make it a point to try to find things that you both agree on. Often, you'll find common ground somewhere. If the discussion gets heated, decide if you want to get in a fight over it. You've stated what you believe, so getting in an argument will likely not resolve anything or change the person's mind. You may just want to back out of the discussion by saying, "Let's agree to disagree." You don't have to permanently damage a relationship just because you disagree with someone. On the other hand, if you disagree with someone on many core values, you may find you want to spend less time with them.  

learn to act even when you're afraid.  encourage your acts of bravery.  stand up for others who are unable to.  have conviction in your beliefs.  say something when you see behavior that bothers you.  be calm and non-confrontational while speaking up.  put your values and beliefs first.  discuss issues with friends and family members.

Television tells you what to think and how to think it, basically putting your brain on autopilot. That's why it's so relaxing! If you want to keep your brain from stagnating, the first thing you have to do is turn off the TV. If you really want to watch, use your brain while you watch. Choose to watch educational programs and if you watch popular programs, choose ones with complex plot lines or character interactions. Think about these while you watch and try to analyze them or guess what happens next.  Simple puzzles like crosswords can help your brain do some basic work. These are easy to fit into your day. You can even find some for free online.  Large, complex puzzles give your brain a stronger workout. These can sometimes take several days to a week to finish but they're worth the effort.

Over 100,000 years, the human brain has evolved to tune itself through both making and using tools. By doing things that are similar to using tools, you help to fine tune your brain and keep it humming along nicely. For example, playing the violin or doing the Rubik's cube have things in common with making and using tools. All require the use of gross motor skills, fine motor skills and sequences to operation and identification of things. Therefore, doing such activities daily or twice a day, should help to keep your brain in great shape., Talk with people about things you or they know about. Talking about politics, religion, and other challenging topics (having real discussions, not just arguments), can be a great basic brain workout.  Join a group or club for people with the same interests as you. This can be a hobby club, a political group, a discussion group, or anything like that.

If you just don't have the money or time, there are also a number of free classes available online. Some are even from top universities, like Harvard. Try Coursera, Khan Academy, or even just Ted Talks to get the university experience, without the price.  With your brain, much like your muscles, it's kind of a "use it or lose it" situation.

Learn exercises or how to play new games to increase your hand-eye and body coordination. Tai-chi and pinball are both examples of this.  Scientists are actually discovering that sleep plays an absolutely vital role in keeping your brain healthy. While you sleep, your body cleans toxins out of your brain (in addition to making repairs). If you want to protect your brain, make sure you get a full night's sleep as regularly as possible.  Try commuting with varied routes, to prevent the brain from feeling too neglected as the result of a monotonous day. You can also change how you work, by introducing an exercise ball or other factor into how you work.

 Rather than repressing, ignoring, or masking your emotions, embrace them as a way to understand how you really feel. Our emotions help us to understand the challenges we're facing, and provide possible guides to what we need to change in our lives. Emotions can help you to figure out what is really bothering you.One way to embrace your emotions by learning to identify them, such as by picking up your own physical cues. When you have identified the emotion, process what you are feeling  and thinking, either by writing about it or discussing it with a trusted friend. Know that there are no unhealthy emotions. Instead, it is what we do with those emotions and how we cope with them that matters For example, let's say that you just became tearful after a really big fight with your friend. You may be worried about your friend, your friendship, or your future. While you may not want to be crying, your feelings of sadness can guide you to figure out what really matters.  Remind yourself that you can overcome life's challenges. Look back at small successes to remind you of what you can do, rather than dwelling on the negative. Avoid letting your emotions get the best of you. Pay attention to how you're feeling rather than ignoring it, and focus on small steps to feeling better.Use words of self-affirmation. Believe that you can overcome anxiety, fear, and hurt. Say them to yourself. Consider saying things like, "I am confident about solving life's problems successfully." or "With every breath, I release the anxiety within me, and I become more and more calm."Remind yourself of your past successes rather than your past failures. Close your eyes and remember those moments of success amid adversity. Those feelings of triumph are that much sweeter. If you are struggling to think of your successes or good qualities, call a close friend and ask them to help you. Say something like, "I'm feeling really down and struggling with valuing myself. Can you help remind me of some of my strengths?" This may help restore your confidence.  If your emotions of fear, anxiety, anger, or sadness linger and last for days or weeks, you may have created an unhealthy emotional boundary. You may feel stuck in your emotions, and unable to take the next step of action. Avoid feeling out-of-control in your emotions by setting up boundaries such as:Having a multi-faceted life. For example, you're more than just an athlete, a parent, or a hard-working professional. This way your identity is more than just one thing. Being okay with second (or third) best. You won't be heartbroken and angry every time that you don't get the top pick. Life isn't just a cutthroat competition. Accepting that you can't force others to change. You may want to protect and support your friends, family, partners, or kids even when they make harmful decisions that impact themselves and others. Be willing to say no at times can be healthy. Not taking on the emotions of others. While it may be hard to see your best friend in pain and crying, you do not have to take on her pain, too. You can be supportive and helpful while maintaining your emotional boundaries. Let others have thoughts and feelings independent of you.  

embrace your emotions.  be resilient.  have strong emotional boundaries. 

 Your horse’s head can act as an indicator of his emotional state. When his head rises, he is tensing up and preparing for flight. A lowered head is a sign that he is relaxed and calm. You can teach your horse the drop-head response so he can learn to calm down on his own. This will ensure you have a smooth ride together and can rely on the cue in the event there is a tense or stressful situation during the ride., Practicing this technique on the ground first will allow your horse to get comfortable with the cue. Start by putting your horse in a rope halter with a training lead.Put your thumb and index finger on the knot just below your horse’s chin and apply steady, gentle pressure in a downward motion. Do not pull his head down. Instead apply pressure so he is aware of the cue. Observe your horse. When he drops his head, release the pressure and praise him. Then, repeat the cue again. Be patient and move slowly, as getting him to drop his head a few inches during the initial practice can be challenging. Over time, he will start to drop his head whenever you apply downward pressure. Encourage him to keep his head down towards the ground for a few minutes before rewarding him.  Once your horse seems comfortable with doing the cue on the ground, you can move to practicing the cue in the saddle.   Tack him up and mount him. Then, have the horse stand still. Shorten one rein in your hand and lift the rein slightly to apply light pressure to your horse’s mouth. Wait a few seconds and do not increase the pressure so it is uncomfortable for him. You just want enough pressure for him to notice the cue.Observe him, as he may move his head a little to figure out the cue. Once he drops his head, release the reins and praise him.  Practice the drop head cue on a frequent basis, perhaps during every ride, to get him used to the cue. You should also encourage your horse to do the drop head cue in any stressful situation during a ride. This will allow him to self medicate during the ride and react to a fearful moment in a calm manner. 

be aware of the function of the drop head cue.  practice the drop head cue on the ground first.  move to doing the drop head cue in the saddle.  encourage your horse to do the drop head cue on his own.

 This mission will introduce you to the basics of using your iDroid as well as to using the Fulton Recovery System. The latter is important because it will make extracting personnel easier and more efficient., Immediately take on a mission once you finish Episode 2. Go to the mission lists on your iDroid and choose to take the first mission or side op that you fancy. If you’d rather get familiar with Afghanistan and the controls even more, then you might also want to free-roam.  Bases and outposts that have 4 or more soldiers will usually have specialists and prisoners. Once you’re on a mission, side op, or just free-roaming, always make sure to interrogate soldiers by pressing on the LB (XBox One/XBox 360) or L1 (PS4/PS3) when holding them up with your weapon or choking them. You should then see the location of specialists or prisoners on your iDroid’s map.  Proceed to the location of the specialists and/or prisoners and use the Fulton Recovery System on them. Some specialists and prisoners will have high stats/ratings, allowing the Mother Base unit you designate them in to level up faster., Your Mother Base will start out with only a Command Platform and R&D, Support, and Base Development units. By completing the main story missions, you will get to unlock units and platforms that will not only allow you to add more people to your Mother Base, but also aid you in the development of weapons, items, and equipment., Manually check available platforms by opening up your iDroid and navigating to Base Facilities under the Mother Base tab. You should now see which platforms are available, how much they cost, and the time it takes to complete their construction.   Miller will inform you of the creation of a unit and its respective platform’s availability at the end of a mission.  Ideally, you should have enough GMP from finishing missions and side ops to construct a platform once it’s available. If for some reason you lack GMP, then you should try to replay some of the main missions that you’ve already done or search for diamonds in enemy bases and outposts when in free-roam.   Getting an S-Rank in a mission while completing all of its objectives will give you lots of GMP. You can also get GMP in free-roam by interrogating soldiers for the location of an outpost’s diamonds and other resources.  Now that you have platforms for your units, you can then proceed to the oftentimes grueling task of managing them. Open up your iDroid and look for “Staff Management” under the Mother Base tab.  To manage the personnel for these units, navigate to their respective tabs under Staff Management by using RB and LB (XBox One/XBox 360) or R1 and L1 (PS4/PS3).  You can then press on the RB (XBox One/XBox 360) or R2 (PS4/PS3) button to sort the existing personnel under the unit you want to manage. This allows you to sort personnel based on their compatibility with their existing units.  If one of your personnel has higher stats/ratings for units other than the one he/she is currently in, then you’ll need to transfer him/her there. To do so, press on the Change Assignment (A for Xbox One/Xbox 360 or X for PS4/PS3) button when the personnel’s name is highlighted and choose “Move” among the options that pop-up on your screen to transfer him/her to a unit where he/she has better compatibility., The Staff Management menu also gives you the option to dismiss personnel who have the Troublemaker special skill as well those with low (E) ratings/stats. To deal with these personnel, highlight his/her name and press on the Change Assignment (A for Xbox One/Xbox 360 or X for PS4/PS3) button on your controller to bring up the option to dismiss him/her.   A Troublemaker will cause problems in the their respective units and should be dealt with lest you end up with personnel developing PTSD and getting sent to your Mother Base’s Sickbay. Don’t worry about dismissing a Troublemaker even if he has a high rating. As you progress through the game and upgrade your Fulton and Int-Scope, you will find it easier to come across soldiers who have higher ratings.  Move compatible personnel with C or higher ratings/stats to the R&D, Intel, and Support units. Once these units level up, navigate to the Mother Base tab on your iDroid and upgrade your Fulton and Int-Scope by going to the Weapons/Items option found under “Development.”   Upgraded versions of the Fulton will allow you to extract vehicles, children, as well as increase the amount you can carry with you when you’re at any of the mission areas. An upgraded Int-Scope will allow players to analyze and determine an enemy soldier’s ratings. Aside from the Analyzer function, it will also have a directional Microphone function allowing the player to easily pick up on enemy conversations while doing reconnaissance without having to be close to a base or outpost.  Once you’ve upgraded your Int-Scope and Fulton, you can proceed to extract more personnel to add to Mother Base. Coupled with the upgraded Fulton, an upgraded Int-Scope’s analyzer function will make it easier for you to identify and extract more specialists and high-level soldiers without having to resort to interrogations.   You don’t need to be in Mother Base to manage Mother Base. You can manage your staff as well as construct platforms anywhere and anytime in-game (excluding during cutscenes) using your iDroid.  

finish episode 2.  take on missions, side ops, and free roam.  interrogate soldiers.  fulton extract soldiers and prisoners.  finish the main story missions.  check a platform’s availability on your idroid.  construct a platform once its available.  check mother base on your idroid.  access staff management.  browse and sort personnel.  move personnel to other units.  deal with troublemakers.  upgrade your fulton and int-scope.  go back to extracting additional personnel. 

 Catch your cat in a good mood, or a sleepy mood. Wait until your cat is holding still, and take his or her measurements. If your cat is hyper, play with him for a while and gradually calm him down. For example, let your cat chase a toy for a while, then let him catch the toy.   Feeding your cat might calm him down. If your cat will not hold still, try pinching the scruff of his neck with a binder clip.This will not hurt your cat, and it is likely to calm him. Different strategies work for different cats. Do whatever your cat needs to calm down.; , Take a measuring tape. Measure from the base of your cat's neck to the base of your cat's tail. Record the number. If you have no measuring tape, procure a string and a ruler. Measure with the string, then lie the string along the ruler and record its measure.  Do this while your cat is lying quietly at full length. Start the measuring tape in the middle of your cat's back. Slide it under your cat, then wrap it around the largest part of the cat's belly. If you are making an outfit with a harness, wrap the tape measure firmly, but without squeezing. If you are making clothes that cover the belly, leave a little room so your cat doesn't feel squished.  Depending on the design of the outfit, you might want to measure the length of the legs or the circumference of the head. Measure your cat's legs while he stands. Try to avoid dressing your cat in anything that will squeeze his neck or obstruct his hearing or vision. Turtlenecks are not recommended.   If your cat wears a collar, measure the collar instead of your cat's neck. Cats generally are distressed when their ears are covered, so reconsider the hat., Buy pet clothing from an independent designer or a trustworthy pet accessory retailer. Opt for outfits that have been cat-tested and cat-approved. Avoid outfits with small or dangling pieces. The outfit's description should include measurements: make sure they match the measurements you took, and opt for a looser fit over a snugger one.Buy an outfit made for a large doll only if it will accommodate your cat's neck and limbs without squeezing.  Cut out your cat's outfit from a pattern designed specifically for cats. Check the pattern against your measurements. If it is too small, discard it. Add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to every measurement to avoid creating a snug outfit that will rub your cat's hair uncomfortably.Pick a soft cloth that does not smell strongly. If you can, let your cat play with it before you sew it. If the cloth smells familiar, your cat will be less disturbed by it. If you cannot find a good pet costume, you can try adapting an outfit designed for a large doll.  Try the outfit on your cat to see if your cat will tolerate it. Make sure the costume does not obstruct your cat's vision, hearing, or movement. Clothing that covers the ears, falls in the eyes, or blocks the legs will cause your cat a lot of stress. Do not tie anything around your cat's neck, as this can choke it.   Remove any small or dangling parts of the outfit, as your cat may chew and swallow them. 

measure a calm cat.  measure your cat's length.  measure your cat's width.  measure any other relevant areas.  buy an outfit.  sew an outfit.  try it on for safety.

 Before rolling hair, apply a generous amount of mousse, about the size of a ping pong ball, to your hair or the hair of the person you’re styling. This will make hair easier to shape and style. If you skip this step, the hair will be more likely to fall out of the roll.      ; , Use a comb to part the hair down the middle. Then part the hair from ear to ear, so that you have two sections of hair framing the face, and one section of hair in the back. Put the back section of hair into a bun or ponytail to keep if from mixing with the front sections.  Use hairspray to spray the two front portions of hair. Then take one of the front sections of hair, hold it straight up, and tease it by backcombing through your hair from tips to roots. This gives the hair the volume needed to rock this hairstyle.  Take one of the two free sections of hair and pull it straight out to the side of your head at a 90 degree angle. Take a foam roller and put it to the tips of the section of hair you're holding. Hold the tips of your hair to the roller with your fingers and then begin rolling inward toward your part so that more and more hair is wrapped around the roller. Roll until the roller is a few inches from your head.  When your hair roll is about three inches from your head, remove the roller from your hair roll, making sure not to undo the roll. Finish rolling your hair until the hair roll is piled on top of your head on one side of your part.         Make sure that you are rolling your hair inward toward your part as opposed to out away from it.  After you have finished rolling the first section of hair, use bobby pins to pin up the hair roll. Put one prong of the bobby pin inside the roll, and slide the other prong through the hair close to the scalp, so that the roll will stay in place. Repeat with several other pins to make sure your hair stays in place.  Using the same process, roll the other section of hair inward towards your part and clip with bobby pins. This should give you two tall hair rolls on the top of your head. This style is called a Victory Roll, and was popular in the 1940’s.  One way you can deal with the back portion of hair is to create additional rolls on the back of your head, below the top rolls.          You may decide to do a half-up look with the hair rolls, and leave the hair in back down. Use a curling iron to curl this hair if you wish. You can also clip the back section of hair up. Rather than making additional rolls, just clip this hair up under the rolls for a sleek look.  Take hairspray and spray, focusing on the hair rolls. This will set the hairstyle and make it less likely that there will be flyaways or major mishaps.        

apply styling mousse.  part hair down the middle.  spray hair with hairspray.  start rolling one section of hair.  remove the roller.  pin the hair roll.  roll the other front section of hair.  arrange the back section of hair as you wish.  use hairspray on the hair rolls. 

 Both LED and low-pressure sodium bulbs are very energy efficient for the light they produce. Low-pressure sodium bulbs produce a very warm light that does not heavily affect the atmosphere.It's vital when choosing LEDs that they are reduced in brightness/lumens, are fully shielded, and are a warm (yellow or amber) correlated color temperature (CCT) or 3000K or less (2700K is preferable).The key is to limit blue and green light emissions.; , Use reflectors outside to help light any pathways. This saves you from purchasing a whole row of lights to brighten the same pathway.Always opt for the more directed, lower light options where possible to avoid excess glare.  Bulb caps and shields ensure the light does not emit straight into the sky. These range from “non cutoff” all the way to “full cutoff” lights. Full cutoff shields prevent the largest amount of light "bleeding" among the shields., This helps prevent stray light from entering the atmosphere. Light reflecting off of the ground, even at night, provides plentiful light for night activities., These lights only turn on when they sense movement in their field of view. These can be placed on garden paths, near garages, around dark spaces and even in hallways. By turning on only when useful to someone, the lights pay for the investment rather quickly.If you have family members who need to use the bathroom frequently, these lights are more energy efficient than leaving one on all night.  There is no need to have your entire house lit up at all times. Turn off the lights in rooms that are not currently in use.   Turn off the lights when you exit a room, even if you are only leaving the room for a brief period of time. Try making signs and place them near light switches to remind everyone in the home to turn off the lights when they leave the room., Having a brilliantly lit party? Keep it inside and don't let the light glow out. Pull down the blinds, pull across the drapes and dim the switches just a bit to add to the mood.  "Cool" or lights on the blue end of the spectrum are harsh and more noticeable from a distance.Warmer lighting, such as those with yellow or orange hues, is less harsh and does not spread as easily into the atmosphere., Smart lighting kits are a great option for maintaining a greater level of control over your lights. Smart lights are able to be controlled and programmed through your smart device, allowing for a pinpoint level of efficiency in your home.Dim your lights according to the task at hand, and save the setting for later use. This can give you the minimum lighting you need at the press of a button. Program your smart lights to turn on only at particular hours of the day, or to turn off at certain intervals. This ensures that all of your lights will be off when you leave for work, even if you forget to turn them off yourself. Smart lights can also be controlled remotely. If you have left the house and a light has been left on, you can turn them off from your smart device.  Activities that require strong lighting, such as painting walls or artwork, sewing, and cleaning, are best left to when the sun provides a light source.   Painting for example requires strong, white light to properly display the true values of the colors you are working with. This light can easily bleed from your windows., Many people either don't know about or don't understand sky glow and the negative impacts too much light at night. Be an ambassador and explain the issues to others. You will then have growing ranks of night sky protectors.   Show them images of what the night sky looks like without light pollution. NASA has an assortment of images that can help argue your case by showing the beauty of the night sky., Fighting light pollution requires a group effort. Even a few houses in a neighborhood can make a noticeable difference in night sky visibility.   Reach out to your neighbors in a friendly manner. Consider sending them a letter or bringing it up during a block party. Many people are unaware that their lights are harmful or distracting. Suggest alternatives to their existing lights, and offer to help them choose and install replacements., Suggest that they change local street lights to more eco-friendly variations. There are a variety of new street lamps that are designed to reduce light pollution as well as cut back on costs., Several awareness groups dedicated to light pollution have been created in recent years. They offer a way to put your head together with like-minded individuals to create change on a larger scale.These awareness groups provide additional tips for eco-friendly lighting, as well as which lighting products are healthiest for the environment.  Many buildings have begun building “green” in order to become more eco-friendly. If the building where you work is renovating or if new construction is starting in your neighborhood, ask the party responsible about their plans to combat light pollution.   Direct your employer to organizations such as LEED. LEED recognizes and certifies buildings that build green, which can help bring some positive attention to your company. 

install led or low-pressure sodium bulbs.  direct light to where it is needed.  purchase lights with bulb caps and shields.  aim your outdoor lights downward.  install motion detector lights.  turn off lights you are not using.  pull down the blinds.  use "warm" lights in your house lighting.  install smart lights.  leave some activities for daytime only.  spread the word to your family and friends.  reach out to the neighborhood.  write a letter to your city council.  join a light pollution awareness group.  support green buildings.
